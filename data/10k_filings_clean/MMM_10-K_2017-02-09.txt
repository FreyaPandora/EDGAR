benefit cost asc requires employer to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension or postretirement plan an asset or liability in it statement of financial position and recognize change in the funded status in the year in which the change occur through accumulated other comprehensive income which is component of stockholder equity while the company belief the valuation method used to determine the fair value of plan asset are appropriate and consistent with other market participant the use of different methodology or assumption to determine the fair value of certain financial instrument could result in different estimate of fair value at the reporting date see note for additional discussion of actuarial assumption used in determining defined benefit pension and postretirement health care liability and expense pension benefit associated with these plan are generally based primarily on each participant year of service compensation and age at retirement or termination the benefit obligation represents the present value of the benefit that employee are entitled to in the future for service already rendered of the measurement date the company measure the present value of these future benefit by projecting benefit payment cash flow for each future period and discounting these cash flow back to the december measurement date using the yield of portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument that would produce cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefit historically the single aggregated discount rate used for each plan benefit obligation wa also used for the calculation of all net periodic benefit cost including the measurement of the service and interest cost beginning in changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost component of the net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost the new method measure service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation service cost are determined based on duration specific spot rate applied to the service cost cash flow the interest cost calculation is determined by applying duration specific spot rate to the year by year projected benefit payment the spot yield curve approach doe not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost offset in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in other comprehensive income the company changed to the new method to provide more precise measure of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flow and the discrete spot yield curve rate the company accounted for this change change in estimate prospectively beginning in the first quarter of using this methodology the company determined discount rate for it plan follow qualified pension international pension weighted average postretirement medical december liability benefit obligation net periodic benefit cost component service cost interest cost another significant element in determining the company pension expense in accordance with

impairment of december net property plant and equipment totaled billion and net identifiable intangible asset totaled billion management make estimate and assumption in preparing the consolidated

these estimate and assumption are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted circumstance warrant for instance expected asset life may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group of the billion in net identifiable intangible asset billion relates to indefinite lived tradenames primarily capital safety whose tradenames million at acquisition date have been in existence for over year refer to note for more detail the primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible asset tradenames is discounted cash flow approach specifically relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sale with the resulting amount discounted using an appropriate market technology discount rate the relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate market participant would pay to acquire the right to market produce the product if the resulting discounted cash flow are le than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment exists and the asset value must be written down based on impairment testing in the third quarter of no impairment wa indicated the discounted cash flow related to the capital safety tradename exceeded it book value by more than percent goodwill totaled approximately billion of december annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to reporting unit reporting unit are one level below the business segment level can be combined when reporting unit within the same segment have similar economic characteristic at reporting unit correspond to division did not combine any of it reporting unit for impairment testing an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit net asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by price earnings ratio for comparable industry group or by using discounted cash flow analysis typically us the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing business that have long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flow us the discounted cash flow approach for start up loss position and declining business in addition to business where the price earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted also us discounted cash flow an additional tool for business that may be growing at slower rate than planned due to economic or other condition described in note effective in the first quarter of made product line reporting change involving two of it business segment for any product move that resulted in reporting unit change the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting unit during the first quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time table of content of october had primary reporting unit with ten reporting unit accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill these ten reporting unit were comprised of the following division advanced material communication market display material and system health information system industrial adhesive and tape infection prevention oral care solution personal safety which includes the capital safety acquisition separation and purification which includes the membrana acquisition and traffic safety and security the estimated fair value for these reporting unit were in excess of carrying value by approximately percent or more except for one reporting unit with approximately million of goodwill where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately percent market value at both december and september wa significantly in excess of it shareholder equity of approximately billion and billion at december and september respectively in primarily used an industry price earnings ratio approach but also used discounted cash flow approach for certain reporting unit to determine fair value where applicable used weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for certain division using projected cash flow that were weighted based on different sale growth and terminal value assumption among other factor the weighting wa based on management estimate of the likelihood of each scenario occurring is an integrated material enterprise thus many of business could not easily be sold on stand alone basis focus on research and development ha resulted in portion of value being comprised of internally developed business that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of no goodwill impairment wa indicated for any of the reporting unit factor which could result in future impairment charge include among others change in worldwide economic condition change in competitive condition and customer preference and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate these risk factor are discussed in item risk factor of this document in addition change in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing result indicated above during the first quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by change between reporting unit and determined that no impairment existed long lived asset with definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future non cash asset impairment charge are taken would expect that portion of the long lived asset or goodwill would be impaired will continue to monitor it reporting unit and asset group in for any triggering event or other indicator of impairment income tax the extent of operation involves dealing with uncertainty and judgment in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction the final tax paid are dependent upon many factor including negotiation with taxing authority in various jurisdiction and resolution of dispute arising from federal state and

entity is the principal in the transaction or to arrange for the third party to provide the underlying good or service the entity is the agent in the transaction the amendment clarify in term of identifying performance obligation how entity would determine whether promised good or service are separately identifiable from other promise in contract and therefore would be accounted for separately the guidance allows entity to disregard good or service that are immaterial in the context of contract and provides an accounting policy election to account for shipping and handling activity fulfillment cost rather than additional promised service with regard to the licensing the amendment clarify how an entity would evaluate the nature of it promise in granting license of intellectual property which determines whether the entity recognizes revenue over time or at point in time the amendment also address implementation issue relative to transition adding practical

condition for the majority of revenue arrangement no significant impact are expected these transaction are not accounted for under industry specific guidance that will be superseded by the asu and generally consist of single performance obligation to transfer promised good or service however in addition to expanded disclosure regarding revenue the asu could for example impact the timing of

entity will no longer be able to recognize unrealized holding gain and loss on equity security they classify under current guidance available for sale in other comprehensive income oci they also will no longer be able to use the cost method of accounting for equity security that do not have readily determinable fair value instead for these type of equity investment that do not otherwise qualify for the net asset value practical expedient entity will be permitted to elect practicability exception and measure the investment at cost le impairment plus or minus observable price change in orderly transaction the asu also establishes an incremental recognition and disclosure requirement related to the presentation of fair value change of financial liability for which the fair value option fvo ha been elected under this guidance an entity would be required to separately present in oci the portion of the total fair value change attributable to instrument specific credit risk opposed to

input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the hierarchy is broken down

activity legal proceeding the company and some of it subsidiary are involved in numerous claim and lawsuit principally in the united state and regulatory proceeding worldwide these include various product liability involving product that the company or formerly manufactured and sold intellectual property and commercial claim and lawsuit including table of content those brought under the antitrust law and environmental proceeding unless otherwise stated the company is vigorously defending all such litigation process for disclosure and recording of liability and insurance receivables related to legal proceeding many lawsuit and claim involve highly complex issue relating to causation scientific evidence and whether there are actual damage and are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainty assessment of lawsuit and claim can involve series of complex judgment about future event and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption the company complies with the requirement of asc contingency and related guidance and record liability for legal proceeding in those instance where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is range the company record the most likely estimate of the loss or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate the company either discloses the amount of possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accrual if estimable or state that such an estimate can not be made the company discloses significant legal proceeding even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both if the company belief there is at least reasonable possibility that loss may be incurred the company estimate insurance receivables based on an analysis of it numerous policy including their exclusion pertinent case law interpreting comparable policy it experience with similar claim and assessment of the nature of the claim and remaining coverage and record an amount it ha concluded is likely to be recovered for those insured matter where the company ha taken an accrual the company also record receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the company insurance program for those insured matter where the company ha not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both but where the company ha incurred an expense in defending itself the company record receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling or development could occur there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charge in excess of presently recorded liability future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charge that could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or cash flow in the period in which they are recorded although the company can not estimate it exposure to all legal proceeding it currently belief that such future charge if any would not have material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company based on experience and development the company reexamines it estimate of probable liability and associated expense and receivables each period and whether it is able to estimate liability previously determined to be not estimable and or not probable where appropriate the company make addition to or adjustment of it estimated liability result the current estimate of the potential impact on the company consolidated financial position result of operation and cash flow for the legal proceeding and claim pending against the company could change in the future the following section first describe the significant legal proceeding in which the company is involved and then describe the liability and associated insurance receivables the company ha accrued relating to it significant legal proceeding respirator mask asbestos litigation of december the company is named defendant with multiple co defendant in numerous lawsuit in various court that purport to represent approximately individual claimant compared to approximately individual claimant with action pending at december the vast majority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company mask and respirator product and seek damage from the company and other defendant for alleged personal injury from workplace exposure to asbestos silica coal mine dust or other occupational dust found in product manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace minority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from product previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified well product manufactured by other defendant or occasionally at company premise table of content the company current volume of new and pending matter is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filing in the company expects that filing of claim by unimpaired claimant in the future will continue to be at much lower level than in the past accordingly the number of claim alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma and other malignancy will represent greater percentage of total claim than in the past the company ha prevailed in all eleven case taken to trial including nine of the ten case tried to verdict such trial occurred in and described below and an appellate reversal in of the jury verdict adverse to the company the remaining case tried in wa dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff evidence based on the court legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support jury verdict in august received unanimous defense verdict from jury in state court in kentucky in first respirator trial involving coal mine dust the estate of the plaintiff alleged that the respirator is defective and caused death because it did not protect from harmful coal mine dust the jury rejected plaintiff claim and returned verdict finding no liability against the verdict is final the plaintiff did not file an appeal the company ha demonstrated in these past trial proceeding that it respiratory protection product are effective claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstance consequently the company belief that claimant are unable to establish that their medical condition even if significant are attributable to the company respiratory protection product nonetheless the company litigation experience indicates that claim of person with malignant condition are costlier to resolve than the claim of unimpaired person and it therefore belief the average cost of resolving pending and future claim on per claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior period when the vast majority of claim were asserted by medically unimpaired claimant previously reported the state of west virginia through it attorney general filed complaint in against the company and two other manufacturer of respiratory protection product in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia and amended it complaint in the amended complaint seek substantial but unspecified compensatory damage primarily for reimbursement of the cost allegedly incurred by the state for worker compensation and healthcare benefit provided to all worker with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damage the case wa inactive from the fourth quarter of until late other than case management conference in march in november the state filed motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damage proceeding at the hearing on the motion the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit no liability ha been recorded for this matter because the company belief that liability is not probable and estimable at this time in addition the company is not able to estimate possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery response by the state of west virginia the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claim against two other manufacturer where defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault if any jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried respirator mask asbestos liability and insurance receivables the company annually conduct comprehensive legal review of it respirator mask

provides the claim data to third party with expertise in determining the impact of claim data on future filing trend and cost the third party assist the company in estimating the cost to defend and resolve pending and future claim the company us these estimate to develop it best estimate of probable liability development may occur that could affect the company estimate of it liability these development include but are not limited to significant change in the key assumption underlying the company accrual including the number of future claim the nature and mix of those claim the average cost of defending and resolving claim and in table of content maintaining trial readiness ii trial and appellate outcome iii the law and procedure applicable to these claim and iv the financial viability of other co defendant and insurer result of the company regular comprehensive legal review and underlying factor such the cost of resolving claim of person who claim more serious injury including mesothelioma and other malignancy the company recorded an expense in for respirator mask asbestos liability of million in the company made payment for legal fee and settlement of million related to the respirator mask asbestos litigation of december and the company had an accrual for respirator mask asbestos liability excluding aearo accrual of million and million respectively this accrual represents the company best estimate of probable loss and reflects an estimation period for future claim that may be filed against the company approaching the year refer to note for further detail on the revision of this accrual the company can not estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amount by which the liability may exceed the accrual the company ha established because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claim may be asserted ii the complaint nearly always assert claim against multiple defendant where the damage alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendant so that defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state iii the multiple factor described above that the company considers in estimating it liability and iv the several possible development described above that may occur that could affect the
