service performance applied technology product innovation and product recognition brand identity service to customer and quality are important competitive factor for our product and service and there is considerable price competition other competitive factor include breadth of product line research and development effort and technical and managerial capability our competitive position varies among our product and service we believe we are significant competitor in each of our major product and service class many of our competitor substantial financial resource and significant technological capability in addition some of our product compete with the captive component division of oems aerospace sale our aerospace segment sale were and of our total sale in and our sale to commercial aerospace oems were and of our total sale in and in addition our sale to commercial aftermarket customer of aerospace product and service were and of our total sale in and government sale sale to the government principally by aerospace acting through it various department and agency and through prime contractor amounted to million million and million in and which included sale to the department of defense prime contractor and subcontractor of million million and million in and we not expect our overall operating result to be significantly affected by any proposed change in federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government program which impact oems production engineering development program aftermarket spare and repair and overhaul program well our diversified commercial business backlog our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contract starting in following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligation under the contract that meet the new guidance on revenue from contract with customer discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement backlog wa million and million at december and we expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligation revenue in and the remaining balance thereafter international operation we are engaged in manufacturing sale service and research and development globally export and non manufactured product are significant to our operation export comprised of our total sale in in and in non manufactured product and service mainly in europe and asia were of our total sale in in and in manufactured product and system andperformance of service year ended december aerospace honeywellbuildingtechnologies performancematerials andtechnologies safety andproductivitysolutions of segment sale export non information related to risk attendant to our foreign operation is included in item risk factor under the caption macroeconomic and industry risk raw material the principal raw material used in our operation are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw material supply we experienced no significant problem in the purchase of key raw material or commodity in we are not dependent on any one supplier for material amount of our raw material the cost of certain key raw material including copper fluorspar tungsten salt ethylene and perchloroethylene in performance material and technology and nickel steel titanium and other metal in aerospace are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increase with formula or long term supply agreement price increase and hedging activity feasible we do not presently anticipate that shortage of raw material will cause any material adverse impact during patent trademark license and distribution right our segment are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patent or any license or distribution right in our judgment our intellectual property right are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the right under our patent trademark and license are generally important to our operation we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution right related to specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business environment we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirement regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that general matter our policy practice and procedure are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operation and product it is with other company engaged in similar business we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacturing use and disposal of many substance classified hazardous by one or more regulatory agency we believe that general matter our policy practice and procedure are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of substance are in accord with environmental and safety law and regulation it is also possible that future knowledge or other development such improved capability to detect substance in the environment or increasingly strict environmental law and standard and enforcement policy could bring question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substance among other environmental requirement we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign law and regulation under which we have been designated potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup cost associated with current and former operating site and various hazardous waste site some of which are on the environmental protection agency national priority list although there is possibility that responsible party might have to bear more it proportional share of the cleanup cost if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible party we do not anticipate to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi party situation taken whole we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaty or accord are reasonably likely to have material effect in the foreseeable future on the company business or market that it serf on it result of operation capital expenditure earnings competitive position or financial standing we will

management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and in other part of this report including this item such discussion contain forward looking statement within the meaning of section of the security exchange act of forward looking statement are those that address activity event or development that management intends expects project belief or anticipates will or may occur in the future they are based on management assumption and assessment in light of past experience and trend current economic and industry condition expected future development and other relevant factor they are not guarantee of future performance and actual result development and business decision may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward looking statement we do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward looking statement our forward looking statement are also subject to risk and uncertainty that affect our performance in the near and long term these forward looking statement be considered in light of the information included in this form including in particular the factor discussed these factor may be revised or supplemented in subsequent report on form and risk factor our business operating result cash flow and financial condition are subject to the principal risk and uncertainty set forth below any one of which could cause our actual result to vary materially from recent result or from our anticipated future result macroeconomic and industry risk industry and economic condition may adversely affect the market and operating condition of our customer which in turn can affect demand for our product and service and our result of operation aerospace operating result of aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic condition well change in customer buying pattern of aftermarket part supplier stability factory transition and global supply chain capacity constraint that may lead to shortage of crucial component the operating result of our commercial aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturn in the global demand for air travel which impact new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft order delay in launch schedule for new aircraft the retirement of aircraft and global flying hour which impact air transport regional business and general aviation aircraft utilization rate operating result could also be impacted by change in overall trend related to end market demand for the product portfolio well new entrant and non traditional player entering the market operating result in our defense and space business unit may be affected by the mix of and foreign government appropriation for defense and space program and by compliance risk result may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit part into our global supply chain honeywell building technology operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in the level of global commercial construction activity including retrofit and upgrade lower capital spending and operating expenditure on building project le industrial plant expansion change in the competitive landscape including new market entrant and new technology and fluctuation in inventory level in distribution channel performance material and technology operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plant our customer availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion raw material demand and supply volatility product commoditization and our ability to maximize our facility production capacity and minimize downtime in particular the volatility in oil and natural gas price have and will continue to impact our customer operating level and capital spending and thus demand for our product and service safety and productivity solution operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditure including in the oil and gas industry reduced investment in process automation safety monitoring and plant capacity utilization initiative fluctuation in retail market lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trend related to end market demand change in the competitive landscape including new market entrant and technology that may lead to product commoditization and adverse industry economic condition all of which could result in lower market share reduced selling price and lower margin an increasing percentage of our sale and operation is in non jurisdiction and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risk of international operation our international operation including export represent more than half of the company sale risk related to international operation include exchange control regulation wage and price control antitrust regulation employment regulation foreign investment law import export and other trade restriction such sanction and embargo violation by our employee of anti corruption law despite our effort to mitigate these risk change in regulation regarding transaction with state owned enterprise nationalization of private enterprise act of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employee in these region instability and uncertainty arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political regulatory and economic landscape the potential for change in global trade policy including sanction and trade barrier trend such populism economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational company and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulation worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategy for growing our business well our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margin while it is currently not known the final outcome and full term of the united kingdom future relationship with the european union will be it is possible that there will be greater restriction on import and export the united kingdom and other country including the united state increased tariff on import and export and increased regulatory complexity existing free trade law and regulation such the north american free trade agreement or any successor agreement provide certain beneficial duty and tariff for qualifying import and export change in law or policy governing the term of foreign trade and in particular increased trade restriction tariff or tax on import from country where we manufacture product or from where we import product or raw material either directly or through our supplier could have an impact on our competitive position and financial result operating outside of the united state also expose to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activity however foreign exchange hedging activity bear financial cost and may not always be available to or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amount of cash outside of the united state that is invested with financial and non financial counterparties while we employ comprehensive control regarding global cash management to guard cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operation and commitment material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss risk related to our defined benefit pension plan may adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow significant change in actual investment return on pension asset discount rate and other factor could adversely affect our result of operation and require cash pension contribution in future period change in discount rate and actual asset return different than our anticipated asset return can result in significant non cash actuarial gain or loss which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim measurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contribution funding requirement for our pension plan are largely dependent upon interest rate actual investment return on pension asset and the impact of legislative or regulatory change related to pension funding obligation operational risk raw material price fluctuation the ability of key supplier to meet quality and delivery requirement or catastrophic event can increase the cost of our product and service impact our ability to meet commitment to customer and cause to incur significant liability the cost of raw material is key element in the cost of our product particularly in performance material and technology copper fluorspar tungsten salt ethylene and perchloroethylene and in aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metal our inability to offset material price inflation through increased price to customer formula or long term fixed price contract with supplier productivity action or through commodity hedge could adversely affect our result of operation many major component product equipment item and raw material particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on single or sole source basis although we maintain qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that source of supply for raw material and component are generally adequate it is difficult to predict what effect shortage or price increase may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirement may be constrained by our supplier inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long lead time product during time of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply need would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligation under commercial and government contract which could in turn result in reduced sale and profit contract penalty or termination and damage to customer relationship we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisition and divestiture may not occur planned we regularly review our portfolio of business and pursue growth through acquisition and seek to divest non core business we may not be able to complete transaction on favorable term on timely basis or at all and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issue in addition our result of operation and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired business to meet or exceed expected return including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired business into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and or to achieve expected synergy iii the inability to dispose of non core asset and business on satisfactory term and condition iv the discovery of unanticipated liability labor relation difficulty or other problem in acquired business for which we lack contractual protection insurance or indemnity or with regard to divested business claim by purchaser to whom we have provided contractual indemnification and the inability to collect on the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with our spin offs garrett motion inc and resideo technology inc our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technology and introduce new product that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive market with acceptable margin our future growth rate depends upon number of factor including our ability to identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trend in our target end market ii develop and maintain competitive product iii defend our market share against an ever expanding number of competitor including many new and non traditional competitor iv enhance our product by adding innovative feature that differentiate our product from those of our competitor and prevent commoditization of our product develop manufacture and bring compelling new product to market quickly and cost effectively vi monitor disruptive technology and business model vii achieve sufficient return on investment for new product introduced based on capital expenditure and research and development spending viii respond to change in overall trend related to end market demand and attract develop and retain individual with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customer need to develop new technology and introduce new product competitor may also develop after market service and part for our product which attract customer and adversely affect our return on investment for new product the failure of our technology or product to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offering by our competitor or the failure to address any of the factor could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospect failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvement well an inability to successfully execute repositioning project or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvement in addition we seek productivity and cost saving benefit through repositioning action and project such consolidation of manufacturing facility transition to cost competitive region and product line rationalization risk associated with these action include delay in execution of the planned initiative additional unexpected cost realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvement and adverse effect on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefit we expect the recognition of these benefit may be delayed and these action may potentially disrupt our operation in addition organizational change increased attrition failure to create and implement succession plan for key company position not retaining key talent inability to attract new employee with unique skill labor relation difficulty or workforce stoppage could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation supplier to the government we are subject to unique risk such the right of the government to terminate contract for convenience and to conduct audit and investigation of our operation and performance government contract are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the term of the applicable contract our contract with the government are also subject to government audit that may recommend downward price adjustment and other change appropriate and prudent we have made adjustment and paid voluntary refund in the past and may do in the future we are also subject to government investigation of business practice and compliance with government procurement regulation if result of any such investigation or other government investigation including investigation of violation of certain environmental employment or export law honeywell or one of it business were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving award of new government contract suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceeding and or have it export privilege suspended our operation and the prior operation of predecessor company expose to the risk of material environmental liability mainly of past operation and operation of predecessor company we are subject to potentially material liability related to the remediation of environmental hazard and to claim of personal injury or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance release and exposure we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean cost for site contamination and are party to lawsuit and claim associated with environmental and safety matter including past production of product containing hazardous substance additional lawsuit claim and cost involving environmental matter are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign government regulate the discharge of material into the environment or the use of or communication respecting certain material in our product and can impose substantial fine and criminal sanction for violation and require injunctive relief measure including installation of costly equipment or operational change to limit emission and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance release or limiting access of our product to market among others in addition change in law regulation and enforcement of policy the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual site the establishment of stricter toxicity standard with respect to certain contaminant or the imposition of new clean up requirement or remedial technique could require to incur additional cost in the future that would have negative effect on our financial condition or result of operation cybersecurity incident could disrupt business operation result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and result of operation global cybersecurity threat and incident can range from uncoordinated individual attempt to gain unauthorized access to information technology it system to sophisticated and targeted measure known advanced persistent threat directed at the company it product it customer and or it third party service provider including cloud provider our customer including the government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protection and mandating cybersecurity standard in our product and we may incur additional cost to comply with such demand while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these type of threat and incident none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measure to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threat including identity and access control data protection vulnerability assessment product software design which we believe are le susceptible to cyber attack continuous monitoring of our it network and system and maintenance of backup and protective system despite these effort cybersecurity incident depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our or that of third party and the disruption of business operation cybersecurity incident aimed at the software imbedded in our product could lead to third party claim that our product failure have caused similar range of damage to our customer and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our product the potential consequence of material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third party theft of intellectual property fine levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation cost due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threat which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and result of operation data privacy identity protection and information security may require significant resource and present certain risk we collect store have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data including proprietary business information personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security law regulation and or customer imposed control despite our effort to protect such data we may be vulnerable to material security breach theft misplaced or lost data programming error or employee error that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data improper use of our system software solution or network unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of information defective product production downtime and operational disruption in addition we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy law in effect in the various state and foreign jurisdiction in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdiction while ensuring the data is secure for example the state of california recently passed legislation granting resident certain new data privacy right and regulating the security of internet of thing device which will go into effect in january european law require to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data of europe the european union general data protection regulation which took effect in may superseded prior european union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirement in we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalty for noncompliance and several other country have passed law that require personal data relating to their citizen to be maintained on local server and impose additional data transfer restriction government enforcement action can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business and violation of data privacy law can result in fine reputational damage and civil lawsuit any of which may adversely affect our business reputation and financial statement material disruption of our operation particularly at our manufacturing facility or within our information technology infrastructure could adversely affect our business our facility supply chain distribution system and information technology system are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disaster including hurricane and flood power outage fire explosion terrorism equipment failure sabotage adverse weather condition public health crisis labor dispute critical supply failure inaccurate downtime forecast political disruption and other reason which can result in undesirable consequence including financial loss and damaged relationship with customer we employ information technology system and network to support the business and rely on them to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of business process and activity disruption to our information technology infrastructure from system failure shutdown power outage telecommunication or utility failure and other event including disruption at our cloud computing server system and other third party it service provider could interfere with our operation interrupt production and shipment damage customer and business partner relationship and negatively impact our reputation legal and regulatory risk our and non tax liability are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdiction in which we operate our future result of operation could be adversely affected by change in the effective tax rate result of change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in tax law regulation and judicial ruling or change in the interpretation thereof potential expansion of taxation on digital service change in generally accepted accounting principle change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability change in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the result of audit and examination of previously filed tax return and continuing assessment of our tax exposure and various other governmental enforcement initiative our tax expense includes estimate of tax reserve and reflects other estimate and assumption including assessment of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax asset change in tax law or regulation including regulatory development arising from tax reform legislation well multi jurisdictional change enacted in response to the action item provided by the organization for economic co operation and development oecd will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income tax change in legislation or government regulation or policy can have significant impact on our result of operation the sale and margin of each of our segment are directly impacted by government regulation including safety performance and product certification regulation within aerospace the operating result of commercial original equipment and commercial aftermarket may be impacted by among other thing mandate of the federal aviation administration and other similar international regulatory body requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft our defense and space business unit may be affected by change in government procurement regulation within honeywell building technology the demand for and cost of providing product service and solution can be impacted by fire security safety health care environmental and energy efficiency standard and regulation performance material and technology result of operation can be impacted by environmental standard regulation and judicial determination growth in all our business within emerging market may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employee where local employment law mandate may be restrictive noncompliance with legislation and regulation can result in fine and penalty increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international regional and or federal requirement to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulation could mandate even more restrictive standard such stricter limit on greenhouse gas emission than the voluntary commitment that the company ha made or require such change on more accelerated time frame there continues to be lack of consistent climate legislation which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty if environmental law or regulation are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restriction and compliance requirement upon the company or it product they could negatively impact the company business capital expenditure result of operation financial condition and competitive position we can not predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matter government proceeding and other contingency and uncertainty we are subject to number of lawsuit investigation and dispute some of which involve substantial amount claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matter relating to commercial transaction government contract product liability including asbestos prior acquisition and divestiture employment employee benefit plan intellectual property antitrust accounting import and export and environmental health and safety matter our potential liability are subject to change time due to new development change in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirement and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage award or settlement that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow and financial condition while we maintain insurance for certain risk the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claim and liability the incurrence of significant liability for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our result of operation cash flow liquidity and financial condition item unresolved staff comment none item property we have approximately location of which are manufacturing site our property and equipment are in good operating

the result of operation for htsi are included in the consolidated statement of operation through the effective date of the sale executive summary during honeywell continued to deliver on our financial commitment and to create long term shareowner value we grew net sale to million and grew income tax to million the improvement in year over year income before tax wa attributable to both sale growth well operational improvement that increased operating margin we believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent rigorous deployment of the honeywell operating system well long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiative we have continued our focus on commercial excellence process such velocity product development vpd to drive higher sale at better margin we are careful not to allow the attainment of short term financial result to imperil the creation of long term sustainable shareowner value hence part of the announcement in october of the result of our portfolio review we affirmed our commitment to strategy and investment that are intended to enable to become one of the world leading software industrial company our refocused strategy and investment are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strength in high growth business that participate in six attractive industrial end market each of these end market is characterized by favorable global mega trend including energy efficiency infrastructure investment urbanization and safety in we deployed capital of billion including the following capital investment we invested over billion in capital expenditure focused on high return project dividend in we paid cash dividend of billion and increased our annual dividend rate by we seek to continue to grow the dividend in line with earnings the dividend increase in september marked the ninth consecutive double digit increase since share repurchase we continue to repurchase our share with the goal of keeping share count flat and by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and saving plan additionally we seek to reduce share count via share repurchase and when attractive opportunity arise in we repurchased million share for billion merger and acquisition we deployed approximately billion during on acquisition consolidated result of operation net sale net sale change compared with prior period the change in net sale is attributable to the following volume price acquisition divestiture foreign currency translation discussion of net sale by segment can be found in the review of business segment section of this management discussion and analysis the foreign currency translation impact in compared with wa principally driven by the strengthening on average year over year of the euro against the dollar the foreign currency translation impact in compared with wa flat the strengthening of the euro wa offset by the weakening of the british pound against the dollar cost of product and service sold cost of product and service sold change compared with prior period gross margin percentage cost of product and service sold increased in compared

due to increased labor cost driven primarily by acquisition net of divestiture investment for growth and merit increase and higher repositioning charge other income expense other income expense other income expense increased in compared with primarily due to an increase in pension ongoing income non service favorable impact of foreign currency and an increase in interest income partially offset by separation cost associated with the spin offs of our home and global distribution business and transportation system business other income expense increased in compared with primarily due to due to an increase in pension ongoing income non service tax expense tax expense effective tax rate the effective tax rate for wa lower than the federal statutory rate of primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiative that resulted in reduction of accrued withholding tax of approximately billion related to unremitted foreign earnings in addition we recorded tax benefit of approximately million reduction to our provisional estimate of impact from what is commonly referred to the tax cut and job act tax reform which wa partially offset by million of tax cost associated with the internal restructuring of the home and global distribution business and the transportation system business in advance of their spin offs the effective tax rate for wa higher than the federal statutory rate of primarily from the estimated impact of tax reform of approximately billion partially offset by lower tax rate on non earnings the effective tax rate for wa lower than the federal statutory

to honeywell net income attributable to honeywell earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution increased in compared with primarily driven by the lower income tax expense due to reduction of accrued withholding tax and the higher comparative income tax in from tax reform higher segment profit increased pension and other postretirement income and lower share count partially offset by separation cost and higher repositioning and other charge earnings per share of common stock assuming dilution decreased in compared with primarily driven by additional income tax expense from tax reform higher repositioning and other charge partially offset by higher segment profit across all segment lower pension mark to market expense and increased pension and other postretirement income business overview our consolidated result are principally impacted by change in global economic growth rate and industry condition and demand in our key end market the impact of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate in particular the euro relative to the dollar the extent to which cost saving from productivity action are able to offset or

consolidated financial statement for further discussion on the agreement critical accounting policy the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle is based on the selection and application of accounting policy that require to make significant estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policy discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statement actual result could differ from our estimate and assumption and any such difference could be material to our consolidated financial statement contingent liability we are subject to number of lawsuit investigation and claim some of which involve substantial dollar amount that arise out of the conduct of our global business operation or those of previously owned entity including matter relating to commercial transaction government contract product liability including asbestos prior acquisition and divestiture employee benefit plan intellectual property legal and environmental health and safety matter we continually ass the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to our contingency well potential amount or range of probable loss and recognize liability if any for these contingency based on thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other expert such analysis includes making judgment concerning matter such the cost associated with environmental matter the outcome of negotiation the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claim and the impact of evidentiary requirement because most contingency are resolved over long period of time liability may change in the future due to new development including new discovery of fact change in legislation and outcome of similar case through the judicial system change in assumption or change in our settlement strategy see note commitment and contingency of note to consolidated financial statement for discussion of management judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liability which represent our most significant contingency asbestos related liability and insurance recovery and indemnification receivables honeywell involvement in asbestos related personal injury action relates to two predecessor company regarding north american refractory company narco asbestos related claim we accrued for pending claim based on term and condition in agreement with narco it former parent company and certain asbestos claimant and an estimate of the unsettled claim pending of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claim expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claim wa prepared in in the year narco filed for bankruptcy protection using narco tort system litigation experience based on commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy court addressing trust accordingly the estimated value of future narco asbestos claim wa prepared before there wa data on claim filing and payment rate in the narco trust under the trust distribution procedure and prepared when the stay of all narco asbestos claim wa in effect which remained in effect until narco emerged from bankruptcy protection some critical assumption underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claim filing rate disease criterion and payment value contained in the trust distribution procedure estimated approval rate of claim submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological study estimating disease instance this estimate resulted in range of estimated liability of million to million we believe that no amount within this range is better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range given the trust lack of sufficiently reliable claim data since narco emerged from bankruptcy protection it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim cost based on actual narco trust experience regarding bendix friction material bendix asbestos related claim we accrued for the estimated value of pending claim using average resolution value for the previous five year we also accrued for the estimated value of future claim related to bendix over the full term of epidemiological projection through based on historic and anticipated claim filing experience and dismissal rate disease classification and average resolution value in the tort system for the previous five year in connection with the recognition of liability for asbestos related matter we record asbestos related insurance recovery that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgment concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealing and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issue surrounding insurer while the substantial majority of our insurance carrier are solvent some of our individual carrier are insolvent which ha been considered in our analysis of probable recovery projecting future event is subject to various uncertainty that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liability to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projection we reevaluate our projection concerning our probable insurance recovery considering any change to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factor that may impact future insurance recovery additionally in conjunction with the garrett spin off the company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with garrett subsidiary pursuant to which garrett subsidiary ha an obligation to make cash payment to honeywell reimbursement for asbestos liability accordingly the company ha recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable which is subject to term of applicable credit agreement of garrett and it general ability to pay see note commitment and contingency of note to consolidated financial statement for discussion of management judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liability and related insurance recovery and additional detail regarding the indemnification and reimbursement agreement defined benefit pension plan we sponsor both funded and unfunded and non defined benefit pension plan for financial reporting purpose net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon number of actuarial assumption including discount rate for plan obligation and an expected long term rate of return on plan asset change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of service and interest cost assumed return on plan asset prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense and potential mark to market adjustment mtm adjustment the key assumption used in developing our and net periodic pension income expense for our plan included the following discount rate projected benefit obligation service cost interest cost asset expected rate of return actual rate of return actual year average annual compounded rate of return the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gain or loss in excess of of the greater of the fair value of plan asset or the plan projected benefit obligation the corridor net actuarial gain and loss occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumption used to value our pension plan or when assumption change the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss are change in the discount rate used to value pension obligation of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual return on plan asset the mark to market accounting method result in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustment mtm charge were million million and million in and we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan asset utilizing historical plan asset return over varying long term period combined with our expectation of future market condition and asset mix consideration see note pension and other postretirement benefit of note to consolidated financial statement for detail on the actual various asset class and targeted asset allocation percentage for our pension plan we plan to use an expected rate of return on plan asset of for from for reflecting re balancing of asset to more fixed income during the discount rate reflects the market rate on december measurement date for high quality fixed income investment with maturity corresponding to our benefit obligation and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year it is determined based upon prevailing interest rate of the measurement date we used discount rate to determine benefit obligation of december reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year end in addition to the potential for mtm adjustment change in our expected rate of return on plan asset and discount rate resulting from economic event also affect future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlight the sensitivity of our pension obligation and ongoing income expense to change in these assumption assuming all other assumption remain constant these estimate exclude any potential mtm adjustment change in assumption impact on ongoingexpense impact on pbo percentage point decrease in discount rate decrease million increase million percentage point increase in discount rate increase million decrease million percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on asset increase million percentage point increase in expected rate of return on asset decrease million pension ongoing income for our world wide pension plan is expected to be approximately million in compared with pension ongoing income of million in the expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower actual asset return in and lower expected return on asset assumption for in our and uk plan also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of in accordance with our pension accounting method previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be mtm adjustment in and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustment are primarily driven by event and circumstance beyond the control of the company such change in interest rate and the performance of the financial market long lived asset including tangible and finite lived intangible asset the determination of useful life for depreciation amortization purpose and whether or not tangible and intangible asset are impaired involves the use of accounting estimate and assumption change in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual result differ from such estimate and assumption we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factor in considering when to perform an impairment review are follows significant under performance decline in sale earnings or cash flow of business or product line in relation to expectation annual operating plan or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of business or product line significant negative industry or economic trend or significant change or planned change in our use of the asset it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of asset is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and it fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market price if available level or level of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level of the fair value hierarchy the key estimate in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumption to expected industry and business growth rate sale volume selling price and cost cash flow and the discount rate selected these estimate are subject to change in the economic environment including market interest rate and expected volatility management belief the estimate of future cash flow and fair value are reasonable however change in estimate due to variance from assumption could materially affect the valuation goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset the fair value is estimated utilizing discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecast in our five year strategic and annual operating plan adjusted for terminal value assumption these impairment test involve the use of accounting estimate and assumption change in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual result differ from such estimate and assumption to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimate and assumption income tax on recurring basis we ass the need for valuation

business have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup cost for site contamination and are party to lawsuit and claim associated with environmental and safety matter including past production of product containing hazardous substance additional lawsuit claim and cost involving environmental matter are likely to continue to arise in the future with respect to environmental matter involving

appropriate liability for environmental matter honeywell international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount when remedial effort or damage claim payment are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated such liability are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future cost required to complete the remedial work the recorded

enforcement policy the impact of other potentially responsible party technology and information related to individual site we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liability we expect to fund expenditure for these matter from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditure depends on number of factor including the timing of remedial investigation and feasibility study the timing of litigation and settlement of remediation liability personal injury and property damage claim regulatory

upon future completion of study litigation or settlement and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate cost associated with environmental matter can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated result of operation and operating cash flow in the period recognized or paid however considering our past experience and existing reserve we do not expect that

balance are included in the following balance sheet account december other current asset insurance recovery for asbestos related liability accrued liability asbestos related liability narco product honeywell predecessor allied corporation owned narco from to when the narco business wa sold honeywell predecessor entered into cross indemnity agreement with narco which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claim such claim arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos containing refractory brick and mortar for high temperature application narco ceased manufacturing these product in and the first asbestos claim were filed in the tort system against narco in claim filing and related cost increased dramatically in the late through which led to narco filing for bankruptcy in january once narco filed for bankruptcy all then current and future narco asbestos claim were stayed against both narco and honeywell pending the reorganization of narco following the bankruptcy filing in december honeywell recorded total narco asbestos liability of billion which wa comprised of three component the estimated liability to settle pre bankruptcy petition narco claim and certain post petition settlement billion referred to pre bankruptcy narco liability ii the estimated liability related to then unasserted narco claim for the period through million referred to narco trust liability and iii other narco bankruptcy related obligation totaling million when the narco trust liability of million wa established in the methodology for estimating the potential liability wa based primarily on epidemiological projection of the future incidence of disease for the period through fifteen year period historical claim rate in the tort system for the five year period prior to the bankruptcy filing date and anticipated narco trust payment value set forth in the then current draft of the narco trust distribution procedure the methodology required estimating by disease three critical input likely number of claim to be asserted against the narco trust in the future ii percentage of those claim likely to receive payment and iii payment value the company utilized outside asbestos liability valuation specialist honeywell international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount to support our preparation of the narco trust liability estimate which wa based on commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy court addressing trust in when we first established our initial liability narco asbestos claim resolution shifted from the tort system to an anticipated narco trust framework where claim would be processed in accordance with established narco trust distribution procedure including strict medical and exposure criterion for plaintiff to receive compensation we believed at the time that the narco trust claim filing and resolution experience after the narco trust became operational would be significantly different from pre bankruptcy tort system experience in light of these more rigorous claim processing requirement in the narco trust distribution procedure and honeywell active oversight of claim processing and approval given these anticipated difference we believed that year time period wa the appropriate horizon for establishing probable and reasonably estimable liability for then unasserted narco claim it represented our best estimate of the time period it would take for the narco trust to be approved by the bankruptcy court become fully operational and generate sufficiently reliable claim data data set which is statistically representative to enable to update our narco trust liability the narco trust distribution procedure were finalized in and the company updated it narco trust liability to reflect the final term and payment value the original year period from through for unasserted claim did not change asbestos claim filing continued to be stayed against both honeywell and narco the update resulted in range of the estimated liability for unasserted claim of million to million and we believed that no amount within this range wa better estimate than any other amount in accordance with asc contingency asc we recorded the low end of the range of million which resulted in reduction of million in our narco trust liability narco emerged from bankruptcy on april at which time federally authorized trust wa established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future narco asbestos claim both honeywell and narco are protected by permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual action in state or federal court and requiring all asbestos related claim based on exposure to narco asbestos containing product to be made against the narco trust the narco trust agreement and the narco trust distribution procedure are the principal document setting forth the structure of the narco trust these document establish honeywell evergreen funding obligation honeywell is obligated to fund narco asbestos claim submitted to the narco trust which qualify for payment under the trust distribution procedure annual contribution claim subject to an annual cap of million however the initial million of claim processed through the narco trust the initial claim amount will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the initial claim amount will roll over to subsequent year until fully utilized these document also establish the material operating rule for the narco trust including honeywell audit right and the criterion claimant must meet to have valid claim paid these claim payment criterion include providing the narco trust with adequate medical evidence of the claimant asbestos related condition and credible evidence of exposure to specific narco asbestos containing product further the narco trust is eligible to receive cash dividend from harbison walker international inc hwi the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged fully operational from the narco bankruptcy the narco trust is required to use any funding received from hwi to pay annual contribution claim until those fund are exhausted it is only at this point that honeywell funding obligation to the trust is triggered thus there is an unrelated primary source for funding that affect honeywell funding of the narco trust liability once operational the narco trust began to receive process and pay claim that had been previously stayed pending the trust becoming operational the narco trust began to pay claim in we began to assert our on going audit right to review and monitor the claim processor adherence to the established requirement of the narco trust distribution procedure while honeywell international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount so we identified several issue with the way the trust wa implementing the narco trust distribution procedure in honeywell filed suit against the narco trust in bankruptcy court alleging breach of certain provision of the narco trust agreement and narco trust distribution procedure the party agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an month standstill agreement which expired in october notwithstanding it expiration claim processing continues and honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issue that is instance where honeywell belief the narco trust is not processing claim in accordance with established narco trust distribution procedure honeywell reserve the right to seek judicial intervention should negotiation fail after the narco trust became effective in the million narco trust liability wa then comprised of liability for unasserted claim and ii liability for claim asserted after the narco trust became operational but not yet paid although we know the number of claim filed with the narco trust each year we are not able to determine at this time the portion of the narco trust liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claim due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claim data because of the claim processing issue described previously honeywell maintained the million accrual for narco trust liability there ha not been sufficiently reliable claim data history to enable to update that liability of december our total narco asbestos liability of million reflects pre bankruptcy narco liability of million and narco trust liability of million through december pre bankruptcy narco liability ha been reduced by approximately billion since first established in largely related to settlement payment the remaining pre bankruptcy narco liability principally represents estimated amount owed pursuant to settlement agreement reached during the pendency of the narco bankruptcy proceeding that provide for the right to submit claim to the narco trust subject to qualification under the term of the settlement agreement and trust distribution procedure the other narco bankruptcy obligation were paid in and no further liability is recorded of december honeywell ha not made any payment to the narco trust for annual contribution claim annual contribution claim which have been paid since the trust became operational have been funded by cash dividend from hwi honeywell continues to evaluate the appropriateness of the million narco trust liability despite becoming effective in the narco trust ha experienced delay in becoming fully operational violation of the trust distribution procedure and the resulting dispute and challenge standstill pending dispute resolution and limited claim payment have all contributed to the lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claim processing experience in the trust since it became operational result we have not been able to further update the narco trust liability the million narco trust liability continues to be appropriate because of the unresolved pending claim in the trust some portion of which will result in payouts in the future and because new claim continue to be filed with the narco trust when sufficiently reliable claim data exists we will update our estimate of the narco trust liability and it is possible that material change may need to be recognized our insurance receivable of million of december corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted narco asbestos claim reflects coverage which reimburses honeywell for portion of narco related indemnity and defense cost and is provided by large number of insurance policy written by dozen of insurance company in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market we conduct analysis to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claim while the substantial majority of our honeywell international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount insurance carrier are solvent some of our individual carrier are insolvent which ha been considered in our analysis of probable recovery we made judgment concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealing and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issue surrounding insurer bendix product bendix manufactured automotive brake lining that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form claimant consist largely of individual allege exposure to asbestos from brake from either performing or being in the vicinity of individual who performed brake replacement the following table present information regarding bendix related asbestos claim activity claim activity year ended

nonmalignant claim total claim honeywell ha experienced average resolution value per claim excluding legal cost follows year ended december in whole dollar malignant claim nonmalignant claim it is not possible to predict whether resolution value for bendix related asbestos claim will increase decrease or stabilize in the future our consolidated financial statement reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted claim filed of the financial statement date and unasserted bendix related asbestos claim and excludes the company legal fee to defend such asbestos claim which will continue to be expensed by the company they are incurred we have valued bendix asserted and unasserted claim using average resolution value for the previous five year we update the resolution value used to estimate the cost of bendix asserted and unasserted claim during the fourth quarter each year honeywell reflects the inclusion of all year of epidemiological disease projection through when estimating the liability for unasserted bendix related asbestos claim such liability for unasserted bendix related asbestos claim is based on historic and anticipated claim filing experience and dismissal rate disease classification and resolution value in the tort system for the previous five year our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted bendix asbestos claim reflects coverage which is provided by large number of insurance policy written by dozen of insurance company in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statement simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying

impact of any settlement reached with our insurer in conjunction with the garrett spin off the company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with garrett subsidiary pursuant to

divestiture employee benefit plan intellectual property and environmental health and safety matter we recognize liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually ass the likelihood of adverse judgment of outcome in these matter well potential range of possible loss taking into consideration any insurance recovery based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other expert included in these other matter are the following honeywell united auto worker uaw et al in september the uaw and certain honeywell retiree plaintiff filed suit in the eastern district of michigan the district court alleging that series of master collective bargaining agreement mcbas between honeywell and the uaw provided the retiree with right to lifetime vested healthcare benefit that could never be changed or reduced plaintiff alleged that honeywell had violated those vested right by implementing express limitation cap on the amount honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retiree honeywell subsequently answered the uaw complaint and asserted counterclaim including for breach of implied warranty between and honeywell began enforcing the cap against former employee in response the uaw and certain of the plaintiff filed motion seeking ruling that the mcbas do not limit honeywell obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retiree on march the district court issued it opinion resolving all pending summary judgment motion except for honeywell counterclaim for breach of implied warranty which ha since been dismissed without prejudice honeywell international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount in the opinion the district court held that the mcbas do not promise retiree vested lifetime benefit that survive expiration of the mcbas based on this ruling honeywell terminated the retiree healthcare coverage benefit altogether of july in response the uaw filed motion to enjoin honeywell from completely terminating coverage of july arguing that the cap are vested and that honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefit at the capped level on july the district court denied the uaw motion and entered final judgment consistent with it march ruling the uaw ha appealed this decision to the sixth circuit court of appeal honeywell belief the district court ruling will be upheld in the march opinion the district court also held that honeywell is obligated under the mcbas to pay the full premium for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount based on this ruling honeywell would be required to pay monetary damage to retiree for any past year in which honeywell paid le than the full premium of their healthcare coverage such damage would be limited depending on the retiree group to two to three year period ending when the mcba expired and honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent period honeywell ha appealed the district court ruling on this full premium damage issue and belief that the sixth circuit court of appeal will reverse the district court on that issue in the event the sixth circuit were to sustain the district court ruling on this issue honeywell would be liable for damage of at least million given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigation including the specific matter referenced above we do not believe it is possible to develop estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accrual for these matter other than specifically set forth above considering our past experience and existing accrual we do not expect the outcome of these matter either individually or in the aggregate to have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position because most contingency are resolved over long period of time potential liability are subject to change due to new development change in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirement which could cause to pay damage award or settlement or become subject to equitable remedy that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation or operating cash flow in the period recognized or paid warranty and guarantee in the normal course of business we issue product warranty and product performance guarantee we accrue for the estimated cost of product warranty and performance guarantee based on contract term and historical experience at the time of

discount rate actuarial assumption used to determine net periodic benefit cost for year ended december discount rate discount rate wa for through rate wa changed to for the remainder of due to plan remeasurement of the discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan reflects the current rate at which the associated liability could be settled at the measurement date of december to determine discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan we use modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflow of our benefit plan to yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument we use the single weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio discount rate benchmark we utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost component of net periodic pension benefit income for our significant pension plan this approach applies the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flow and provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected cash flow and their corresponding spot rate for our pension plan the single weighted average spot rate used to determine service and interest cost for are and the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligation compared to pension plan obligation honeywell international inc note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount our expected rate of return on plan asset of at december wa down from at december reflecting re balancing of asset to more fixed income during our asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset return over varying long term period combined with current
