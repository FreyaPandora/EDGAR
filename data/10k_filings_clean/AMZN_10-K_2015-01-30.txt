growth rate we base our expense level and investment plan on sale estimate significant portion of our expense and investment is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sale are le than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rate may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the product and service offered by or our seller and our business is affected by general economic and business condition worldwide softening of demand whether caused by change in customer preference or weakening of the or global economy may result in decreased revenue or growth our sale and operating result will also fluctuate for many other reason including due to risk described

operation expose to number of risksour international activity are significant to our revenue and profit and we plan to expand internationally in certain international market segment we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantage or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operation and website and promote our brand internationally our international operation may not be profitable on sustained basis in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international sale and operation are subject to number of risk including local economic and political condition government regulation of commerce and other service electronic device and competition and restrictive governmental action such trade protection measure including export duty and quota and custom duty and tariff nationalization and restriction on foreign ownership restriction on sale or distribution of certain product or service and uncertainty regarding liability for product service and content including uncertainty result of le internet friendly legal system local law lack of legal precedent and varying rule regulation and practice regarding the physical and digital distribution of medium product and enforcement of intellectual property right business licensing or certification requirement such for import export web service and electronic device limitation on the repatriation and investment of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycle and the resultant negative impact on cash flow law and regulation regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payment and restriction on pricing or discount lower level of use of the internet lower level of consumer spending and fewer opportunity for growth compared to the lower level of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation result of distance language and cultural difference of content different employee employer relationship and the existence of work council and labor union compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act and other applicable and foreign law prohibiting corrupt payment to government official and other third party law and policy of the and other jurisdiction affecting trade foreign investment loan and tax and geopolitical event including war and terrorism international commerce and other online and web service grow competition will intensify local company may have substantial competitive advantage of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer well their more established local brand name we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth the people republic of china prc and india regulate amazon and it affiliate business and operation in country through regulation and license requirement that may restrict foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data center retail delivery and other sector ii internet content and iii the sale of medium and other product and service for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirement www amazon cn is operated by prc company that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc national in addition we provide certain technology service in conjunction with third party that hold prc license to provide service in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian company by foreign entity involved in online multi brand retail trading activity for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tool and logistics service to third party seller to enable them to sell online and deliver to customer although we believe these structure and activity comply with existing law they involve unique risk and the prc is actively considering change in it foreign investment rule that could impact these structure and activity are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation of prc and indian law and regulation and it is possible that the government will ultimately take view contrary to in addition our chinese and indian business and operation may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliate are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationship with respect to management and control of such business if our international activity were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other law or regulation or if interpretation of those law and regulation were to change our business in those country could be subject to fine and other financial penalty have license revoked or be forced to shut entirely if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment and data center our business could be harmedif we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment and data center successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased cost impairment charge or or harm our business in other way we continue to add fulfillment warehouse and data center capability or add new business with different requirement our fulfillment and data center network become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively in addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment center will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipment order from several of our website are fulfilled primarily from single location and we have limited ability to reroute order to third party for drop shipping we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service center if the other business on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment service deliver product to our fulfillment center in excess of forecast we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment center we rely on limited number of shipping company to deliver inventory to and completed order to our customer if we are not able to negotiate acceptable term with these company or they experience performance problem or other difficulty it could negatively impact our operating result and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed order to customer also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquake labor dispute act of war or terrorism act of god and similar factor third party either drop ship or otherwise fulfill an increasing portion of our customer order and we are increasingly reliant on the reliability quality and future procurement of their service under some of our commercial agreement we maintain the inventory of other company thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment center our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other company to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected cost and other harm to our business and reputation of contentsthe seasonality of our business place increased strain on our operationswe expect disproportionate amount of our net sale to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular product in sufficient amount such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock product we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment cost which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrade split shipment and additional long zone shipment necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if many customer access our website within short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruption that make our website unavailable or prevent from efficiently fulfilling order which may reduce the volume of good we sell and the attractiveness of our product and service in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment and customer service center during these peak period and delivery and other fulfillment company and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risk described elsewhere in this item relating to fulfillment center optimization and inventory we generally have payment term with our retail vendor that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customer result of holiday sale of december of each year our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance typically reach their highest level other than result of cash flow provided by or used in investing and financing activity this operating cycle result in corresponding increase in account payable of december our account payable balance generally decline during the first three month of the year resulting in corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance our business could suffer if we are

agreement strategic alliance and business relationship under these agreement we provide web service technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other service well enable seller to offer product or service through our website these arrangement are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitment which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the component of these commercial relationship which may include web service fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and third party software and engaging third party to perform service the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreement is partially dependent on the volume of the other company sale therefore if the other company offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationship and strategic alliance on favorable term we also may be subject to claim from business to which we provide these service if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these service our agreement terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreement on comparable term or all we may in the future enter into amendment on le favorable term or encounter party that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligation to which could adversely affect our operating result our present and

political and regulatory risk associated with specific country result of future acquisition or merger we might need to issue additional equity security spend our cash or incur debt contingent liability or amortization expense related to intangible asset any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business in addition valuation supporting our acquisition and strategic investment could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuation have experienced impairment or other than temporary decline in fair value which could adversely impact our financial result we have foreign exchange riskthe result of operation of and certain of our intercompany balance associated with our international website and product and service offering are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuation upon translation operating result may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss on the remeasurement of

may be difficult to establish vendor relationship determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain type of inventory or component may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry broad selection and significant inventory level of certain product such consumer electronics and we may be unable

and interest we could be subject to additional income tax liabilitieswe are subject to income tax in the federal and state and numerous foreign jurisdiction tax law regulation and administrative practice in various jurisdiction may be subject to significant change due to economic political and other condition and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and

and operating expense will be lower than if currency had remained constant we believe that our increasing diversification beyond the economy through our growing international business benefit our shareholder over the long term we also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating result and growth rate before and after the effect of currency change in addition the remeasurement of our

of the united state gaap requires estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note the sec ha defined company critical accounting policy the one that are most important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and result of operation and which require the company to make it most difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policy and judgment addressed below we also have other key accounting policy which involve the use of estimate judgment and assumption that are significant to understanding our result for additional information see item of part ii financial statement and supplementary data note description of business and accounting policy although we believe that our estimate assumption and judgment are reasonable they are based upon information presently available actual result may differ significantly from these estimate under different assumption judgment or condition _______________________ the operating cycle is the number of day of sale in inventory plus the number of day of sale in account receivable minus account payable day inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sale to average inventory over five quarter end account payable day calculated the quotient of account payable to current quarter cost of sale multiplied by the number of day in the current quarter of contentsinventoriesinventories consisting of product available for sale are primarily accounted for using the first in first out fifo method and are valued at the lower of cost or market value this valuation requires to make judgment based on currently available information about the likely method of disposition such through sale to individual customer return to product vendor or liquidation and expected recoverable value of each disposition category these assumption about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material write down in the future measure of sensitivity for every of additional inventory valuation allowance of december we would have recorded an additional cost of sale of approximately million in addition we enter into supplier commitment for certain electronic device component these commitment are based on forecasted customer demand if we reduce these commitment we may incur additional cost goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstance change that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable our annual testing date is october we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net asset to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value is determined to be le than the book value or qualitative factor indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flow forecast of future cash flow are based on our best estimate of future net sale and operating expense based primarily on expected category expansion pricing market segment share and general economic condition certain estimate of discounted cash flow involve business and geography with limited financial history and developing revenue model change in these forecast could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded if any during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumption used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the period presented no triggering event were identified that required an interim impairment test measure of sensitivity decrease in the fair value of any of our reporting unit of december would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill financial and credit market volatility directly impact our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization during time of volatility significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price change are short term in nature or longer term trend we have not made any significant change to the accounting methodology used to evaluate goodwill impairment change in our estimated future cash flow and asset fair value may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future measure of sensitivity prolonged decrease from our december closing stock price would not be an indicator of possible impairment stock based compensationwe measure compensation cost for stock award at fair value and recognize it compensation expense over the service period for award expected to vest the fair value of restricted stock unit is determined based on the number of share granted and the quoted price of our common stock the estimated number of stock award that will ultimately vest requires judgment and to the extent actual result or updated estimate differ from our current estimate such amount will be recorded cumulative adjustment in the period estimate are revised we consider many factor when estimating expected forfeiture including employee classification economic environment and historical experience we update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly we have not made any significant change to the accounting methodology used to evaluate stock based compensation change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material change in stock based compensation expense in the future measure of sensitivity change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately million impact on our operating income our estimated forfeiture rate of december and wa we utilize the accelerated method rather than the straight line method for recognizing compensation expense for example over of the compensation cost related to an award vesting ratably over four year is expensed in the first year if forfeited early in the life of an award the compensation expense adjustment is much greater under an accelerated method than under straight line method income taxeswe are subject to income tax

luxembourg may be required to ass and we may be required to pay additional amount with respect to current and prior period and our tax in the future could increase although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable the final outcome of tax audit investigation and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provision and accrual development in an audit

income or loss for example the impact of discrete item and non deductible expense on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower we recorded provision for income tax of million million and million in and our provision for income tax in wa higher than in primarily due to the increased loss in certain foreign subsidiary for which we may not realize tax benefit and audit
