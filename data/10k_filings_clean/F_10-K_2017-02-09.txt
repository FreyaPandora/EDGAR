retail customer and to authorized part distributor which in turn primarily sell these product to retailer we also offer extended service contract the worldwide automotive industry is affected significantly by general economic condition which we have little control vehicle are durable good and consumer have latitude in determining whether and to replace an existing vehicle the decision whether to purchase vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth geopolitical event and other factor including the cost of purchasing and operating car and truck and the availability and cost of financing and fuel we have seen in the united state and europe in particular the number of car and truck sold may vary substantially from year to year the automotive industry is highly competitive business that ha wide and growing variety of product offering from growing number of manufacturer our wholesale unit volume vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand our wholesale unit volume also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory our share is influenced by our product are perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturer based on many factor including price quality styling reliability safety fuel efficiency functionality and reputation our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introduction our ability to satisfy changing consumer preference with respect to type or size of vehicle well design and performance characteristic affect our sale and earnings significantly business continued with other manufacturer the profitability of our business is affected by many factor including wholesale unit volume margin of profit on each vehicle sold which in turn is affected by many factor such market factor volume and mix of vehicle and option sold and net pricing reflecting among other factor incentive program cost of component and raw material necessary for production of vehicle cost for customer warranty claim and additional service action cost for safety emission and fuel economy technology and equipment high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost that small change in wholesale unit volume can significantly affect overall profitabilityour industry ha competitive pricing environment driven in part by industry excess capacity which is concentrated in europe and asia but affect other market much of this capacity can be redirected to other market the decline in the value of the yen during the past four year also ha contributed significantly to competitive pressure in many of our market for the past several decade manufacturer typically have given price discount and other marketing incentive to maintain market share and production level discussion of our strategy to compete in this pricing environment is set forth in the overview section in item competitive position the worldwide automotive industry consists of many producer with no

facility in separate agreement with fce ford credit also ha agreed to maintain fce net worth in excess of million no payment have been made pursuant to that agreement business continued governmental standardsmany governmental standard and regulation relating to safety fuel economy emission control noise control vehicle recycling substance of concern vehicle damage and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicle engine and equipment manufactured for sale in the united state europe and elsewhere in addition manufacturing and other automotive assembly facility in the united state europe and elsewhere are subject to stringent standard regulating air emission water discharge and the handling and disposal of hazardous substance the most significant of the standard and regulation affecting are discussed below vehicle emission controlu requirement federal and california emission standard the federal clean air act imposes stringent limit on the amount of regulated pollutant that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicle and engine produced for sale in the united state in the environmental protection agency epa finalized new tier regulation that phase in increasingly stringent motor vehicle emission standard beginning with the model year pursuant to the clean air act california may establish it own vehicle emission standard which can be adopted by other state the california air resource board carb ha adopted lev iii standard which took effect with the model year and impose increasingly stringent tailpipe and evaporative emission requirement for light and medium duty vehicle thirteen state primarily located in the northeast and northwest have adopted the lev iii standard compliance with the tier and lev iii standard could be challenging both federal and california regulation require motor vehicle to be equipped with on board diagnostic obd system that monitor emission related system and component obd requirement become more complex and challenging over time could lead to increased vehicle recall and warranty cost compliance with automobile emission standard depends in part on the widespread availability of high quality and consistent automotive fuel that the vehicle were designed to use fuel variable that can affect vehicle emission include ethanol content octane rating and the use of metallic based fuel additive among other thing there are various ongoing regulatory and judicial proceeding related to fuel quality at the national and state level and the outcome of these proceeding could affect vehicle manufacturer warranty cost well their ability to comply with vehicle emission standard the california vehicle emission program also includes requirement for manufacturer to produce and deliver for sale zero emission vehicle zevs the current zev regulation mandate substantial annual increase in the production and sale of battery electric fuel cell and plug in hybrid vehicle particularly for the model year by the model year approximately of manufacturer total california sale volume will need to be made of such vehicle compliance with zev rule could have substantial adverse effect on our sale volume and profit we are concerned that the market and infrastructure in california may not support the large volume of advanced technology vehicle that manufacturer will be required to produce especially if gasoline price remain relatively low we also are concerned about enforcement of the zev mandate in other state that have adopted california zev program where the existence of market for such vehicle is even le certain carb conduct periodic review of it upcoming zev requirement taking into account factor such technology development and market acceptance ford and the industry will be active participant in such review with the goal of ensuring that zev requirement are feasible and not excessively burdensome european requirement european union eu directive and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutant that may be emitted by new motor vehicle and engine sold in the eu stringent new stage emission standard took effect for vehicle registration starting in september with second phase beginning in september these standard will drive the need for additional diesel exhaust after treatment which will add cost and potentially impact the diesel advantage the european commission ha also proposed new real driving emission rde rule which will require manufacturer to conduct on road emission test using portable emission analyzer these on road emission test will complement the laboratory based test during the initial phase which started in january the rde test are used for monitoring purpose beginning in september manufacturer will have to reduce the divergence the regulatory limit that is tested in laboratory condition and the value of rde test conformity factor the additional cost associated with conducting the rde test and complying with the conformity factor are expected to be significant europe is in process of drafting the rde in use surveillance rule with proposal to allow third party to conduct testing and to define process to challenge the product compliance with authority on longer term approach the wvta whole vehicle type approval regulation are adapted to cover market surveillance which is further expected to increase testing by authority across europe from business continued other national requirement many country in an effort to address air quality concern are adopting previous version of european or united nation economic commission for europe un ece mobile source emission regulation some country have adopted more advanced regulation based on the most recent version of european or regulation for example china adopted emission regulation based on european stage vi emission standard and evaporative emission and on board diagnostic requirement korea and taiwan have adopted very stringent based standard for gasoline vehicle and european based standard for diesel vehicle although these country have adopted regulation based on un ece or standard there may be some unique testing provision that require emission control system to be redesigned for these market canadian criterion emission regulation are aligned with tier requirement in july the canadian federal government amended the on road vehicle and engine emission regulation and the sulphur in gasoline regulation to align canadian emission standard with the tier regulation discussed in october the canadian province of quebec passed legislation enabling regulation of zev mandate regulation are still under development but quebec ha signaled that they plan to follow california and northeast state regulation not all country have adopted appropriate fuel quality standard to accompany the stringent emission standard adopted this could lead to compliance problem particularly if on board diagnostic or in use surveillance requirement are implemented brazil and chile have introduced stringent emission and on board diagnostic standard based on the european stage standard for light duty vehicle and stage standard for heavy duty vehicle in brazil all light duty vehicle are required to meet based proconve standard and more stringent on board diagnostic standard for diesel light duty vehicle were introduced in argentina is phasing in european stage standard for all new light duty vehicle registration by and european stage standard for heavy duty vehicle by global development since september the epa and carb have pursued enforcement action major competitor in connection with it use of defeat device in hundred of thousand of light duty diesel vehicle these action have resulted in settlement involving billion of dollar for environmental remediation and civil penalty well indictment of several employee on charge of committing federal crime the competitor continues to face various class action suit well numerous claim and investigation by various state and other nation defeat device are element of design typically embedded in software that improperly cause the emission control system to function le effectively during normal on road driving than during an official laboratory emission test without justification they are prohibited by law in many jurisdiction including the united state and europe we do not use defeat device in our vehicle the investigation by epa and carb of our competitor have led to increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulator around the world epa began carrying additional non standard test part of it vehicle certification program following an announcement in september the eu accelerated effort to finalize it rde testing program described above in several european country including france and germany conducted non standard emission test and published the result in some case this supplemental testing ha triggered investigation of other manufacturer for possible defeat device testing is expected to continue on an ongoing basis vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standardsu requirement light duty vehicle federal law requires that light duty vehicle meet minimum corporate average fuel economy cafe standard set by the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa manufacturer are subject to substantial civil penalty if they fail to meet the cafe standard in any model year after taking into account all available credit for the preceding three model year and expected credit for the five succeeding model year the law requires nhtsa to promulgate and enforce separate cafe standard applicable to each manufacturer fleet of domestic passenger car imported passenger car and light duty truck epa also regulates vehicle greenhouse gas ghg emission under the clean air act because the vast majority of ghgs emitted by vehicle are the result of fuel combustion ghg emission standard effectively are fuel economy standard thus it is necessary for nhtsa and epa to coordinate with each other on their fuel economy and ghg standard respectively to avoid potential inconsistency in epa and nhtsa jointly promulgated regulation establishing the one national program of cafe and ghg regulation for light duty vehicle for the model year in epa and nhtsa jointly promulgated regulation extending the one national program framework through the model year these rule require business continued manufacturer to achieve across the industry light duty fleet average fuel economy of approximately mpg by the model year mpg by the model year and mpg by the model year each manufacturer specific task depends on the mix of vehicle it sell the rule include the opportunity for manufacturer to earn credit for technology that achieve real world reduction and fuel economy improvement that are not captured by the epa fuel economy test procedure manufacturer also can earn credit for ghg reduction not specifically tied to fuel economy such improvement in air conditioning system the one national program standard become increasingly stringent over time and they will be difficult to meet if fuel price remain relatively low and market condition do not drive consumer to purchase electric vehicle and other highly fuel efficient vehicle in large number we are concerned about the commercial feasibility of meeting future model year ghg and cafe standard particularly the standard because of the many unknown regarding technology development market condition and other factor so far into the future the one national program rule provided for midterm evaluation process under which by april epa and nhtsa would evaluate their standard for model year in order to ensure that those standard are feasible and optimal in light of intervening event shortly president obama left office in january epa announced an accelerated decision to maintain the ghg standard originally set for those model year nhtsa is continuing to conduct it evaluation with respect to the model year standard it remains to be seen whether the epa determination will be reconsidered under president trump administration and whether the epa and nhtsa determination will ultimately be harmonized with each other if the agency seek to impose and enforce fuel economy and ghg standard that are misaligned with market condition we likely would be forced to take various action that could have substantial adverse effect on our sale volume and profit such action likely would include restricting offering of selected engine and popular option increasing market support program for our most fuel efficient car and light truck and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicle such high performance car utility and or full size light truck in order to maintain compliance california ha asserted the right to regulate motor vehicle ghg emission and other state have asserted the right to adopt the california standard with the adoption of the federal one national program standard discussed above california and the other state have agreed that compliance with the federal program would satisfy compliance with any purported state ghg requirement for the model year this avoids patchwork of potentially conflicting federal and state ghg standard should california and other state ever renew their effort to enforce state specific motor vehicle ghg rule this would impose significant cost on automotive manufacturer requirement heavy duty vehicle epa and nhtsa have jointly promulgated ghg and fuel economy standard on heavy duty vehicle generally vehicle over pound gross vehicle weight rating in our case the standard primarily affect our heavy duty pickup truck and van plus vocational vehicle such shuttle bus and delivery truck in epa and nhtsa finalized ghg and fuel economy standard for these vehicle covering model year the heavy duty standard increase in stringency it may become more difficult to comply continuing to offer full lineup of heavy duty truck european requirement in december the eu approved regulation of passenger car emission beginning in that limit the industry fleet average to maximum of gram per kilometer km using sliding scale based on vehicle weight this regulation provides different target for each manufacturer based on the respective average vehicle weight for it fleet of vehicle limited credit are available for cycle action eco innovation certain alternative fuel and vehicle with emission below km penalty system will apply for manufacturer failing to meet target pooling agreement between different manufacturer are possible although it is not clear that these will be of much practical benefit under the regulation starting in an industry target of km ha been set for which of manufacturer fleet ha to comply by of manufacturer fleet ha to comply other non eu european country are likely to follow with similar regulation for example switzerland ha introduced similar rule which began phasing in starting in july with the target which include target of km with condition still to be defined although the industry average emission target is significantly higher we face the risk of advance premium payment requirement if for example unexpected market fluctuation within quarter negatively impact our average fleet performance in separate legislation complementary measure have been mandated including requirement related to fuel economy indicator and more efficient low mobile air conditioning system the eu commission council and parliament have approved target for commercial light duty vehicle to be at an industry average of km with phase in from and km in it is likely that other european country will implement similar rule business continued but under even more difficult condition for instance switzerland will implement the same km target in but under more difficult condition this regulation also provides different target for each manufacturer based on it respective average vehicle weight in it fleet of vehicle the final mass and requirement for multi stage vehicle our transit chassis cab are fully allocated to the base manufacturer ford so that the base manufacturer is fully responsible for the performance of the final up fitted vehicle the eu proposal also includes penalty system super credit for vehicle below km and limited credit for off cycle eco innovation pooling etc similar to the passenger car regulation the united nation developed new technical regulation for passenger car emission and this new world light duty test procedure wltp is focused primarily on better aligning laboratory and fuel consumption figure with customer reported figure the introduction of wltp in europe is likely to require update to labeling early and will increase certain consumer label value thereby impacting tax in country with tax scheme cost associated with new or incremental testing for wltp could be significant the european commission requires mandatory wltp testing for regulated emission and starting in september the european commission ha assured comparable stringency to the existing fleet average rule for each automobile manufacturer if the fleet average target are required to be measured on wltp instead of under the current european new european driving cycle nedc requirement the legislative framework and process for the target translation is currently under development the european commission confirmed in october that there would be delay in the introduction of timetable for post proposal the proposal is expected to be released during the second half of some european country have implemented or are considering other initiative for reducing vehicle emission including fiscal measure and labeling for example the united kingdom france germany spain portugal and the netherlands among others have introduced taxation based on emission the eu requirement are likely to trigger further measure to limit ghg emission the eu directive on mobile air conditioning currently requires the replacement of the current refrigerant with lower global warming potential refrigerant for new vehicle type and for all newly registered vehicle starting in january refrigerant change add considerable cost along the whole manufacturing chain other national requirement the canadian federal government ha regulated vehicle ghg emission under the canadian environmental protection act beginning with the model year in october the canadian federal government published the final change to the regulation for light duty vehicle which maintain alignment with epa vehicle ghg standard for the model year the final regulation for heavy duty vehicle wa published in february in october the canadian federal government published the notice of intent to regulate heavy duty vehicle and engine for model year and beyond which track epa standard mexico adopted fuel economy standard based on the one national program framework that took effect in many asia pacific country such australia china india south korea taiwan and vietnam are developing or enforcing fuel efficiency or labeling target for example south korea ha set fuel efficiency target for with incentive for early adoption china published standard for stage iv fuel efficiency target for the fuel efficiency target will impact the cost of vehicle technology in the future in south america brazil introduced voluntary vehicle energy efficiency labeling program indicating fuel consumption rate for all light duty vehicle brazil ha required inclusion of emission classification on fuel economy label since january brazil also published new automotive regime establishing minimum absolute cafe value function of fleet corporate average mass for light duty vehicle with spark ignition engine in order to qualify for industrialized product tax reduction additional tax reduction are available if further fuel efficiency improvement are achieved severe penalty system will apply to qualified manufacturer failing to meet fuel efficiency requirement for the sale period brazil reduced import tax on electric and hybrid car the tax rate which wa will vary from zero to depending on vehicle energy efficiency discussion on new fuel efficiency requirement ha started chile introduced tax based on urban fuel consumption and nox emission for light and medium vehicle beginning in late in general fuel efficiency target may impact the cost of technology of our model in the future in the middle east the kingdom of saudi arabia introduced new light duty vehicle fuel economy standard which are patterned after the cafe standard structure with fuel economy target following the design of the fuel economy standard the standard became effective on january and will be fully phased in by the end of business continued vehicle safetyu requirement the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the safety act regulates vehicle and vehicle equipment in two primary way first the safety act prohibits the sale in the united state of any new vehicle or equipment that doe not conform to applicable vehicle safety standard established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding many safety standard is costly in part because the standard tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emission and fuel economy standard second the safety act requires that defect related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaign manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicle if it determines the vehicle do not comply with safety standard should we or nhtsa determine that either safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicle the cost of such recall campaign could be substantial other national requirement the eu and many country have established vehicle safety standard and regulation and are likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirement in the future the european general safety regulation introduced united nation economic commission for europe un ece regulation which will be required for the european type approval process eu regulator also are focusing on active safety feature such lane departure warning system electronic stability control and automatic brake assist globally government generally have been adopting un ece based regulation with minor variation to address local concern any difference between north american and un ece based regulation can add complexity and cost to the development of global platform vehicle and we continue to support effort to harmonize regulation to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing common level of safety performance several recently launched bilateral negotiation on free trade can potentially contribute to this goal new safety and recall requirement in china india and gulf cooperation council country also may add substantial cost and complexity to our global recall practice in south america additional safety requirement are being introduced or proposed in argentina brazil chile colombia ecuador and uruguay influenced by the new car assessment program for latin america and the caribbean latin ncap which may be driver for similar action in other country in canada regulatory requirement are currently aligned with regulation however recent amendment to the canadian motor vehicle safety act have introduced broad power to the minister of transport to order manufacturer to submit notice of defect or non compliance when the minister considers it would be in the interest of safety new car assessment program organization around the globe rate and compare motor vehicle in new car assessment program ncaps to provide consumer with additional information about the safety of new vehicle ncaps use crash test and other evaluation that are different than is required by applicable regulation and use star to rate vehicle safety with five star awarded for the highest rating and one for the lowest achieving high ncap rating can add complexity and cost to vehicle employment datathe approximate number of individual employed by and entity that we consolidated of december and wa follows in thousand north east service

occurrence the most significant risk factor applicable to decline in industry sale volume particularly in the united state europe or china due to financial crisis recession geopolitical event or other factor because we like other manufacturer have high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost relatively small change in industry sale volume can have substantial effect on our cash flow and profitability if industry vehicle sale were to decline to level significantly below our planning assumption particularly in the united state europe or china due to financial crisis recession geopolitical event or other factor the decline could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation and cash flow for discussion of economic trend see the overview section of item lower than anticipated market acceptance of ford new or existing product or service or failure to achieve expected growth although we conduct extensive market research before launching new or refreshed vehicle and introducing new service many factor both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing product and service in the marketplace offering vehicle and service that customer want and value can mitigate the risk of increasing price competition and declining demand but product and service that are perceived to be le desirable whether in term of price quality styling safety overall value fuel efficiency or other attribute can exacerbate these risk with increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet social medium and other medium mere allegation relating to quality safety fuel efficiency corporate social responsibility or other key attribute can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our product or service even where such allegation prove to be inaccurate or unfounded further our ability to successfully grow through investment in the area of emerging opportunity depends on many factor including advancement in technology regulatory change and other factor that are difficult to predict that may significantly affect the future of electrification autonomy and mobility market shift away from sale of larger more profitable vehicle beyond ford current planning assumption particularly in the united state shift in consumer preference away from larger more profitable vehicle at level beyond our current planning assumption whether because of spiking fuel price decline in the construction industry government action or incentive or other reason could result in an immediate and substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation continued or increased price competition resulting from industry excess capacity currency fluctuation or other factor the global automotive industry is intensely competitive with manufacturing capacity far exceeding current demand according to the december report issued by ihs automotive the global automotive industry is estimated to have had excess capacity of about million unit in industry overcapacity ha resulted in many manufacturer offering marketing incentive on vehicle in an attempt to maintain and grow market share these incentive historically have included combination of subsidized financing or leasing program price rebate and other incentive result we are not necessarily able to set our price to offset higher cost of marketing incentive commodity or other cost increase or the impact of adverse currency fluctuation including pricing advantage foreign competitor may have because of their weaker home market currency continuation of or increased excess capacity could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation risk factor continued fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate resource intensive manufacturing operation we are exposed to variety of market and asset risk including the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate we monitor and manage these exposure an integral part of our overall risk management program which recognizes the unpredictability of market and seek to reduce potentially adverse effect on our business nevertheless change in currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate can not always be predicted or hedged in addition because of intense price competition and our high level of fixed cost we may not be able to address such change even if foreseeable result substantial unfavorable change in foreign currency exchange rate commodity price

regarding the overall stability of the european union given the diverse economic and political circumstance of individual european currency area euro area country these concern have been exacerbated by brexit which among other thing ha resulted in weaker sterling versus dollar and euro we have sterling revenue exposure and euro cost exposure sustained weakening of sterling against euro may have an adverse effect on our profitability further the united kingdom may be at risk of losing access to free trade agreement for good and service with the european union and other country which may result in increased tariff on import and export that could have an adverse effect on our profitability fce bank plc fce our subsidiary is bank authorized by the government to carry on range of regulated activity within the united kingdom and through branch network in other european country through passporting system which allows it to establish or provide it service in the without further authorization requirement if passporting arrangement cease to be effective result of brexit fce could be required to reconsider it structure or seek additional authorization to continue to do business in the which may be time consuming and costly the economic and policy uncertainty on going in the euro area highlight potential longer term risk regarding it sustainability this uncertainty could cause financial and capital market within and outside europe to constrict thereby negatively impacting our ability to finance our business or if country within the euro area were to default on it debt or withdraw from the euro currency or in more extreme circumstance the euro currency were to be dissolved entirely the impact on market around the world and on ford global business could be immediate and significant in addition we have operation in various market with volatile economic or political environment and are pursuing growth opportunity in number of newly developed and emerging market these investment may expose to heightened risk of economic geopolitical or other event including governmental takeover nationalization of our manufacturing facility or intellectual property restrictive exchange or import control disruption of operation result of systemic political or economic instability outbreak of war or expansion of hostility and act of terrorism each of which could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation further the government other government and international organization could impose additional sanction that could restrict from business directly or indirectly in or with certain country or party which could include affiliate work stoppage at ford or supplier facility or other limitation on production whether result of labor dispute natural or man made disaster tight credit market or other financial distress production constraint or difficulty or other factor work stoppage or other limitation on production

collective bargaining agreement or result of supplier financial distress or other production constraint or difficulty or for other reason work stoppage or other limitation on production at ford or supplier facility for any reason including but not limited to labor dispute natural or man made disaster tight credit market or other financial distress or production constraint or difficulty could have substantial adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation risk factor continued single source supply of component or material many component used in our vehicle are available only from single supplier and can not be re sourced quickly or inexpensively to another supplier due to long lead time new contractual commitment that may be required by another supplier before ramping up to provide the component or material etc in addition to the general risk described above regarding interruption of supply which are exacerbated in the case of single source supplier the exclusive supplier of key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price quality warranty claim or other term relating to component labor or other constraint on ford ability to maintain competitive cost structure substantially all of the hourly employee in our automotive operation in the united state and canada are represented by union and covered by collective bargaining agreement these agreement provide guaranteed wage and benefit level throughout the contract term and some degree of income security subject to certain condition practical matter these agreement may

postretirement liability impairing liquidity or financial condition we have defined benefit retirement plan in the united state that cover many of our hourly and salaried employee we also provide pension benefit to non employee and retiree primarily in europe in addition we and certain of our subsidiary sponsor plan to provide other postretirement benefit opeb for retired employee primarily health care and life insurance benefit see note of the note to the financial statement for more information about these plan these benefit plan impose significant liability on and could require to make additional cash contribution which could impair our liquidity if our cash flow and capital resource were insufficient to meet any pension or opeb obligation we could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditure suspend dividend payment seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness worse than assumed economic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement benefit plan discount rate or investment return the measurement of our obligation cost and liability associated with benefit pursuant to our pension and other postretirement benefit plan requires that we estimate the present value of projected future payment to all participant we use many assumption in calculating these estimate including assumption related to discount rate investment return on designated plan asset and demographic experience mortality and retirement rate we generally remeasure these estimate at each year end and recognize any gain or loss associated with change to our plan asset and liability in the year incurred to the extent actual result are le favorable than our assumption we may recognize substantial remeasurement loss in our result for discussion of our assumption see critical accounting estimate in item and note of the note to the financial statement restriction on use of tax attribute from tax law ownership change section of the internal revenue code restricts the ability of corporation that undergoes an ownership change to use it tax attribute including net operating loss and tax credit tax attribute for these purpose an ownership change occurs if percent shareholder of an issuer outstanding common stock collectively increase their ownership percentage by more than percentage point over rolling three year

risk of an ownership change under section under the plan share held by any person who acquires without the approval of our board of director beneficial ownership of or more of our outstanding common stock could be subject to significant dilution our shareholder approved the renewal at our annual meeting in may risk factor continued the discovery of defect in vehicle resulting in delay in new model launch recall campaign or increased warranty cost government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy defect related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaign and manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicle if it determines that the vehicle do not comply with safety standard nhtsa enforcement strategy ha shifted to significant increase in civil penalty levied and the use of consent order requiring direct oversight by nhtsa of certain manufacturer safety process trend that could continue should we or government safety regulator determine that safety or other defect or noncompliance exists with respect to certain of our vehicle prior to the start of production the launch of such vehicle could be delayed such defect is remedied the cost associated with any protracted delay in new model launch necessary to remedy such defect or the cost of recall campaign or warranty cost to remedy such defect in vehicle that have been sold could be substantial such recall and customer satisfaction action may relate to defective component we receive from supplier the cost to complete recall or customer satisfaction action could be exacerbated to the extent such action relates to global platform furthermore launch delay or recall action could adversely affect our reputation or market acceptance of our product discussed above under lower than anticipated market acceptance of ford new or existing product or service or failure to achieve expected growth increased safety emission fuel economy or other regulation resulting in higher cost cash expenditure and or sale restriction the worldwide automotive industry is governed by substantial amount of government regulation which often differs by state region and country government regulation ha arisen and proposal for additional regulation are advanced primarily out of concern for the environment including concern about the possibility of global climate change and it impact vehicle safety and energy independence for example discussed above under item business governmental standard in the united state the cafe standard for light duty vehicle increase sharply to mpg by the model year epa parallel emission regulation impose similar standard california zev rule also mandate steep increase in the sale of electric vehicle and other advanced technology vehicle beginning in the model year in addition many government regulate local product content and or impose import requirement mean of creating job protecting domestic producer and influencing the balance of payment in recent year we have made significant change to our product cycle plan to improve the overall fuel economy of vehicle we produce thereby reducing their ghg emission there are limit on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvement over given time frame however primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technology consumer acceptance of new technology and change in vehicle mix willingness of consumer to absorb the additional cost of new technology the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technology for use in particular vehicle the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technology and the human engineering and financial resource necessary to deploy new technology across wide range of product and powertrains in short time the current fuel economy and zev standard will be difficult to meet if fuel price remain relatively low and market condition do not drive consumer to purchase electric vehicle and other highly fuel efficient vehicle in large number the government ha pursued an enforcement action against major competitor in connection with it alleged use of defeat device in hundred of thousand of light duty diesel vehicle collecting billion of dollar for environmental remediation project and civil penalty several of the competitor employee have been indicted on charge of committing federal crime the competitor also face various class action suit well numerous claim and investigation by various state and other nation the emergence of this issue ha led to increased scrutiny of automaker emission testing by regulator around the world which in turn ha triggered investigation of other manufacturer these event may lead to new regulation more stringent enforcement program request for field action and or delay in regulatory approval the cost to comply with existing government regulation is substantial and additional regulation or change in consumer preference that affect vehicle mix could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation for more discussion of the impact of such standard on our global business see the governmental standard discussion in item business above in addition number of government well non governmental organization publicly ass vehicle to their own protocol the protocol could change aggressively and any negative perception regarding the performance of our vehicle subjected to such test could reduce future sale risk factor continued unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defect in product perceived environmental impact or otherwise we spend substantial resource ensuring that we comply with governmental safety regulation mobile and stationary source emission regulation and other standard compliance with governmental standard however doe not necessarily prevent individual or class action which can entail significant cost and risk in certain circumstance court may permit tort claim even where our vehicle comply with federal and or other applicable law furthermore simply responding to actual or threatened litigation or government investigation of our compliance with regulatory standard whether related to our product or business or commercial relationship may require significant expenditure of time and other resource litigation also is inherently uncertain and we could experience significant adverse result in addition adverse publicity surrounding an allegation may cause significant reputational harm that could have significant adverse effect on our sale adverse effect on result from decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentive related to investment we receive economic benefit from national state and local government in various region of the world in the form of incentive designed to encourage manufacturer to establish maintain or increase investment workforce or production these incentive may take various form including grant loan subsidy and tax abatement or credit the impact of these incentive can be significant in particular market during reporting period for example most of our manufacturing facility in south america are located in brazil where the state or federal government have historically offered and continue to offer significant incentive to manufacturer to encourage capital investment increase manufacturing production and create job result the performance of our south american operation ha been impacted favorably by government incentive to substantial extent in brazil however the federal government ha levied assessment against concerning our calculation of federal incentive we received and certain state have challenged the grant to of tax incentive by the state of bahia including constitutional challenge of state incentive that is pending in brazil supreme court decrease in expiration without renewal of or other cessation or clawback of government incentive for any of our business unit result of administrative decision or otherwise could have substantial adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation see note of the note to

litigation failure of financial institution to fulfill commitment under committed credit and liquidity facility under our corporate credit facility we are able to borrow repay and then re borrow up to billion certain of our subsidiary have standby or revolving credit facility on which they depend for liquidity if the financial institution that provide commitment under the corporate credit facility our subsidiary standby or revolving credit facility or other committed credit facility were to default on their obligation to fund the commitment these facility would not be available to which could substantially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition for discussion of our credit agreement see liquidity and capital resource in item and note of the note to the financial statement risk factor continued inability of ford credit to access debt securitization or derivative market around the world at competitive rate or in sufficient amount due to credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption regulatory requirement or other factor ford credit ability to obtain unsecured funding at reasonable cost is dependent on it credit rating or it perceived creditworthiness ford credit ability to obtain securitized funding under it committed asset backed liquidity program and certain other asset backed securitization transaction is subject to sufficient amount of asset eligible for these program well ford credit ability to obtain appropriate credit rating and for certain committed program derivative to manage the interest rate risk over time and particularly in the event of any credit rating downgrade market volatility market disruption or other factor ford credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchase or originates because of funding constraint in addition ford credit may be limited in the amount of receivables it purchase or originates in certain country or region if the local capital market particularly in developing country do not exist or are not adequately developed similarly ford credit may reduce the amount of receivables it purchase or originates if there is significant decline in the demand for the type of security it offer or ford credit is unable to obtain derivative to manage the interest rate risk associated with it securitization transaction significant reduction in the amount of receivables ford credit purchase or originates would significantly reduce it ongoing profit and could adversely affect it ability to support the sale of ford vehicle higher than expected credit loss lower than anticipated residual value or higher than expected return volume for leased vehicle credit risk is the possibility of loss from customer or dealer failure to make payment according to contract term credit risk which is heavily dependent upon economic factor including unemployment consumer debt service burden personal income growth dealer profitability and used car price ha significant impact on ford credit business the level of credit loss ford credit may experience could exceed it expectation and adversely affect it financial condition and result of operation in addition ford credit project expected residual value including residual value support payment from ford and return volume for the vehicle it lease actual proceeds realized by ford credit upon the sale of returned leased vehicle at lease termination may be lower than the amount projected which would reduce the profitability of the lease transaction among the factor that can affect the value of returned lease vehicle are the volume of vehicle returned economic condition and quality or perceived quality safety fuel efficiency or reliability of the vehicle actual return volume may be higher than expected and can be influenced by contractual lease end value relative to auction value marketing program for new vehicle and general economic condition each of these factor alone or in combination ha the potential to adversely affect ford credit profitability if actual result were to differ significantly from ford credit projection see critical accounting estimate in item for additional discussion increased competition from bank financial institution or other third party seeking to increase their share of financing ford vehicle no single company is dominant force in the automotive finance industry most of ford credit competitor in the united state use credit aggregation system that permit dealer to send through standardized system retail credit application to multiple finance source to evaluate financing option offered by these source also direct on line or large dealer group financing option provide consumer with alternative finance source and or increased pricing transparency all of these financing alternative drive greater competition based on financing rate and term competition from such institution and alternative finance source could adversely affect ford credit profitability and the volume of it retail business in addition ford credit may face increased competition on wholesale financing for ford dealer new or increased credit regulation consumer or data protection regulation or other regulation resulting in higher cost and or additional financing restriction finance company ford credit is highly regulated by governmental authority in the location in which it operates which can impose significant additional cost and or restriction on it business in the united state for example ford credit operation are subject to regulation supervision and licensing under various federal state and local law and regulation including the federal truth in lending act consumer leasing act equal credit opportunity act and fair credit reporting act the dodd frank act directs federal agency to adopt rule to regulate the consumer finance industry and the capital market and give the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb broad rule making and enforcement authority for wide range of consumer financial protection law that regulate consumer finance business such ford credit retail automotive financing business exercise of these power by the cfpb may increase the cost of impose additional restriction on or otherwise adversely affect company in the automotive finance business the cfpb ha authority to supervise and examine the largest nonbank automotive finance company such ford credit for compliance with consumer financial protection law risk factor continued in some country outside the united state some of ford credit subsidiary are regulated banking institution and are required among other thing to maintain minimum capital and liquidity in many other location governmental authority require company to have license in order to conduct financing business compliance with these law and regulation imposes additional cost on ford credit and affect the conduct of it business additional regulation could add significant cost or operational constraint that might impair ford credit

the outcome of individual matter is not predictable with assurance see note of the note to the financial statement for discussion of loss contingency following is discussion of our significant pending legal proceeding product liability matterswe are defendant in numerous action in state and federal court within and outside of the united state alleging damage from injury resulting from or aggravated by alleged defect in our vehicle in many no monetary amount of damage is specified or the specific amount alleged is the jurisdictional minimum our experience with litigation alleging specific amount of damage suggests that such amount on average bear little relation to the actual amount of damage if any that we will pay in resolving such matter in addition to pending action we ass the likelihood of incident that likely have occurred but not yet been reported to we also take into consideration specific matter that have been raised claim but have not yet proceeded to litigation individual product liability matter which if resolved unfavorably to the company likely would involve significant cost would be described herein currently there are no such matter to report asbestos matter asbestos wa used in some brake clutch and other automotive component from the early along with other vehicle manufacturer we have been the target of asbestos litigation and result are defendant in various action for injury claimed to have resulted from alleged exposure to ford part and other product containing asbestos plaintiff in these personal injury case allege various health problem result of asbestos exposure either from component part found in older vehicle insulation or other asbestos product in our facility or asbestos aboard our former maritime fleet we believe that we are being targeted more aggressively in asbestos suit because many previously targeted company have filed for bankruptcy or emerged from bankruptcy relieved of liability for such claim most of the asbestos litigation we face involves individual who claim to have worked on the brake of our vehicle we are prepared to defend these case and believe that the scientific evidence confirms our long standing position that there is no increased risk of asbestos related disease result of exposure to the type of asbestos formerly used in the brake on our vehicle the extent of our financial exposure to asbestos litigation remains very difficult to estimate and could include both compensatory and punitive damage award the majority of our asbestos case do not specify dollar amount for damage in many of the other case the dollar amount specified is the jurisdictional minimum and the vast majority of these case involve multiple defendant sometimes more than one hundred many of these case also involve multiple plaintiff and often we are unable to tell from the pleading which plaintiff are making claim against opposed to other defendant annual payout and defense cost may become significant in the future environmental matter we have received notice under various federal and state environmental law that we along with others are or may be potentially responsible party for the cost associated with remediating numerous hazardous substance storage recycling or disposal site in many state and in some instance for natural resource damage we also may have been generator of hazardous substance at number of other site the amount of any such cost or damage for which we may be held responsible could be significant we have two environmental legal proceeding to which governmental authority is party and in which we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanction in excess of notice of violation to ford chicago assembly plant and dearborn truck plant on august the environmental protection agency epa issued notice of violation to our chicago assembly plant and on december epa issued notice of violation to our dearborn truck plant epa alleges that the plant violated several requirement related to their air permit monetary sanction if any have not yet been determined legal proceeding continued class action in light of the fact that very few of the purported class action filed against in the past have ever been certified by the court class action in general we list those action that have been certified class action by court of competent jurisdiction and any additional purported class action that raise allegation substantially similar to an existing and certified class and ii likely would involve significant cost if resolved unfavorably to the company at this time we have no such purported class action filed against other mattersbrazilian tax matter two brazilian state and the brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax assessment against ford brazil related to state and federal tax incentive ford brazil receives for it operation in the brazilian state of bahia all assessment have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction for each assessment if we do not prevail at the administrative level we plan to appeal to the relevant state or federal judicial court which would likely require to post significant collateral in order to proceed our appeal with one state and the federal tax authority remain at the administrative level in the other state where three case are pending one remains at the administrative level and two have been appealed to the judicial court to date we have not been required to post any collateral transit connect custom ruling

difference in duty rate for prior import our protest of the ruling within cbp wa denied and we filed challenge in the court of international trade cit decision by cit may be appealed to the court of

net investment in operating lease measure of ford credit total net receivables excluding unearned interest supplement and residual support allowance for credit loss and other primarily accumulated supplemental depreciation the measure is useful to management and investor it closely approximates the customer outstanding balance on the receivables which is the basis for earning revenue ford credit managed leverage most comparable gaap measure financial statement leverage ford credit debt to equity ratio adjusted to exclude cash cash equivalent and marketable security other than amount related to insurance activity and ii for derivative accounting the measure is useful to investor because it reflects the way ford credit manages it business cash cash equivalent and marketable security are deducted because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support operation and on balance sheet securitization transaction derivative accounting adjustment are made to asset debt and equity position to reflect the impact of interest rate instrument used with ford credit term debt issuance and securitization transaction ford credit generally repays it debt obligation they mature so the interim effect of change in market interest rate are excluded in the calculation of managed leverage management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued revenueour automotive segment revenue is generated primarily by sale of vehicle part and accessory we generally treat sale and marketing incentive reduction to revenue revenue is recorded when all risk and reward of ownership are transferred to our customer generally our dealer and distributor for the majority of sale this occurs when product are shipped from our manufacturing facility this is not the case however with respect to vehicle produced for sale to daily rental car company that are subject to guaranteed repurchase option these vehicle are accounted for operating lease with lease revenue and profit recognized over the term of the lease proceeds from the sale of vehicle at auction are recognized in revenue at the time of sale most of the vehicle sold by to our dealer and distributor are financed at wholesale by ford credit upon ford credit originating the wholesale receivable related to dealer purchase of vehicle ford credit pay cash to the relevant automotive legal entity in payment of the dealer obligation for the purchase price of the vehicle the dealer then pay the wholesale finance receivable to ford credit when it sell the vehicle to retail customer our financial service segment revenue is generated primarily from interest on finance receivables net of certain deferred origination cost that are included reduction of financing revenue and such revenue is recognized over the term of the receivable using the interest method also revenue from operating lease is recognized on straight line basis over the term of the lease income is generated to the extent revenue exceed expense most of which are interest depreciation and operating expense transaction between our automotive and financial service segment occur in the ordinary course of business for example we offer special retail financing and lease incentive to dealer customer who choose to finance or lease our vehicle from ford credit the estimated cost for these incentive is recorded revenue reduction to automotive sale at the later of the date the related vehicle sale to our dealer are recorded or the date the incentive program is both approved and communicated in order to compensate ford credit for the lower interest or lease rate offered to the retail customer we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to ford credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract with the dealer customer ford credit recognizes the amount over the life of retail finance contract an element of financing revenue and over the life of lease contract reduction to depreciation see note of the note to the financial statement for more detailed discussion of transaction between our automotive and financial service segment cost and expensesour income statement classifies our automotive segment total cost and expense into two category cost of sale and ii selling administrative and other expense we include within cost of sale those cost related to the development manufacture and distribution of our vehicle part and accessory specifically we include in cost of sale each of the following material cost including commodity cost freight cost warranty including product recall and customer satisfaction program cost labor and other cost related to the development and manufacture of our product depreciation and amortization and other associated cost we include within selling administrative and other expense labor and other cost not directly related to the development and manufacture of our product including such expense advertising and sale promotion cost certain of our cost such material cost generally vary directly with change in volume and mix of production in our industry production volume often varies significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year quarterly production volume experience seasonal shift throughout the year including peak retail sale season and the impact on production of model changeover and new product launch we have seen in recent year annual production volume are heavily impacted by external economic factor including the pace of economic growth and factor such the availability of consumer credit and cost of fuel result we analyze the profit impact of certain cost change holding constant present year volume and mix and currency exchange in order to evaluate our cost trend absent the impact of varying production and currency exchange level we analyze these cost change in the following category contribution cost these cost typically vary with production volume these cost include material commodity warranty and freight and duty cost structural cost these cost typically do not have directly proportionate relationship to production volume these cost include manufacturing engineering spending related advertising and sale promotion administrative and selling and pension and opeb cost management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued while contribution cost generally vary directly in proportion to production volume element within our structural cost category are impacted to differing degree by change in production volume we also have varying degree of discretion when it come to controlling the different element within our structural cost for example depreciation and amortization expense largely is associated with prior capital spending decision on the other hand while labor cost do not vary directly with production volume manufacturing labor cost may be impacted by change in volume for example when we increase overtime add production shift or add personnel to support volume increase other structural cost such advertising or engineering cost do not necessarily have directly proportionate relationship to production volume our structural cost generally are within our discretion although to varying degree and can be adjusted over time in response to external factor we consider certain structural cost to be direct investment in future growth and revenue for example increase in structural cost are necessary to grow our business and improve profitability we expand around the world invest in new product and technology respond to increasing industry sale volume and grow our market share cost of sale and selling administrative and other expense for full year were billion our automotive segment material and commodity cost make up the largest portion of these cost and expense representing in about two third of the total amount structural cost are the largest piece of the remaining balance although material cost are our largest absolute cost our margin can be affected significantly by change in any category of cost key economic factor and trend affecting the automotive industrycurrency exchange rate volatility the federal reserve raised it policy interest rate in december move which ha been accompanied by an upward shift in longer term interest rate since november the related shift in capital flow have contributed to downward pressure on both developed and emerging market currency globally in some emerging market that pressure is aggravated by low commodity price high inflation or unstable policy environment additionally the yen euro and pound have depreciated result of monetary policy easing by the central bank in those market well ongoing brexit negotiation in europe the weak yen in particular add significant potential downward pressure on vehicle pricing across many market globally in most market exchange rate are market determined and all are impacted by many different macroeconomic and policy factor and thus likely to remain volatile however in some market exchange rate are heavily influenced or controlled by government excess capacity according to ihs automotive an automotive research firm the estimated automotive industry global production capacity for light vehicle of about million unit exceeded global production by about million unit in in north america and europe two region where significant share of industry revenue is earned excess capacity percent of production wa an estimated and respectively in in china the auto industry also witnessed excess capacity at of production in manufacturer compete to capitalize on china future market potential according to production capacity data projected by ihs automotive global excess capacity condition could continue for several year at an average of about million unit per year during the period from to pricing pressure excess capacity coupled with proliferation of new product being introduced in key segment will keep pressure on manufacturer ability to increase price in north america the industry restructuring of the past few year ha allowed manufacturer to better match production with demand although japanese and korean manufacturer also have capacity located outside of the region directed to north america in the future chinese and indian manufacturer are expected to enter and european market further intensifying competition over the long term intense competition and excess capacity will continue to put downward pressure on inflation adjusted price for similarly contented vehicle in the united state and contribute to challenging pricing environment for the automotive industry in europe the excess capacity situation wa exacerbated by weakening demand and the lack of reduction in existing capacity such that negative pricing pressure is expected to continue for the foreseeable future commodity and energy price change the price of oil ha increased since late oil producing nation agreed to modest output reduction although the average oil price for the year wa below the level other commodity price have begun to increase well with continued volatility likely over the longer term commodity price are likely to trend higher given expectation for global demand growth management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued vehicle profitability our financial result depend on the profitability of the vehicle we sell which may vary significantly by vehicle line in general larger vehicle tend to command higher price and be more profitable than smaller vehicle both across and within vehicle segment for example in north america our larger more profitablevehicles had an average contribution margin that wa about of our total average contribution margin across allvehicles whereas our smaller vehicle had significantly lower contribution margin in addition government regulation aimed at reducing emission and increasing fuel efficiency may increase the cost of vehicle by more than the perceived benefit to the consumer given the backdrop of excess capacity these regulation could dampen contribution margin trade policy to the extent government in various region erect or intensify barrier to import or implement currency policy that advantage local exporter selling into the global marketplace there can be significant negative impact on manufacturer based in market that promote free trade while we believe the long term trend is toward the growth of free trade we have noted with concern recent development in number of region in asia pacific for example the recent dramatic depreciation of the yen significantly reduces the cost of export into the united state europe and other global market by japanese manufacturer over period of time the emerging weakness of the yen can contribute to other country pursuing weak currency policy by intervening in the exchange rate market this is particularly likely in other asian country such south korea another example government action in south america to incentivize local production and balance trade are driving trade friction between south american country and also with mexico resulting in business environment instability and new trade barrier we will continue to monitor and address developing issue around trade policy other economic factor during mature market government bond yield and inflation were lower than expected although in recent month interest rate have risen and deflation risk have receded somewhat this is occurring against backdrop of loose monetary policy particularly in europe and japan at the same time government deficit and debt remain at high level in many major market the eventual implication of higher government deficit and debt with potentially higher long term interest rate may drive higher cost of capital over our planning period higher interest rate and or tax to address the higher deficit also may impede real growth in gross domestic product and therefore vehicle sale over our planning period for additional information on our assessment of the business environment refer to the outlook section below management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued trend and strategy in we updated

record performance in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued shown above are the factor that contributed to the million decline in full year automotive segment pre tax profit the lower profit wa more than explained by higher warranty cost including about million for the door latch recall we announced in the third quarter of market factor

management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued north america full year pre tax profit wa million lower than year ago driven by unfavorable stock change and higher recall cost the unfavorable stock change reflect decrease in dealer stock this year compared to increase year ago when we were building stock after the kansa city plant launch it also reflects action to align production to demand for several vehicle the higher product cost reflect primarily the impact of our first major refresh of the super duty the non repeat of last year one time ratification bonus related to the uaw agreement wa partial offset within the united state average retail transaction price were per vehicle higher compared to year ago more than double the industry average increase our incentive were up percent of revenue but le than the industry average for we expect our north america operating margin and profit to be strong but lower than in mainly due to unfavorable volume and mix and increased investment in emerging opportunity management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued all full year key metric were

wa driven by favorable mix reflecting increasing demand for our higher trim series across all major vehicle line and improved cost performance reflecting our continued focus on material cost reduction improved result in russia also contributed to europe favorable year over year profit improvement for we expect europe to remain profitable although at level below due mainly to weaker sterling resulting from brexit and higher cost associated with continued investment in the business including the launch of fiesta and ecosport net pricing is expected to be partial offset we also expect continued improvement from our business in russia management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued middle east africa operating margin and pre tax result

analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued asia pacific full year profit wa million down million from reflecting lower net pricing adverse exchange effect mainly weaker chinese renminbi and unfavorable cost performance lower net pricing compared to year ago reflects continued negative pricing trend in china unfavorable cost performance wa driven by cost increase to support higher volume and continued investment for future product and regulatory action the investment in structural cost were offset partially by our continued focus on material cost efficiency volume and mix were up reflecting higher industry volume in china and improved mix from new product launch for we expect asia pacific profit to improve due to favorable volume and mix this will be offset in part by lower net pricing which will be lower due to continued negative china industry pricing and unfavorable exchange mainly the chinese renminbi management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued financial service segmentin general we measure year over year change in ford credit pre tax result using the causal factor listed below volume and mix volume primarily measure change in net financing margin driven by change in average managed receivables at prior period financing margin yield defined below in financing margin at prior period exchange rate volume change are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicle sale and lease the extent to which ford credit purchase retail installment sale and lease contract the extent to which ford credit provides wholesale financing the sale price of the vehicle financed the level of dealer inventory ford sponsored special financing program available exclusively through ford credit and the availability of cost effective funding for the purchase of retail installment sale and lease contract and to provide wholesale financing mix primarily measure change in net financing margin driven by period over period change in the composition of ford credit average managed receivables by product and by country or region financing margin financing margin variance is the period to period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average managed receivables at prior period exchange rate this calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated financing margin yield equal revenue le interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period divided by average managed receivables for the same period financing margin change are driven by change in revenue and interest expense change in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rate cost assumption in pricing mix of business and competitive environment change in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rate borrowing spread and asset liability management credit loss credit loss is the change in the provision for credit loss at prior period exchange rate for analysis purpose management split the provision for credit loss into net charge offs and the change in the allowance for credit loss net charge off change are primarily driven by the number of repossession severity per repossession and recovery change in the allowance for credit loss are primarily driven by change in historical trend in credit loss and recovery change in the composition and size of ford credit present portfolio change in trend in historical used vehicle value and change in economic condition for additional information on the allowance for credit loss refer to the critical accounting estimate allowance for credit loss section below lease residual lease residual measure change to residual performance at prior period exchange rate for analysis purpose management split residual performance primarily into residual gain and loss and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation residual gain and loss change are primarily driven by the number of vehicle returned to ford credit and sold and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation of the vehicle sold change in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by change in ford credit estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and change in the estimate of the number of vehicle that will be returned to it and sold for additional information on accumulated supplemental depreciation refer to the critical accounting estimate accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease section below exchange reflects change in pre tax result driven by the effect of converting functional currency income to dollar other primarily includes operating expense other revenue and insurance expense at prior period exchange rate change in operating expense are primarily driven by salaried personnel cost facility cost and cost associated with the origination and servicing of customer contract in general other revenue change are primarily driven by change in earnings related to market valuation adjustment to derivative primarily related to movement in interest rate and other miscellaneous management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued ford credit receivables were higher than year ago in line with expectation and while full year pre tax profit wa lower it remained solid at billion portfolio performance remained robust despite higher ltrs origination servicing and collection practice remained disciplined and consistent management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued ford credit lower full year pre tax profit is primarily explained by unfavorable lease residual performance and credit loss favorable volume and mix driven by growth in consumer and non consumer finance receivables globally and operating lease in north america wa partial offset lease residual performance primarily reflects higher depreciation in north america we expect lower auction value in the future credit loss performance primarily reflects higher charge offs in north america for we continue to expect ford credit full year pre tax profit to be about billion which is lower compared with due to the impact of increased accumulated depreciation driven by expected lower residual value for ford credit lease portfolio in north america management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued over the last several year we have seen industry lease share grow result the supply of off lease vehicle is higher and will continue to grow for the next several year the increased supply of used vehicle is resulting in lower auction value and we expect this trend to continue ford credit off lease vehicle auction performance reflects industry trend in ford credit off lease auction value were lower than primarily reflecting higher return volume and lower auction value on smaller vehicle ford credit full year lease share wa flat compared with and remains below the industry reflecting the parameter of our leasing strategy which focus on supporting sale protecting residual value and managing the trade cycle industry off lease volume is expected to continue to grow ford credit continues to plan for lower auction value the average placement term and average fico score have remained stable for several year reflecting ford credit disciplined and consistent underwriting practice

believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resource to continue to invest in new product and service that customer want and value transform and grow our business pay our debt and obligation and when they come due pay sustainable dividend and provide protection within an uncertain global economic environment our key balance sheet metric include total cash cash equivalent and marketable security collectively automotive cash automotive liquidity which includes automotive cash and total available committed credit line and cash net of debt at december we had billion of automotive cash of which about wa held by consolidated entity domiciled in the united state we target to have an average ongoing automotive cash balance of about billion we expect to have period when we will be above or below this amount due to future cash flow expectation such for pension contribution debt maturity capital investment investment in emerging opportunity or restructuring requirement ii short term timing difference and iii change in the global economic environment our automotive cash investment primarily include department of treasury obligation federal agency security bank time deposit with investment grade institution corporate investment grade security commercial paper rated or higher and debt obligation of select group of non government non governmental agency and supranational institution the average maturity of these investment is approximately one year and is adjusted based on market condition and liquidity need we monitor our automotive cash level and average maturity on daily basis management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued in addition to our target automotive cash balance we also target to maintain corporate credit facility for our automotive business of about billion to protect against exogenous shock our corporate credit facility is discussed below we ass the appropriate long term target for total automotive liquidity comprised of automotive cash and the corporate credit facility to be about billion which is an amount we believe is sufficient to support our business priority and to protect our business at december we had billion of automotive liquidity our automotive cash and automotive liquidity target could be reduced over time based on improved operating performance and change in our risk profile change in automotive cash change in automotive segment cash are summarized below in billion in managing our automotive business we classify change in automotive cash into operating and other item operating item include automotive segment pre tax profit capital spending depreciation and tooling amortization change in working capital and all other and timing difference non operating item include separation payment transaction with other segment acquisition and divestiture change in automotive debt contribution to funded pension plan and dividend paid to shareholder automotive operating cash flow wa billion in more than explained by automotive segment pre tax profit automotive total cash flow of billion in includes billion in proceeds from our unsecured debt issuance in the united state capital spending wa billion in and is projected to be about billion in based on expected cash flow and the identification of additional opportunity for profitable growth the ongoing amount of capital spending to support product development growth restructuring and infrastructure is expected to be between billion and billion per year through management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued with respect to change in working capital in general we carry relatively low automotive segment trade receivables compared with our trade payable because the majority of our automotive wholesale are financed primarily by ford credit immediately upon sale of vehicle to dealer which generally occurs at the time the vehicle are gate released shortly after being produced in addition our inventory are lean because we build to order not for inventory in contrast our automotive trade payable are based primarily on industry standard production supplier payment term generally ranging between day to day result our cash flow tends to improve wholesale volume increase but can deteriorate significantly when wholesale volume drop sharply these working capital balance generally are subject to seasonal change that can impact cash flow for example we typically experience cash flow timing difference associated with inventory and payable due to our annual summer and december shutdown period when production and therefore inventory and wholesale volume are usually at their lowest level while payable continue to come due and be paid the net impact of this typically result in cash outflow from change in our working capital balance during these shutdown period available credit line total committed automotive credit line at december were billion consisting of billion of our corporate credit facility and billion of local credit facility available to non automotive affiliate at december the amount available under the corporate credit facility wa about billion with about million utilized for letter of credit at december the amount available under local credit facility wa about million with about billion utilized lender under our corporate credit facility have commitment to totaling billion with of the commitment maturing on april and of the commitment maturing on april we have allocated billion of commitment to ford credit on an irrevocable and exclusive basis to support it growth and liquidity any borrowing by ford credit under the corporate credit facility would be guaranteed by the corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change condition to borrowing restrictive financial covenant for example interest or fixed charge coverage ratio debt to equity ratio and minimum net worth requirement and credit rating trigger that could limit our ability to obtain funding the corporate credit facility contains liquidity covenant that requires to maintain minimum of billion in aggregate of domestic cash cash equivalent and loaned and marketable security and or availability under the facility if our senior unsecured long term debt doe not maintain at least two investment grade rating from fitch moody and each defined under credit rating below the guarantee of certain subsidiary will be required debt total automotive debt at december wa billion which is about billion higher than at december the increase primarily reflects our unsecured debt issuance in the united state local funding in international market and foreign currency exchange offset partially by debt repayment including

ford credit liquidity profile continues to be diverse robust and focused on maintaining liquidity level that meet it business and funding requirement ford credit annually stress test it balance sheet and liquidity to ensure that it continues to meet it financial obligation through economic cycle funding source ford credit funding source include primarily unsecured debt and securitization transaction including other structured financing ford credit issue both short term and long term debt that is held by both institutional and retail investor with long term debt having an original

receivable growth and timing of funding transaction ford credit target liquidity of at least billion at december ford credit liquidity available for use wa billion billion higher than year end ford credit source of liquidity include cash committed asset backed facility unsecured credit facility and the corporate credit facility allocation ford credit balance sheet is inherently liquid because of the short term nature of it finance receivables investment in operating lease and cash ford credit ensures it cumulative debt maturity have longer tenor than it cumulative asset maturity this positive maturity profile is intended to provide ford credit with additional liquidity after all of it asset have been funded management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued leverage ford credit us leverage or the debt to equity ratio to make various business decision including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing and assessing it capital structure the chart below show the calculation of ford credit financial statement leverage and managed leverage ford credit belief that managed leverage is useful to it investor because it reflects the way ford credit manages it business ford credit deducts cash cash equivalent and marketable security excluding amount related to insurance activity because they generally correspond to excess debt beyond the amount required to support it operation and amount to support on balance sheet securitization transaction ford credit make derivative accounting adjustment to it asset debt and equity position to reflect the impact of interest rate instrument ford credit us in connection with it term debt issuance and securitization transaction the derivative accounting adjustment related to these instrument vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligation based on change in market interest rate ford credit generally repays it debt obligation they mature result ford credit excludes the impact of these derivative accounting adjustment on both the numerator and denominator in order to exclude the interim effect of change in market interest rate ford credit plan it managed leverage by considering prevailing market condition and the risk characteristic of it business at december ford credit financial statement leverage wa and managed leverage wa ford credit target managed leverage in the range of to managed leverage is above the targeted range reflecting growth in receivables and the continued impact of strong dollar but it continues to trend toward the target range management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued total companypension plan contribution and strategy our strategy is to reduce the risk of our funded defined benefit pension plan including minimizing the volatility of the value of our pension asset relative to pension liability and the need for unplanned use of capital resource to fund the plan the strategy reduces balance sheet cash flow and income exposure and in turn reduces our risk profile the key element of this strategy include limiting liability growth in our defined benefit plan by closing participation to new participant reducing plan deficit through discretionary cash contribution progressively re balancing asset to more fixed income investment with target asset allocation of about fixed income investment and growth asset which will provide better matching of plan asset to the characteristic of the liability thereby reducing our net exposure and taking other strategic action to reduce pension liability worldwide our defined benefit pension plan were underfunded by billion at december deterioration of million from

to contribute billion from automotive cash to our global funded pension plan most of which are mandatory contribution we also expect to make about million of benefit payment to participant in unfunded plan for combined total of billion based on current assumption and regulation we do not expect to have legal requirement to fund our major plan in after we expect contribution to our global funded

an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires to make assumption about matter that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate wa made and change in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimate that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have material impact on our financial condition or result of operation management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director in addition there are other item within our financial statement that require estimation but are not deemed critical defined above change in estimate used in these and other item could have material impact on our financial statement warranty and field service actionsnature of estimate required we provide warranty on the product we sell separately we also periodically perform field service action related to safety recall emission recall and other product campaign pursuant to these warranty and field service action we will repair replace or adjust all part on vehicle that are defective in factory supplied material or workmanship we accrue the estimated cost of both basic warranty coverage and field service action at the time of sale assumption and approach used we establish estimate for warranty and field service action obligation using patterned estimation model we use historical information regarding the nature frequency and average cost of claim for each vehicle line by model year we reevaluate our estimate of warranty and field service obligation on regular basis experience ha shown that initial data for any given model year may be volatile therefore our process relies on long term historical average until sufficient data are available actual experience becomes available we use the data to modify the historical average in order to ensure that the estimate is within the range of likely outcome we then compare the resulting accrual with present spending rate to ensure that the balance are adequate to meet expected future obligation based on this data we revise our estimate necessary warranty coverage vary therefore our warranty accrual vary depending upon the type of product and the geographic location of it sale for specific period of time and or mileage field service action are distinguishable from warranty in that they may occur in period beyond the basic warranty coverage period our best estimate of the obligation related to field service action includes expected future payment due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these factor change in our assumption could materially affect our financial condition and result of operation see note of the note to the financial statement for information regarding warranty and product recall related cost pension and other postretirement employee benefit nature of estimate required the estimation of our defined benefit pension and opeb plan obligation and expense requires that we make use of estimate of the present value of the projected future payment to all participant taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future event such demographic experience and health care cost increase plan obligation and expense are based on existing retirement plan provision no assumption is made regarding any potential future change to benefit provision beyond those to which we are presently committed in existing labor contract assumption and approach used the assumption used in developing the required estimate include the following key factor discount rate our discount rate assumption is based primarily on the result of cash flow matching analysis which match the future cash outflow for each major plan to yield curve based on high quality bond specific to the country of the plan benefit payment are discounted at the rate on the curve to determine the year end obligation beginning in we changed the approach used to estimate the service and interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and opeb for plan that utilize yield curve approach with this refinement we measure service and interest cost by applying the specific spot rate along that yield curve to the relevant projected cash flow for each component we believe this approach provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost this refinement ha no effect on the measurement of our plan obligation or on full year pension and opeb expense lower service and interest cost recorded quarterly are offset in the fourth quarter remeasurement we have accounted for this change in accounting estimate and accordingly have accounted for it on prospective basis management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued expected long term rate of return on plan asset our expected long term rate of return considers various source primarily input from range of advisor for capital market return inflation bond yield and other variable adjusted for specific aspect of our investment strategy by plan historical return also are considered where appropriate the assumption is based on consideration of all input with focus on long term trend to avoid short term market influence salary growth our salary growth assumption reflects our actual experience long term outlook and assumed inflation inflation our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicator including real gross domestic product growth and central bank inflation target expected contribution our expected amount and timing of contribution are based on an assessment of minimum requirement cash availability and other consideration funded status avoidance of regulatory premium and levy and tax efficiency retirement rate retirement rate are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience mortality rate mortality rate are developed to reflect actual and projected plan experience health care cost trend our health care cost trend assumption are developed based on historical cost data the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trend assumption are set at each year end and are generally not changed during the year unless there is major plan event such significant curtailment or settlement that would trigger plan remeasurement see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding pension and opeb cost and assumption pension planseffect of actual result the year end weighted average discount rate wa for plan and for non plan reflecting decrease of and basis point respectively compared with year end in the actual return on asset wa which wa higher than the expected long term rate of return of non actual return on asset wa which wa higher than the expected long term rate of return of in total these difference in addition to demographic and other update resulted in net loss of billion which ha been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported special item for the expected long term rate of return on asset is for plan unchanged from and for non plan down basis point compared with year ago primarily reflecting lower consensus on capital market return expectation from advisor de risking strategy we employ broad global de risking strategy which increase the matching characteristic of our asset relative to our obligation funded status improves change in interest rate which directly influence change in discount rate in addition to other factor have significant impact on the value of our pension obligation and fixed income asset portfolio we de risk our plan and increase the allocation to fixed income investment over time we expect the funded status sensitivity to change in interest rate will be significantly reduced change in interest rate should result in offsetting effect in the value of our pension obligation and the value of the fixed income asset portfolio management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued sensitivity analysis the december pension funded status and expense are affected by year end assumption sensitivity to these assumption may be asymmetric and are specific to the time period noted the effect of change in the factor which generally have the largest impact on year end funded status and pension expense are discussed below discount rate and interest rate have the largest impact on our obligation and fixed income asset the table below estimate the impact on our funded status of an increase decrease in discount rate and interest rate in million basis increase decrease in point december funded statusfactor change plan non plansdiscount rate obligation bps interest rate fixed income asset impact on funded status the fixed income asset sensitivity shown excludes other fixed income return component change in credit spread bond coupon and active management excess return and growth asset return other factor that impact net funded status contribution are not reflected interest rate and the expected long term rate of return on asset have the largest impact on pension expense these assumption are generally set at each year end for expense recorded throughout the following year the table below estimate the impact on pension expense of higher lower assumption for these factor in million basis increase decrease in point expensefactor change plan non plansinterest rate service cost and interest cost bps expected long term rate of return on asset impact of changing multiple factor simultaneously can not be calculated by combining the individual sensitivity the sensitivity of pension expense to an increase in discount rate assumption may not be linear other postretirement employee benefitseffect of actual result the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation for worldwide opeb plan at december wa compared with at december resulting in worldwide loss of about million which ha been recognized within net periodic benefit cost and reported special item sensitivity analysis discount rate and interest rate have the largest impact on our opeb obligation and expense the table below estimate the impact on pension expense of higher lower assumption for these factor in million worldwide opeb basis increase decrease ye obligation increase decrease expense point factor change discount rate obligation bps ainterest rate service cost and interest cost income taxesnature of estimate required we must make estimate and apply judgment in determining the provision for income tax for financial reporting purpose we make these estimate and judgment primarily in the following area the calculation of tax credit ii the calculation of difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose that will ultimately be reported in tax return well iii the calculation of interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position change in these estimate and judgment may result in material increase or decrease to our tax provision which would be recorded in the period in which the change occurs management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued assumption and approach used we are subject to the income tax law and regulation of the many jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law and regulation are complex and involve uncertainty in the application to our fact and circumstance that may be open to interpretation we recognize benefit for these uncertain tax position based upon process that requires judgment regarding the technical application of the law regulation and various related judicial opinion if in our judgment it is more likely than not that the uncertain tax position will be settled favorably to we estimate an amount that ultimately will be realized this process is inherently subjective since it requires our assessment of the probability of future outcome we evaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis including consideration of change in fact and circumstance such new regulation or recent judicial opinion well the status of audit activity by taxing authority change to our estimate of the amount to be realized are recorded in our provision for income tax during the period in which the change occurred we must also ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset against future source of taxable income gaap requires reduction of the carrying amount of deferred tax asset by recording valuation allowance if based on all available evidence it is more likely than not defined likelihood of more than that all or portion of such asset will not be realized we presently believe that valuation allowance of million is required primarily related to deferred tax asset in various non operation we believe that we ultimately will recover the remaining billion of deferred tax asset we have assessed recoverability of these asset and concluded that no valuation allowance is required for additional information regarding income tax see note of the note to the financial statement allowance for credit lossesthe allowance for credit loss represents ford credit estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating lease of the balance sheet date the adequacy of ford credit allowance for credit loss is assessed quarterly and the assumption and model used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly because credit loss can vary substantially over time estimating credit loss requires number of assumption about matter that are uncertain see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding allowance for credit loss nature of estimate required ford credit estimate the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables and operating lease based on several factor consumer portfolio ford credit estimate the allowance for credit loss on consumer receivables and on operating lease using combination of measurement model and management judgment the model consider factor such historical trend in credit loss and recovery including key metric such delinquency repossession and bankruptcy the composition of ford credit present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and new used vehicle trend in historical used vehicle value and economic condition estimate from these model rely on historical information and may not fully reflect loss inherent in the present portfolio therefore ford credit may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable change in recent economic trend and condition portfolio composition and other relevant factor assumption used ford credit allowance for credit loss is based on assumption regarding frequency the number of finance receivables and operating lease contract that are expected to default over the loss emergence period measured repossession repossession ratio reflects the number of finance receivables and operating lease contract that we expect will default over period of time divided by the average number of contract outstanding and loss severity the expected difference between the amount customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received net of expense from selling the repossessed vehicle collective allowance for credit loss the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using collective loss to receivables ltr model that based on historical experience indicates credit loss have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular account that are uncollectible can not be specifically identified the ltr model is based on the most recent year of history each ltr is calculated by dividing credit loss by average finance receivables or average operating lease excluding unearned interest supplement and allowance for credit loss an average ltr is calculated for each product and multiplied by the end of period balance for that given product management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued ford credit largest market also use loss projection model to estimate loss inherent in the portfolio the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metric stratified by contract type retail or lease contract term month and risk rating to ford credit active portfolio to estimate the loss that have been incurred the loss emergence period lep is an assumption within ford credit model and represents the average amount of time between when loss event first occurs to when it is charged off this time period start when the consumer begin to experience financial difficulty it is evidenced typically through delinquency before eventually resulting in charge off the lep is multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit loss for account greater than day past due the uncollectible portion is charged off such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral le cost to sell specific allowance for impaired receivables consumer receivables involved in troubled debt restructurings are specifically assessed for impairment specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the contract original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if ford credit management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment sensitivity analysis change in the assumption used to derive frequency and severity would affect the allowance for credit loss the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumption for ford credit ford and lincoln brand retail financing and operating lease portfolio is follows in million except for percentage assumption change increase decrease frequency repossession ratio pct pt loss severity per unit non consumer portfolio ford credit estimate the allowance for credit loss for non consumer receivables based on historical ltr ratio expected future cash flow and the fair value of collateral collective allowance for credit loss ford credit estimate an allowance for non consumer receivables that are not specifically identified impaired using ltr model for each financing product based on historical experience this ltr is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables ltr approach all account that are specifically identified impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non specific or collective allowance specific allowance for impaired receivables dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loan by the risk characteristic of the loan such the amount of the loan the nature of the collateral and the financial status of the debtor the loan are analyzed to determine whether individual loan are impaired and specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the loan original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if ford credit management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment change in ford credit assumption affect the financial service interest operating and other expense on our income statement and the allowance for credit loss contained within financial service finance receivables net and net investment in operating lease on our balance sheet management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating leasesaccumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease reduces the value of the leased vehicle in ford credit operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their expected residual value at the end of the lease term ford credit monitor residual value each month and it review the adequacy of accumulated depreciation on quarterly basis if ford credit belief that the expected residual value for it vehicle have changed it revise depreciation to ensure that net investment in operating lease equal to the acquisition value of the vehicle le accumulated depreciation will be adjusted to reflect ford credit revised estimate of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term such adjustment to depreciation expense would result in change in the depreciation rate of the vehicle subject to operating lease and are recorded prospectively on straight line basis each lease customer ha the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer nature of estimate required each operating lease in ford credit portfolio represents vehicle it owns that ha been leased to customer at the time ford credit purchase lease it establishes an expected residual value for the vehicle ford credit estimate the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction value return volume for it leased vehicle industrywide used vehicle price marketing incentive plan and vehicle quality data assumption used ford credit accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease is based on assumption regarding auction value ford credit projection of the market value of the vehicle when sold at the end of the lease and return volume ford credit projection of the number of vehicle that will be returned at lease end see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding accumulated depreciation on vehicle subject to operating lease sensitivity analysis for returned vehicle ford credit face risk that the amount it obtains from the vehicle sold at auction will be le than it estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumption for ford credit ford and lincoln brand operating lease portfolio is follows in million except for percentage assumption percentagechange increase decrease future auction value volume the impact of the change in assumption on future auction value and return volume would increase or decrease accumulated supplemental depreciation and depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating lease adjustment to the amount of accumulated supplemental depreciation on operating lease would be reflected on our balance sheet net investment in operating lease and on the income statement in financial service interest operating and other expense management discussion and analysis

effective january management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation continued aggregate contractual obligationswe are party to many contractual obligation involving commitment to make payment to third party most of these are debt obligation incurred by our financial service segment long term debt may have fixed or variable interest rate for long term debt with variable rate interest we estimate the future interest payment based on projected market interest rate for various floating rate benchmark received from third party in addition part of our normal business practice we enter into contract with supplier for purchase of certain raw material component and service to facilitate adequate supply of these material and service these arrangement may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirement purchase obligation are defined off balance sheet agreement to purchase good or service that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant term the table below summarizes our contractual obligation of december in million payment due by period and thereafter totalnon financial service on balance sheet long

tax agreement among and various country the timing of which can not reasonably be estimated for additional information regarding operating lease obligation pension and opeb obligation and long term debt see note and respectively of the note to the financial statement quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskoverviewwe are exposed to variety of market and other risk including the effect of change in foreign currency exchange rate commodity price and interest rate well risk to availability of funding source hazard event and specific asset risk these risk affect our automotive and financial service segment differently we monitor and manage these exposure an integral part of our overall risk management program which includes regular report to central management committee the global risk management committee grmc the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer and it member include our treasurer our corporate controller and other member of senior management our automotive and financial service segment are exposed to liquidity risk including the possibility of having to curtail business or being unable to meet financial obligation they come due because funding source may be reduced or become unavailable our plan is to maintain funding source to ensure liquidity through variety of economic or business cycle discussed in greater detail in item our funding source include sale of receivables in securitizations and other structured financing unsecured debt issuance equity and equity linked issuance and bank borrowing we are exposed to variety of insurable risk such loss or damage to property liability claim and employee injury we protect against these risk through the purchase of commercial insurance that is designed to protect above our self insured retention against event that could generate significant loss direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategy resides with our treasurer office and is governed by written policy and procedure separation of duty is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trade the transaction of derivative and the settlement of cash flow regular audit are conducted to ensure that appropriate control are in place and that they remain effective in addition our market risk exposure and our use of derivative to manage these exposure are approved by the grmc and reviewed by the audit committee of our board of director in accordance with our corporate risk management policy we use derivative instrument when available such forward contract swap and option that economically hedge certain exposure foreign currency commodity and interest rate we do not use derivative contract for trading market making or speculative purpose in certain instance we forgo hedge accounting and in certain other instance our derivative do not qualify for hedge accounting either situation result in unrealized gain and loss that are recognized in income for additional information on our derivative see note of the note to the financial statement the market and counterparty risk of our automotive segment and ford credit are discussed and quantified below automotive market riskour automotive segment frequently ha expenditure and receipt denominated in foreign currency including the following purchase and sale of finished vehicle and production part debt and other payable subsidiary dividend and investment in foreign operation these expenditure and receipt create exposure to change in exchange rate we also are exposed to change in price of commodity used in our automotive segment and change in interest rate foreign currency risk commodity risk and interest rate risk are measured and quantified using model to evaluate the sensitivity of market value to instantaneous parallel shift in rate and or price foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial result could be better or worse than planned because of change in currency exchange rate accordingly our normal practice is to use derivative instrument when available to hedge our economic exposure with respect to forecasted revenue and cost asset liability and firm commitment denominated in foreign currency in our hedging action we use derivative instrument commonly used by corporation to reduce foreign exchange risk forward contract the net fair value of foreign exchange forward contract including adjustment for credit risk of december wa an asset of million compared with an asset of million of december the potential decrease in fair value from adverse change in the underlying exchange rate in dollar term would have been billion at december compared with billion at december the sensitivity analysis quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued presented is hypothetical and assumes foreign exchange rate change are instantaneous and adverse across all currency in reality foreign exchange rate move in different magnitude and at different time and any change in fair value would generally be offset by change in the underlying exposure see note of the note to the financial statement for more information regarding our foreign currency exchange contract commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility that our financial result could be better or worse than planned because of change in the price of commodity used in the production of motor vehicle such base metal steel copper and aluminum precious metal palladium energy natural gas and electricity and plastic resin polypropylene accordingly our normal practice is to use derivative instrument when available to hedge the price risk with respect to forecasted purchase of those commodity that we can economically hedge primarily base metal and precious metal in our hedging action we use derivative instrument commonly used by corporation to reduce commodity price risk financially settled forward contract the net fair value of commodity forward contract including adjustment for credit risk of december wa liability of million compared with an asset of million of december the potential decrease in fair value from adverse change in the underlying commodity price in dollar term would be million at december compared with million at december in addition our purchasing organization with guidance from the grmc appropriate negotiates contract to ensure continuous supply of raw material in some case these contract stipulate minimum purchase amount and specific price and therefore play role in managing price risk interest rate risk interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur in our automotive segment investment portfolio due to change in interest rate our interest rate sensitivity analysis on the investment portfolio includes cash and cash equivalent and net marketable security at december we had billion in our automotive segment investment portfolio compared to billion at december we invest the portfolio in security of various type and maturity the value of which are subject to fluctuation in interest rate the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guideline to maintain liquidity minimize risk and earn reasonable return on the short term investment in investing our automotive cash safety of principal is the primary objective and risk adjusted return is the secondary objective at any time rise in interest rate could have material adverse impact on the fair value of our portfolio assuming hypothetical increase in interest rate of one percentage point the value of our portfolio would be reduced by about million calculated of december this compare to million calculated of december while these are our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario actual result could differ from those projected the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate change are instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve in reality interest rate change of this magnitude are rarely instantaneous or parallel counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or derivative contract we enter into master agreement with counterparties that allow netting of certain exposure in order to manage this risk exposure primarily relate to investment in fixed income instrument and derivative contract used for managing interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price risk we together with ford credit establish exposure limit for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive allowing to take risk mitigation action before risk become loss exposure limit are established based on our overall risk tolerance and estimated loss projection which are calculated from rating based historical default probability and market based credit default swap cd spread the exposure limit are lower for lower rated counterparties counterparties that have relatively higher cd spread and for longer dated exposure our exposure are monitored on regular basis and included in periodic report to our treasurer substantially all of our counterparty exposure are with counterparties that have an investment grade rating investment grade is our guideline for counterparty minimum long term rating quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued ford credit market risk market risk for ford credit is the possibility that change in interest and currency exchange rate will adversely affect cash flow and economic value interest rate risk generally ford credit asset and the related debt have different re pricing period and consequently respond differently to change in interest rate ford credit asset consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and operating lease contract and floating rate wholesale receivables fixed rate retail installment sale and operating lease contract generally require customer to make equal monthly payment over the life of the contract wholesale receivables are originated to finance new and used vehicle held in dealer inventory and generally require dealer to pay floating rate debt consists primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and securitization debt ford credit unsecured term debt instrument are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payment over the life of the instrument and single principal payment at maturity ford credit interest rate risk management objective is to reduce volatility in it cash flow and volatility in it economic value from change in interest rate based on an established risk tolerance that may vary by market ford credit us economic value sensitivity analysis and re pricing gap analysis to evaluate potential long term effect of change in interest rate it then enters into interest rate swap to convert portion of it floating rate debt to fixed or it fixed rate debt to floating to ensure that ford credit exposure fall within the established tolerance ford credit also us pre tax cash flow sensitivity analysis to monitor the level of near term cash flow exposure the pre tax cash flow sensitivity analysis measure the change in expected cash flow associated with ford credit interest rate sensitive asset liability and derivative financial instrument from hypothetical change in interest rate over twelve month horizon ford credit asset liability committee review the re pricing mismatch and exposure every month and approves interest rate swap required to maintain exposure within approved threshold prior to execution to provide quantitative measure of the sensitivity of it pre tax cash flow to change in interest rate ford credit us interest rate scenario that assume hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rate across all maturity parallel shift well base case that assumes that all interest rate remain constant at existing level in reality interest rate change are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rate could move more or le than the one percentage point assumed in ford credit analysis result the actual impact to pre tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the result detailed in the table below these interest rate scenario are purely hypothetical and do not represent ford credit view of future interest rate movement under these interest rate scenario ford credit expects more asset than debt and liability to re price in the next twelve month other thing being equal this mean that during period of rising interest rate the interest earned on ford credit asset will increase more than the interest paid on ford credit debt thereby initially increasing ford credit pre tax cash flow during period of falling interest rate ford credit would expect it pre tax cash flow to initially decrease ford credit pre tax cash flow sensitivity to interest rate movement is highlighted in the table below pre tax cash flow sensitivity at december wa follows in million pre tax cash flow sensitivity percentage point instantaneous increase in interest rate percentage point instantaneous decrease in interest rate _____ pre tax cash flow sensitivity given one percentage point decrease in interest rate requires an assumption of negative interest rate in market where existing interest rate are below one percent while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit best estimate of the impact of the specified assumed interest rate scenario it actual result could differ from those projected the model ford credit us to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumption embedded in the model are assumption regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivative exercise of option embedded in debt and derivative and predicted repayment of retail installment sale and lease contract ahead of contractual maturity ford credit repayment projection ahead of contractual maturity are based on historical experience if interest rate or other factor change ford credit actual prepayment experience could be different than projected quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk continued foreign currency risk ford credit policy is to minimize exposure to change in currency exchange rate to meet funding objective ford credit borrows in variety of currency principally dollar canadian dollar euro pound sterling and renminbi ford credit face exposure to currency exchange rate if mismatch exists between the currency of receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables when possible receivables are funded with debt in the same currency minimizing exposure to exchange rate movement when different currency is used ford credit may use foreign currency swap and foreign currency forward to convert substantially all of it foreign currency debt obligation to the local country currency of the receivables result of this policy ford credit belief it market risk exposure relating to change in currency exchange rate at december is insignificant derivative fair value the net fair value of ford credit derivative financial instrument at december wa an asset of million compared to an asset of million at december item financial statement and supplementary data the report of independent registered public accounting firm our financial statement the accompanying note to the financial statement

in the manner in which an asset group is used or in it physical condition when triggering event occurs test for recoverability is performed comparing projected undiscounted future cash flow to the carrying value of the asset group if the test for recoverability identifies possible impairment the asset group fair value is measured relying primarily on discounted cash flow method an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds it estimated fair value when an impairment loss is recognized for asset to be held and used the adjusted carrying amount of those asset is depreciated over their remaining useful life no impairment of long lived asset wa recorded in or goodwillwe perform annual testing of goodwill during the fourth

our consolidated balance sheet for the period presented we have not recorded any impairment fair value measurementscash equivalent marketable security and derivative financial instrument are remeasured and presented on our financial statement on recurring basis at fair value while other asset and liability are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis in measuring fair value we use various valuation method and prioritize the use of observable input the use of observable and unobservable input and their significance in measuring fair value are reflected in our fair value hierarchy level input include quoted price for identical instrument and are the most observable level input include quoted price for similar instrument and observable input such interest rate currency exchange rate and yield curve level input include data not observable in the market and reflect management judgment about the assumption market participant would use in pricing the instrumentstransfers into and transfer out of the hierarchy level are recognized if they had taken place at the end of the reporting period valuation methodcash and cash equivalent included in cash and cash equivalent are highly liquid investment that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate quoted price or penalty on withdrawal debt security is classified cash equivalent if it meet these criterion and if it ha remaining time to maturity of three month or le from the date of acquisition amount on deposit and available upon demand or negotiated to provide for daily liquidity without penalty are classified cash and cash equivalent time deposit certificate of deposit and money market account that meet the above criterion are reported at par value on our balance sheet motor company and subsidiariesnotes to the financial statementsnote summary of significant accounting policy continued marketable security investment in security with maturity date greater than three month at the date of purchase and other security for which there is more than an insignificant risk of change in value due to interest rate quoted price or penalty on withdrawal are classified marketable security we generally measure fair value using price obtained from pricing service pricing method and input to valuation model used by the pricing service depend on the security type asset class where possible fair value are generated using market input including quoted price the closing price in an exchange market bid price the price at which buyer stand ready to purchase and other market information for fixed income security that are not actively traded the pricing service use alternative method to determine fair value for the security including quote for similar fixed income security matrix pricing discounted cash flow using benchmark curve or other factor in certain case when market data are not available we may use broker quote to determine fair value an annual review is performed on the security price received from our pricing service which includes discussion and analysis of the input used by the pricing service to value our security we also compare the price of certain security sold close to the quarter end to the price of the same security at the balance sheet date to ensure the reported fair value is reasonable realized gain and loss and interest income on all of our marketable security and unrealized gain and loss on security not classified available for sale are recorded in non financial service interest income and other income loss net and financial service other income loss net unrealized gain and loss on available for sale security are recognized in unrealized gain and loss on security component of other comprehensive income loss net of tax realized gain and loss and reclassification of accumulated other comprehensive income into net income are measured using the specific identification method on quarterly basis we review our available for sale security for impairment if we conclude that any of these investment are impaired we determine whether such impairment is other than temporary factor we consider to make such determination include the duration and severity of the impairment the reason for the decline in value and the potential recovery period and our intent to sell if any impairment is considered other than temporary we will write down the asset to it fair value and record the corresponding charge in non financial service interest income and other income loss net derivative financial instrument our derivative are over the counter customized derivative transaction and are not exchange traded we estimate the fair value of these instrument using industry standard valuation model such discounted cash flow these model project future cash flow and discount the future amount to present value using market based expectation for interest rate foreign exchange rate commodity price and the contractual term of the derivative instrument the discount rate used is the relevant interbank deposit rate libor plus an adjustment for non performance risk the adjustment reflects the full credit default swap cd spread applied to net exposure by counterparty considering the master netting agreement and any posted collateral we use our counterparty cd spread when we are in net asset position and our own cd spread when we are in net liability position in certain case market data is not available and we use broker quote and model black scholes to determine fair value this includes situation where there is lack of liquidity for particular currency or commodity or when the instrument is longer dated finance receivables we measure finance receivables at fair value for purpose of disclosure see note using internal valuation model these model project future cash flow of financing contract based on scheduled contract payment including principal and interest the projected cash flow are discounted to present value based on assumption regarding credit loss pre payment speed and applicable spread to approximate current rate our assumption regarding pre payment speed and credit loss are based on historical performance the fair value of finance receivables is categorized within level of the hierarchy on nonrecurring basis we also measure at fair value retail contract greater than day past due or deemed to be uncollectible and individual dealer loan probable of foreclosure we use the fair value of collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell to determine the fair value of our receivables the collateral for retail receivable is the vehicle financed and for dealer loan is real estate or other property motor company and subsidiariesnotes to the financial statementsnote summary of significant accounting policy continued the fair value of collateral for retail receivables is calculated by multiplying the outstanding receivable balance by the average recovery value percentage the fair value of collateral for dealer loan is determined by reviewing various appraisal which include total adjusted appraised value of land and improvement alternate use appraised value broker opinion of value and purchase offer debt we measure debt at fair value for purpose of disclosure see note using quoted price for our own debt with approximately the same remaining maturity where quoted price are not available we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow and market based expectation for interest rate credit risk and the contractual term of the debt instrument for certain short term debt with an original maturity date of one year or le we assume that book value is reasonable approximation of the debt fair value the fair value of debt is categorized within level of the hierarchy employee separation action and exit and disposal activitieswe record cost associated with voluntary separation at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the company we record cost associated with involuntary separation program when management ha approved the plan for separation

information that improves it statistical predictability in addition we regularly audit dealer inventory and dealer sale record to verify that the dealer is in possession of the financed vehicle and is promptly paying each receivable following the sale of the financed vehicle the frequency of on site vehicle inventory audit depends on factor such the dealer risk rating and our security position under our policy on site vehicle inventory audit of low risk dealer are conducted only circumstance warrant audit of higher risk dealer are conducted with increased frequency based on risk rating and

for credit loss the allowance for credit loss represents our estimate of the probable credit loss inherent in finance receivables of the balance sheet date the adequacy of the allowance for credit

number of assumption about matter that are uncertain the majority of credit loss are attributable to ford credit consumer receivables portfolio addition to the allowance for credit loss are made by recording charge to financial service interest operating and other expense on the income statement the uncollectible portion of finance receivables are charged to the allowance for credit loss at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is day delinquent taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer borrower or lessee the value of the

measurement model and management judgment the model consider factor such historical trend in credit loss and recovery including key metric such delinquency repossession and bankruptcy the composition of the present portfolio including vehicle brand term risk evaluation and new used vehicle trend in historical used vehicle value and economic condition estimate from these model rely on historical information and may not fully reflect loss inherent in the present portfolio therefore we may adjust the estimate to reflect management judgment regarding observable change in recent economic trend and condition portfolio composition and other relevant factor we make projection of two key assumption to assist in estimating the consumer allowance for credit loss frequency number of finance receivables contract that are expected to default over the loss emergence period measured repossession and loss severity expected difference between the amount customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received net of expense from selling the repossessed vehiclecollective allowance for credit loss the collective allowance is evaluated primarily using collective loss to receivables ltr model that based on historical experience indicates credit loss have been incurred in the portfolio even though the particular account that are uncollectible can not be specifically identified the ltr model is based on the most recent year of history each ltr is calculated by dividing credit loss by average finance receivables excluding unearned interest supplement and allowance for credit loss an average ltr is calculated for each product and multiplied by the end of period balance for that given product motor company and subsidiariesnotes to the financial statementsnote financial service allowance for credit loss continued our largest market also use loss projection model to estimate loss inherent in the portfolio the loss projection model applies recent monthly performance metric stratified by contract type retail or lease contract term month and risk rating to our active portfolio to estimate the loss that have been incurred the loss emergence period lep is an assumption within our model and represents the average amount of time between when loss event first occurs and when it is charged off this time period start when the consumer begin to experience financial difficulty it is evidenced typically through delinquency before eventually resulting in charge off the lep is multiplier in the calculation of the collective consumer allowance for credit loss for account greater than day past due the uncollectible portion is charged off such that the remaining recorded investment is equal to the estimated fair value of the collateral le cost to sell specific allowance for impaired receivables consumer receivables involved in tdrs are specifically assessed for impairment specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the contract original effective interest rate or the fair value of any collateral adjusted for estimated cost to sell after establishing the collective and specific allowance for credit loss if management belief the allowance doe not reflect all loss inherent in the portfolio due to change in recent economic trend and condition or other relevant factor an adjustment is made based on management judgment non consumer we estimate the allowance for credit loss for non consumer receivables based on historical ltr ratio expected future cash flow and the fair value of collateral collective allowance for credit loss we estimate an allowance for non consumer receivables that are not specifically identified impaired using ltr model for each financing product based on historical experience this ltr is an average of the most recent historical experience and is calculated consistent with the consumer receivables ltr approach all account that are specifically identified impaired are excluded from the calculation of the non specific or collective allowance specific allowance for impaired receivables dealer financing is evaluated by segmenting individual loan by the risk characteristic of the loan such the amount of the loan the nature of the collateral and the financial status of the debtor the loan are analyzed to determine whether individual loan are impaired and specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flow of the receivable discounted at the loan original effective

volatility relative to the obligation the majority of plan asset are allocated to fixed income investment which are exposed to interest rate risk rate increase generally will result in decline in the value of fixed income asset while reducing the present value of the obligation conversely rate decrease generally will increase the value of fixed income asset offsetting the related increase in the obligation in order to ensure asset are sufficient to pay benefit portion of plan asset is allocated to growth asset that are expected over time to earn higher return with more volatility than fixed
