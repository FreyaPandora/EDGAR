industry and market may adversely impact our financial result our accelerated computing platform experience rapid change in technology customer requirement competitive product and industry standard our success depends on our ability to timely identify industry change adapt our strategy and develop new or enhance existing product and technology that meet the evolving need of these market including due to unexpected change in industry standard or disruptive technological innovation that could render our product incompatible with product developed by other company develop new product and technology through investment in research and development launch new offering with new business model including standalone software cloud solution and software infrastructure or platform service solution expand the ecosystem for our product and technology meet evolving and prevailing customer and industry safety and compliance standard manage product and software lifecycles to maintain customer and end user satisfaction develop acquire and maintain the internal and external infrastructure needed to scale our business including our acquisition integration customer support commerce ip licensing capability and cloud service capacity and complete technical financial compliance sale and marketing investment for some of the activity we invest in research and development in market where we have limited operating history which may not produce meaningful revenue for several year if at all if we fail to develop or monetize new product and technology or if they do not become widely adopted our financial result could be adversely affected obtaining design win may involve lengthy process and depend on our ability to anticipate and provide feature and functionality that customer will demand they also do not guarantee revenue failure to obtain design win may prevent from obtaining future design win in subsequent generation we can not ensure that the product and technology we bring to market will provide value to our customer and partner if we fail any of these key success criterion our financial result may be harmed we will offer enterprise customer nvidia ai cloud service directly and through our network of partner example of these service include nvidia dgx cloud which is cloud based infrastructure and software for training ai model and customizable pretrained ai model nvidia ha partnered with leading cloud service provider to host these service in their data center and we entered into multi year cloud service agreement in the second half of fiscal year to support these offering and our research and development activity nvidia ai cloud service may not be successful and will take time resource and investment we also offer or plan to offer standalone software solution for ai including nvidia ai enterprise nvidia omniverse nvidia drive for automotive and several other software solution these new of contentsbusiness model or strategy may not be successful and we may fail to sell any meaningful standalone software or service solution we may incur significant cost and may not achieve any significant revenue from these offering competition in our current and target market could cause to lose market share and revenue our target market remain competitive and competition may intensify with expanding and changing product and service offering industry standard customer need new entrant and consolidation our competitor product service and technology including those mentioned above in this annual report on form may be cheaper or provide better functionality or feature than ours which ha resulted and may in the future result in lower than expected selling price for our product some of our competitor operate their own fabrication facility have longer operating history larger customer base more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection new design and more design win and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to acquire market share and or prevent from so more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market and end user customer trend more quickly transition their product and secure sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material during supply constrained environment which could harm our business some of our customer have in house expertise and internal development capability similar to some of ours and can use or develop their own solution to replace those we are providing for example others may offer cloud based service that compete with our ai cloud service offering and we may not be able to establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objective if we are unable to successfully compete in this environment demand for our product service and technology could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline risk related to demand supply and manufacturingfailure to estimate customer demand properly ha led and could lead to mismatch between supply and demand we use third party to manufacture and assemble our product and we have had and may in the future have long manufacturing lead time we are not provided guaranteed wafer component and capacity supply and our supply delivery and production may be non linear within quarter or year if our estimate of customer demand are ultimately inaccurate we have experienced from time to time there could be significant mismatch between supply and demand this mismatch ha resulted in both product shortage and excess inventory ha varied across our market platform and ha significantly harmed our financial result we build finished product and maintain inventory in advance of anticipated demand while we have in the past entered and may in the future enter into long term supply and capacity commitment we may not be able to secure sufficient commitment for capacity to address our business need or our long term demand expectation may change additionally our ability to sell certain product ha been and could be impeded if component from third party that are necessary for the finished product are not available in period of shortage impacting the semiconductor industry and or limited supply or capacity in our supply chain the lead time on our order may be extended we have previously experienced extended lead time of more than month we have paid premium and provided deposit to secure future supply and capacity which have increased our product cost and may continue to do so we may not have the ability to reduce our supply commitment at the same rate or at all if our revenue decline demand for our product is based on many factor in addition to the lead time described above that have caused and or could in the future cause to either underestimate or overestimate our customer future demand for our product or otherwise cause mismatch between supply and demand for our product and impact the timing and volume of our revenue including competing technology and competitor product release and announcement change in business and economic condition resulting in decreased end demand sudden or sustained government lockdown or action to control case spread of covid or other global or local health issue rapidly changing technology or customer requirement time to market of content new product introduction and transition resulting in le demand for existing product new or unexpected end use case increase in demand for competitive product including competitive action business decision made by third party the demand for accelerated or ai related cloud service including our own software and ai cloud service offering the demand for cryptocurrency mining or government action or change in governmental policy such increased restriction on gaming usage our supply which includes inventory on hand purchase obligation and prepaid supply agreement ha grown significantly due to current supply chain condition complexity of our product and recent reduction in demand at the end of fiscal year purchase obligation and prepaid supply agreement represented more than half of our total supply we may incur inventory provision if our inventory or supply commitment are misaligned with demand for our product our demand prediction may not be correct we have experienced from time to time product transition are complex and frequently negatively impact our revenue we often ship both new and legacy architecture product simultaneously and we and our channel partner prepare to ship and support new product our architecture transition of data center professional visualization and gaming product may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix qualification time for new product customer anticipating product transition and channel partner reducing channel inventory of legacy architecture ahead of new product introduction can create reduction or volatility in our revenue we have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architecture when customer anticipate transition and we may be unable to sell multiple product architecture at the same time for current and future architecture transition while we have managed prior product transition and have previously sold multiple product architecture at the same time these transition are difficult and prior trend may not continue if we are unable to execute our architectural transition planned for any reason our financial result may be negatively impacted we sell most of our product through channel partner who sell to distributor retailer and or end customer result the decision made by our channel partner distributor retailer and in response to changing market condition and change in end user demand for our product have impacted and could in the future continue to impact our ability to properly forecast demand particularly they are based on estimate provided by various downstream party if we underestimate our customer future demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill order on timely basis even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in cost effective or timely manner or our contract manufacturer may experience supply constraint if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be harmed if we overestimate our customer future demand for our product or if customer cancel or defer order or choose to purchase from our competitor we may not be able to reduce our inventory or other contractual purchase commitment in the past we have experienced reduction in average selling price including due to channel pricing program that we have implemented and may continue to implement result of our overestimation of future demand and we may need to continue these reduction we have had to increase price for certain of our product result of our supplier increase in price and we may need to continue to do so for other product in the future we have also written our inventory incurred cancellation penalty and recorded impairment these impact were amplified by our placement of non cancellable and non returnable purchasing term well in advance of our historical lead time and could be exacerbated if we need to make change to the design of future product the risk of these impact ha increased our purchase obligation and prepaids have grown and become greater portion of our total supply while our of contentsrevenue ha sequentially declined all of these factor may negatively impact our gross margin and financial result we build technology and product for use case and application that may be new or may not yet exist example include our omniverse platform and third party large language model and generative model our demand estimate for these use case and application can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply level and we may not be able to generate any revenue from these use case and application challenge in estimating demand could become more pronounced or volatile in the future on both global and regional basis extended lead time may occur if we experience other supply constraint caused by natural disaster pandemic or other event such the covid pandemic in addition geopolitical tension such those involving taiwan and china which comprise significant portion of our revenue and where we have supplier contract manufacturer and assembly partner who are critical to our supply continuity could have material adverse impact on the use of our gpus for other than that for which they were designed and marketed including new and unexpected use case ha impacted and can in the future impact demand for our product including by leading to inconsistent spike and drop in demand for example number of year ago our gaming gpus began to be used for digital currency mining including blockchain based platform such ethereum it is difficult for to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency mining on demand for our product volatility in the cryptocurrency market including new compute technology price change in cryptocurrencies government cryptocurrency policy and regulation new cryptocurrency standard and change in the method of verifying blockchain transaction ha impacted and can in the future impact cryptocurrency mining and demand for our product and can further impact our ability to estimate demand for our product change to cryptocurrency standard and process including but not limited to the recently implemented ethereum merge may decrease the usage of gpus for ethereum mining well create increased aftermarket sale of our gpus which could negatively impact retail price for our gpus and reduce demand for our new gpus we previously introduced lite hash rate or lhr geforce gpus with limited ethereum mining capability and provided cmp product in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miner to cmp with the ethereum merge nvidia ampere and ada lovelace architecture no longer include lhr in addition our new product or previously sold product may be resold online or on the unauthorized gray market which also make demand forecasting difficult gray market product and reseller marketplace compete with our new product and distribution channel additionally we depend on developer and other third party to build accelerated computing application that leverage our platform we also rely on third party content provider and publisher to make their content available on our platform such geforce now failure by developer to build application that leverage our platform or failure by third party content provider or publisher to make their content available on reasonable term or at all for use by our customer or end user on our platform could adversely affect customer demand dependency on third party supplier and their technology to manufacture assemble test package or design our product reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yield development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we depend on foundry to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique we do not assemble test or package our product but instead contract with independent subcontractor we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool we face several risk which have adversely affected or could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand and scale our supply chain negatively impact longer term demand for our product and service and adversely affect our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer component and capacity or decommitment and potential higher wafer and component price from incorrectly estimating demand and failing to place order with our supplier with sufficient quantity or in timely manner of content failure by our foundry or contract manufacturer to procure raw material or to provide adequate level of manufacturing or test capacity for our product failure by our foundry to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology such advanced process node technology and memory design needed to manufacture our product limited number and geographic concentration of global supplier foundry contract manufacturer assembly and test provider and memory manufacturer loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over product quantity quality and delivery schedule supplier or their supplier failing to supply high quality product and or making change to their product without our qualification delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor or other customer order over ours requirement to place order that are not cancellable upon change in demand or requirement to prepay for supply in advance low manufacturing yield resulting from failure in our product design or foundry proprietary process technology and disruption in manufacturing assembly and other process due to closure related to heat wave or other natural disaster and electricity conservation effort defect in our product have caused and could cause to incur significant expense to remediate which can damage our reputation and cause to lose market share our hardware and software product offering are complex and they have in the past and may in the future contain defect or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology and application or new version are released these risk further increase when we rely on partner to supply and manufacture component that are used in our product these arrangement reduce our direct control over production although arrangement with component provider may contain provision for product defect expense reimbursement we generally remain responsible to the customer for warranty product defect that may occur from time to time some failure in our product or service have been in the past and may in the future be only discovered after product or service ha been shipped or used undiscovered vulnerability in our product or service could result in loss of data or intangible property or expose our end customer to unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy malicious software program that could attack our product or service defect or failure of our product to perform to specification could lead to substantial damage to the product or the product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and automotive manufacturer and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost part of product recall or otherwise write off the value of related inventory and divert the attention of our engineering and management personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue our effort to remedy these issue may not be timely or satisfactory to our customer an error or defect in new product release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in failure to achieve market acceptance loss of design win temporary or permanent withdrawal from product or market and harm to our relationship with existing and prospective customer and partner and consumer perception of our brand which would in turn negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result we may be required to reimburse our customer partner or consumer including for cost to repair or replace product in the field or in connection with indemnification obligation or pay fine imposed by regulatory agency of contentsfor example defect wa identified in third party component embedded in certain data center product this defect ha had and other defect may in the future have an adverse effect on our cost and supply of component and finished good these cost could be significant in future period we recorded net warranty liability during fiscal year primarily in connection with this defect while we believe we have accurately recorded for warranty obligation we may need to record additional amount in the future if our estimate prof to be incorrect in general if product liability claim regarding any of our product is brought even if the alleged damage is due to the action or inaction of third party such within our supply chain the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result risk related to our global operating businessadverse economic condition may harm our business economic and industry uncertainty or change including recession or slowing growth inflation change or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy disruption to capital market currency fluctuation higher interest rate tighter credit lower capital expenditure by business including on it infrastructure increase in unemployment labor shortage and lower consumer confidence and spending have in the past and or could in the future have adverse wide ranging effect on our business and financial result including increased cost for wafer component logistics and other supply chain expense which have negatively impacted our gross margin and may continue to do so increased supply employee facility and infrastructure cost and volatility in the financial market which have reduced and may in the future reduce our margin decrease in demand for our product service and technology and those of our customer partner or licensee the inability of our supplier to deliver on their supply commitment to and our customer or our licensee inability to supply product to customer and or end user limit on our ability to forecast operating result and make business decision the insolvency of key supplier distributor customer or licensing party reduced profitability may also cause some customer to scale back operation exit business or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operation lead to merger consolidation or strategic alliance among other company which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and increased credit and collectability risk higher borrowing cost or reduced availability of capital market reduced liquidity adverse impact on our supplier failure of counterparties including financial institution and insurer asset impairment and decline in the value of our financial instrument international operation are significant part of our business which expose to to risk that could harm our business we conduct our business and have office worldwide our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state and we generated of our revenue during fiscal year from sale outside of the united state the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty which have had in the past and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation including domestic and international economic and political condition between country in which we and our supplier and manufacturer do business government lockdown to control case spread of covid or other global or local health issue differing legal standard with respect to protection of ip and employment practice domestic and international business and cultural practice that differ disruption to capital market counter inflation policy and or currency fluctuation and natural disaster act of war or other military action terrorism public health issue and other catastrophic event of contentsproduct system security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware social engineering attack denial of service attack software bug server malfunction software or hardware failure loss of data or other information technology asset and other cyber attack are increasingly sophisticated making it more difficult to successfully detect defend against them or implement adequate preventative measure cyber attack including ransomware attack by organized criminal threat actor nation state and nation state supported actor may become more prevalent and severe our ability to recover from ransomware attack may be limited if our backup have been affected by the attack or if restoring from backup is delayed or not feasible threat actor sophisticated nation state and nation state supported actor now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber attack due to increasing geopolitical conflict and during time of war or other major conflict we and the third party upon which we rely may be vulnerable to heightened risk of cyber attack that could materially disrupt our ability to provide service and product furthermore we rely on product and service provided by third party supplier to operate certain critical business system including without limitation cloud based infrastructure encryption and authentication technology employee email and other function which expose to supply chain attack or other business disruption we can not guarantee that third party and infrastructure in our supply chain or our partner supply chain have not been compromised or that they do not contain exploitable defect or bug that could result in breach of or disruption to our information technology system including our product and service or the third party information technology system that support our service our ability to monitor these third party information security practice is limited and these may not have adequate information security measure in place in addition if one of our third party supplier suffers security breach our response may be limited or more difficult because we may not have direct access to their system log and other information related to the security breach additionally we are incorporated into the supply chain of large number of entity worldwide and result if our product or service are compromised significant number of our customer and their data could be affected which could result in potential liability and harm our business to defend against cyber attack we must continuously engineer more secure product and enhance security and reliability feature which is expected to result in increased expense we must also continue to develop our security measure ensure our supplier have appropriate security measure in place and continue to meet the evolving security requirement of our customer applicable industry standard and government regulation while we take step to detect and remediate certain vulnerability that we have identified we may not always be able to detect all vulnerability in our security control system or software including third party software we have installed such threat and technique change frequently and may not be detected after security incident ha occurred further we may experience delay in developing and deploying remedial measure designed to address identified vulnerability these vulnerability could result in reputational and financial harm we hold confidential and proprietary information including information from partner and customer breach of our security measure along with reported or perceived vulnerability or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about or third party could expose and the party affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information potentially resulting in litigation and subsequent liability regulatory inquiry or action damage to our brand and reputation or other harm including financial to our business for example we hold propriety game source code from third party partner in our gfn service breach of our gfn security measure which have happened in the past could expose our partner to risk of loss or misuse of this source code damage both and our partner and expose nvidia to potential litigation and liability if we or third party we rely on experience security incident which ha occurred in the past or are perceived to have experienced security incident we may experience adverse consequence including government enforcement action additional reporting requirement and or oversight restriction on processing data litigation indemnification obligation reputational harm diversion of fund financial loss loss of data material disruption in our system and operation supply chain and ability to produce sell and distribute our good and service and other similar harm inability to fulfill order delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation of contentsbusiness disruption could harm our operation lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by natural disaster and extreme weather condition power or water shortage telecommunication failure cloud service provider outage terrorist attack or act of violence political and or civil unrest act of war or other military action epidemic or pandemic and other natural or man made disaster and catastrophic event our corporate headquarters large portion of our current data center capacity and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation finished good inventory and some of our supplier are located in asia making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster such earthquake wildfire or other business disruption occurring in these geographical area catastrophic event can also have an impact on third party vendor who provide critical infrastructure service for it and research and development system and personnel geopolitical and domestic political development and other event beyond our control can increase economic volatility globally political instability change in government or adverse political development in or around any of the major country in which we do business would also likely harm our business financial condition and result of operation worldwide geopolitical tension and conflict including but not limited to china hong kong israel korea and taiwan where the manufacture of our product component and final assembly of our product are concentrated may result in changing regulatory requirement and other disruption that could impact our operation and operating strategy product demand access to global market hiring and profitability for example other country have restricted and may continue in the future to restrict business with the state of israel where we have engineering sale support operation and manufacturing and company with israeli operation including by economic boycott our operation could be harmed and our cost could increase if manufacturing logistics or other operation are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health or political issue the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier of being located and consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event disaster war or catastrophic event affect the third party system on which we rely or our customer our business could be harmed result of decline in revenue increase in expense and substantial expenditure and time spent to fully resume operation all of these risk and condition could materially adversely affect our future sale and operating result climate change may have long term impact on our business climate change may have an increasingly adverse impact on our business and those of our customer partner and vendor water and energy availability and reliability in the community where we conduct business is critical and certain of our facility may be vulnerable to the impact of extreme weather event extreme heat and wind coupled with dry condition in northern california may lead to power safety shut offs due to wildfire risk which can have adverse implication for our santa clara california headquarter office and data center including impairing the ability of our employee to work effectively climate change it impact on our supply chain and critical infrastructure worldwide and it potential to increase political instability in region where we our customer partner and our vendor do business may disrupt our business and cause to experience higher attrition loss and cost to maintain or resume operation although we maintain insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability and cost some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion and our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition our business and those of our supplier and customer may also be subject to climate related law regulation and lawsuit regulation such carbon tax fuel or energy tax and pollution limit could result in greater direct cost including cost associated with change to manufacturing process or the procurement of raw material used in manufacturing process increased capital expenditure to improve facility and equipment and higher compliance and energy cost to reduce emission well greater indirect cost resulting from our customer supplier or both incurring additional compliance cost that are passed on to these cost and restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter our operation and product design activity stakeholder group may find insufficiently responsive to the implication of climate change and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm we may not achieve our stated goal to source of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year which could harm our reputation or we may incur additional of contentsunexpected cost to achieve such goal we may also experience contractual dispute due to supply chain delay arising from climate change related disruption which could result in increased litigation and cost we also face risk related to business trend that may be influenced by climate change concern we may face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive product such our gpus despite their energy efficient design and operation and or increased consumer or customer expectation around the energy efficiency of our product could negatively impact our business we may not be able to realize the potential benefit of business investment or acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have acquired and invested and may continue to do so in business that offer product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objective acquisition or investment involve significant challenge and risk and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product and ultimately could have negative impact on our financial result if we pursue particular transaction we may limit our ability to enter into other transaction that could help achieve our other strategic objective if we are unable to timely complete acquisition including due to delay and challenge in obtaining regulatory approval we may be unable to pursue other transaction we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company technology may evolve and make the acquisition le attractive and other change can take place which could reduce the anticipated benefit of the transaction and negatively impact our business for example in february nvidia and softbank announced the termination of the share purchase agreement whereby nvidia would have acquired arm from softbank due to significant regulatory challenge preventing the completion of the transaction we recorded in operating expense billion charge in fiscal year reflecting the write off of the prepayment provided at signing regulator could also impose condition that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisition in addition to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisition ha been harmed future acquisition may be more difficult complex or expensive further if we hold investment in publicly traded company they could create volatility in our result and may generate loss up to the value of the investment additional risk related to acquisition or strategic investment include but are not limited to difficulty in integrating the technology system product policy process or operation and integrating and retaining the employee including key personnel of the acquired business diversion of capital and other resource including management attention assumption of liability and incurring amortization expense impairment charge to goodwill or write down of acquired asset integrating accounting forecasting and control procedure and reporting cycle coordinating and integrating operation particularly in country in which we do not currently operate difficulty in realizing satisfactory return and uncertainty to realize the benefit of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all difficulty or inability in obtaining governmental regulatory approval or restriction or other consent and approval or financing stock price impact fine fee or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition legal proceeding initiated result of an acquisition or investment potential issuance of debt to finance our acquisition resulting in increased debt increased interest expense and compliance with debt covenant or other restriction the potential for our acquisition to result in dilutive issuance of our equity security the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance based consideration of content negative change in general economic condition in the region or the industry in which we or our target operate exposure to additional cybersecurity risk and vulnerability potential failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issue with the asset or company in which we are investing or are acquiring and impairment of relationship with or loss of our or our target employee vendor and customer for example when integrating acquisition target system into our own we have experienced and may continue to experience challenge including lengthy and costly system integration delay in purchasing and shipping product difficulty with system integration via electronic data interchange and other process with our key supplier and customer and training and change management need of integration personnel these challenge have impacted our result of operation and may continue to do so in the future we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customer we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributor and partner we are selling multiple target market platform through their channel our operating result depend on sale within our partner network well the ability of these partner to sell product that incorporate our processor in the future these partner may decide to purchase fewer product not to incorporate our product into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing pattern in some other way because most of our sale are made on purchase order basis our customer can cancel change or delay product purchase commitment with little or no notice to and without penalty our partner or customer may develop their own solution our customer may purchase product from our competitor and our partner may discontinue sale or lose market share in the market for which they purchase our product all of which may alter partner or customer purchasing pattern the loss of any of our large customer significant reduction in purchase by them our inability to sell to customer due to or other country trade restriction or any difficulty in collecting account receivable would likely harm our financial condition and result of operation if we are unable to attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee our business may be harmed to be competitive and execute our business strategy successfully we must attract retain and motivate our executive and key employee and recruit and develop diverse talent labor is subject to external factor that are beyond our control including our industry highly competitive market for skilled worker and leader cost inflation the covid pandemic and workforce participation rate change in immigration and work permit regulation or in their administration or interpretation could impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employee competition for personnel result in increased cost in the form of cash and stock based compensation and in time of stock price volatility we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future the retentive value of our stock based compensation may decrease additionally we are highly dependent on the service of our longstanding executive team failure to ensure effective succession planning transfer of knowledge and smooth transition involving executive and key employee could hinder our strategic planning and execution and long term success our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon internal process and information system to support key business function including our assessment of internal control over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act the efficient operation and scalability of these process and system is critical to support our growth in fiscal year we continued the implementation of accounting and consolidation functionality related to new enterprise resource planning or erp system any erp system problem upon implementation such quality issue or programming error could impact our continued ability to successfully operate our business or to timely and accurately report our financial result these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time failure to implement new or updated control or difficulty encountered in their implementation could harm our operating result or cause to fail to meet our reporting obligation of contentsidentification of material weakness in our internal control even if quickly remediated disclosed may cause investor to lose confidence in our financial statement and our stock price may decline remediation of any material weakness could require to incur significant expense and if we fail to remediate any material weakness our financial statement may be inaccurate we may be required to restate our financial statement our ability to report our financial result on timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected our access to the capital market may be restricted our stock price may decline and we may be subject to sanction or investigation by regulatory authority the covid pandemic ha affected and could continue to have material adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation the covid pandemic ha impacted and may continue to impact our workforce and operation and those of our customer partner vendor and supplier covid related disruption have created and may continue to create supply chain and logistics constraint and covid containment around the world ha put restriction on among other area manufacturing facility commerce and support operation restriction may be imposed or reinstated the pandemic resurfaces such lockdown measure due to covid containment effort in china end customer sale for our product in china have been negatively impacted by lockdown and this impact may continue if lockdown return covid ha also resulted in and may continue to result in disruption of and volatility in global financial market which could impact overall technology spending or negatively affect our stock price and liquidity all of these factor have had or could in the future have material negative impact on our business we modified our business and workforce practice in response to covid including with respect to flexible work and social distancing measure and we may take further action required by government regulation or in the best interest of our employee customer partner and supplier these and other measure have caused and may in the future cause to incur incremental expense and cost the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our operational and financial performance and our ability to timely execute our business strategy may continue to be difficult to measure and predict the impact of covid can also exacerbate other risk discussed in these risk factor our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate and if our operating result are below the expectation of security analyst or investor our stock price could decline our operating result have in the past fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate due to numerous factor described in these risk factor therefore investor should not rely on past comparison of our result of operation an indication of our future performance additional factor that could affect our result of operation include but are not limited to our ability to adjust spending to offset revenue shortfall due to the multi year development cycle for some of our product and service our ability to comply with our customer contractual obligation our extended payment term arrangement with certain customer the inability of some customer to make required payment our ability to obtain credit insurance for these customer and their extended payment term and customer bad debt write offs our vendor payment requirement unanticipated cost associated with environmental liability and change in financial accounting standard or interpretation of existing standard any one or more of the factor discussed above could prevent from achieving our anticipated future financial result for example we have granted and may continue to grant extended payment term to some customer particularly during macroeconomic downturn which could impact our ability to collect payment our vendor have requested and may continue to ask for shorter payment term which may impact our cash flow generation these arrangement reduce the cash we have available for general business operation failure to meet our expectation or the expectation of our investor or security analyst is likely to cause our stock price to decline it ha in the past or experience substantial price volatility of contentsrisks related to regulatory legal our stock and other mattersour operation could be affected by the complex law rule and regulation to which our business is subject and political and other action may adversely impact our business we are subject to law and regulation domestically and worldwide affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement and tariff anti corruption including the foreign corrupt practice act business acquisition foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement competition and antitrust advertising employment product regulation cybersecurity environmental health and safety requirement the responsible use of ai climate change cryptocurrency and consumer law compliance with such requirement can be onerous and expensive could impact our competitive position and may negatively impact our business operation and ability to manufacture and ship our product there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier customer or agent will not violate applicable law or the policy control and procedure that we have designed to help ensure compliance with such law and violation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation change to the law rule and regulation to which we are subject or change to their interpretation and enforcement could lead to materially greater compliance and other cost and or further restriction on our ability to manufacture and supply our product and operate our business for example we may face increased compliance cost result of change or increase in anti competition legislation regulation administrative rule making increased focus from regulator on cybersecurity vulnerability and risk and enforcement activity resulting from growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporation revision to law or regulation or their interpretation and enforcement could also result in increased taxation trade sanction the imposition of or increase to import duty or tariff restriction and control on import or export or other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business plan or impact the timing of our shipment additionally change in the public perception of government in the region where we operate or plan to operate could negatively impact our business and result of operation government action including trade protection and national security policy of and foreign government body such tariff import or export regulation including deemed export restriction trade and economic sanction decree quota or other trade barrier and restriction could affect our ability to ship product provide service to our customer and employee do business without an export license with entity on the department of commerce entity list or other government restricted party list which is expected to change from time to time and generally fulfill our contractual obligation and have material adverse effect on our business if we were ever found to have violated export control law or sanction of the or similar applicable non law even if the violation occurred without our knowledge we may be subject to various penalty available under the law any of which could have material and adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition for example in response to the war in ukraine the united state and other jurisdiction imposed economic sanction and export control measure which blocked the passage of our product service and support into russia belarus and certain region of ukraine in fiscal year we stopped direct sale to russia and closed business operation in russia concurrently the war in ukraine ha impacted end customer sale in emea and may continue to do so in the future the increasing focus on the strategic importance of ai technology ha already resulted in regulatory restriction that target product and service capable of enabling or facilitating ai and may in the future result in additional restriction impacting some or all of our product and service offering such restriction could include additional unilateral or multilateral export control on certain product or technology including but not limited to ai technology geopolitical tension have increased semiconductor associated with ai including gpus and associated product are increasingly the focus of export control restriction proposed by stakeholder in the and it ally and it is likely that additional unilateral or multilateral control will be adopted such control may be broad in scope and application prohibit from exporting our product to any or all customer in one or more market including but not limited to china and could negatively impact our manufacturing testing and warehousing location and option or could impose other condition that limit our ability to serve demand abroad and could negatively and materially impact our business revenue and financial result export control targeting gpus and semiconductor associated with ai which are increasingly likely would restrict our ability to export our technology product or service even though competitor may not be subject to similar restriction creating competitive disadvantage for and of contentsnegatively impacting our business and financial result increasing use of economic sanction may also impact demand for our product or service negatively impacting our business and financial result additional unilateral or multilateral control are also likely to include deemed export control limitation that negatively impact the ability of our research and development team to execute our roadmap or other objective in timely manner additional export restriction may not only impact our ability to serve overseas market but also provoke response from foreign government including china that negatively impact our supply chain or our ability to provide our product and service to customer in all market worldwide which could also substantially reduce our revenue during the third quarter of fiscal year the government or usg announced new export restriction and export licensing requirement targeting china semiconductor and supercomputing industry these restriction impact export of certain chip well software hardware equipment and technology used to develop produce and manufacture certain chip to china including hong kong and macau and russia and specifically impact our and integrated circuit dgx or any other system or board which incorporate or integrated circuit and our the new license requirement also apply to any future nvidia integrated circuit achieving certain peak performance and chip to chip performance threshold well any system or board that includes those circuit there are also now licensing requirement to export wide array of product including networking product destined for certain end user and for certain end us in china we are required to transition certain operation of china including hong kong which could be costly and time consuming and adversely affect our research and development and supply and distribution operation well our revenue during any such transition period we have engaged with customer in china to provide alternative product not subject to the new license requirement such our new offering to the extent that customer requires product covered by the new license requirement we may seek license for the customer but have no assurance that the usg will grant any exemption or license for any customer or that the usg will act on them in timely manner the new requirement may have disproportionate impact on nvidia and may disadvantage nvidia against certain of our competitor who sell product that are not subject to the new restriction or may be able to acquire license for their product management of these new license and other requirement is complicated and time consuming our result and competitive position may be harmed if customer in china do not want to purchase our alternative product offering if customer purchase product from competitor if customer develop their own internal solution if we are unable to provide contractual warranty or other extended service obligation if the usg doe not grant license in timely manner or denies license to significant customer or if we incur significant transition cost additionally if we are unable to sell our alternative product offering in china we may have excess inventory harming our result even if the usg grant any requested license the license may be temporary or impose burdensome condition that we can not or choose not to fulfill the new requirement may benefit certain of our competitor the licensing process will make our pre sale and post sale technical support effort more cumbersome and le certain and encourage customer in china to pursue alternative to our product including semiconductor supplier based in china europe and israel additionally restriction imposed by the chinese government on the duration of gaming activity and access to game may adversely affect our gaming revenue and increased oversight of digital platform company may adversely affect our data center revenue increased scrutiny from shareholder regulator and others regarding our environmental social and governance responsibility could result in additional cost or risk and adversely impact our reputation and willingness of customer and supplier to do business with shareholder advocacy group certain investment fund other market participant shareholder and customer have placed increased importance on the implication of the social and environmental cost of their investment and these party well government regulator have focused increasingly on corporate esg and sustainability practice and disclosure including those associated with climate change and human right stakeholder may not be satisfied with our esg practice or the speed of their adoption additionally our esg practice oversight of esg practice or disclosure control may not meet evolving shareholder regulator or other industry stakeholder expectation or we may fail to meet sustainability disclosure or esg reporting standard we could also incur additional cost and require additional resource to monitor report and comply with various esg practice choose not to conduct business with potential of contentscustomers or discontinue or not expand business with existing customer due to our policy these factor may negatively harm our brand reputation and business activity or expose to liability issue relating to the responsible use of our technology including ai in our offering may result in reputational and financial harm and liability concern relating to the responsible use of new and evolving technology such ai in our product and service may result in reputational and financial harm and liability and may cause to incur cost to resolve such issue we are increasingly building ai capability into many of our product and service ai pose emerging ethical issue and present risk and challenge that could affect it adoption and therefore our business if we enable or offer solution that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society such ai solution that have unintended consequence or are controversial because of their impact on human right privacy employment or other social economic or political issue or if we are unable to develop effective internal policy and framework relating to the responsible development and use of ai model and system offered through our sale channel we may experience brand or reputational harm competitive harm or legal liability compliance with government regulation in the area of ai ethic may also increase the cost of related research and development and change in ai related regulation could disproportionately impact and disadvantage and require to change our business practice which may negatively impact our financial result our failure to address concern relating to the responsible use of ai by or others could undermine public confidence in ai and slow adoption of ai in our product and service or cause reputational harm action to adequately protect our ip right could result in substantial cost to and our ability to compete could be harmed if we are unsuccessful or if we are prohibited from making or selling our product from time to time we are involved in lawsuit or other legal proceeding alleging patent infringement or other ip right violation by our employee or party that we have agreed to indemnify an unfavorable ruling could include significant damage invalidation of one or more patent indemnification of third party payment of lost profit or injunctive relief claim that our product or process infringe the ip right of others regardless of their merit could cause to incur significant cost to respond to defend and resolve such claim and they may also divert the effort and attention of management and technical personnel we may commence legal proceeding to protect our ip right which may increase our operating expense we could be subject to countersuit result if infringement claim are made against or our product are found to infringe third party ip we or one of our indemnitees may have to seek license to the third party ip right if we or one of our indemnitees is unable to obtain such license on acceptable term or at all we could be subject to substantial liability or have to suspend or discontinue the manufacture and sale of one or more of our product we may also have to make royalty or other payment or cross license our technology if these arrangement are not concluded on commercially reasonable term our business could be negatively impacted furthermore the indemnification of customer or other indemnitee may increase our operating expense and negatively impact our operating result we rely on patent trademark trade secret employee and third party nondisclosure agreement licensing arrangement and the law of the country in which we operate to protect our ip foreign law may not protect our product or ip right to the same extent united state law this make the possibility of piracy of our technology and product more likely the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our product result the value of our investment in research and development product development and marketing could be reduced we also may face risk to our ip if our employee are hired by competitor we continuously ass whether and where to seek formal protection for existing and new innovation and technology but can not be certain whether our application for such protection will be approved and if approved whether they will be enforceable we are subject to stringent and changing data privacy and security law rule regulation and other obligation privacy or security concern relating to our product and service could damage our reputation deter current and potential customer or result in legal or regulatory proceeding and liability we may process sensitive confidential or personal data or information that is subject to privacy and security law regulation industry standard external and internal policy contract and other obligation that govern the processing of such data by and on our behalf concern about our practice or the ultimate use of contentsof our product and service with regard to the collection use retention security or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matter including for use in ai even if unfounded could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating result the theft loss or misuse of personal data in our possession or by one of our partner could result in damage to our reputation regulatory proceeding disruption of our business activity or increased security cost and cost related to defending legal claim in the united state federal state and local authority have enacted numerous data privacy and security law including for data breach notification personal data privacy and consumer protection the california consumer privacy act of or ccpa give california resident the right to access delete and opt out of certain sharing of their personal information and to receive detailed information about how it is used and shared the ccpa allows for statutory fine of up to per violation and the law created private right of action for certain data breach the california privacy right act of or cpra became operative in and restricts the use of certain category of sensitive personal information further restricts the use of cross contextual advertising technique restricts the retention of personal information expands the type of data breach subject to the private right of action and establishes the california privacy protection agency which can impose administrative fine for noncompliance virginia colorado utah and connecticut have each passed their own privacy legislation which differ from the cpra and each become effective in similar law are being considered in several other state well at the federal and local level additionally several state and locality have enacted measure related to the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in product and service if we become subject to additional data privacy law the risk of enforcement action against could increase worldwide regulatory authority are also considering and have approved various legislative proposal concerning data protection the european union adopted the general data protection regulation or gdpr and the united kingdom similarly adopted the gdpr governing the strict handling of personal data of person within the european economic area or eea and the united kingdom respectively including it use and protection and the ability of person whose data is stored to access correct and delete such data about if we are found not to comply we could be subject to penalty of up to million or of worldwide revenue whichever is greater and class of individual or consumer protection organization may initiate litigation related to our processing of their personal data furthermore there exists proposed european regulation related to ai that if adopted could impose onerous obligation that may disproportionately impact and disadvantage and require to change our business practice in the ordinary course of business we may transfer personal data from europe china and other jurisdiction to the united state or other country certain jurisdiction have enacted data localization law and cross border personal data transfer law for example the gdpr generally restricts the transfer of personal data to country outside of the eea the european commission released set of standard contractual clause designed for entity to validly transfer personal data out of the eea to jurisdiction that the european commission ha not found to provide an adequate level of protection including the united state while the european union and united state government have recently announced an agreement in principle on new bilateral cross border transfer mechanism it is uncertain whether this agreement will be overturned in court like the previous two european union united state bilateral cross border transfer agreement these mechanism are subject to legal challenge and there is no assurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measure to lawfully transfer personal data to the united state other jurisdiction have enacted or are considering similar cross border personal data transfer law and local personal data residency law any of which would increase the cost and complexity of doing business and could result in fine from regulator for example china law imposes various requirement relating to data processing and data localization data broadly defined important under china law including personal data may not be transferable outside of china without prior assessment and approval by the cyberspace administration of china or cac compliance with these requirement including cac assessment and any deemed failure of such assessment could cause to incur liability prevent from using data collected in china or impact our ability to transfer data outside of china the inability to import personal data to the united state could significantly and negatively impact our business operation limit our ability to collaborate with party that are subject to european china and other data privacy and security law or require to increase our personal data processing capability in europe and or elsewhere at significant expense some european regulator have prevented company from transferring personal data out of europe for allegedly violating the gdpr cross border data transfer limitation which could negatively impact our business we may also be bound by contractual obligation related to data privacy and security and our effort to comply with such obligation may not be successful or may be claimed to be non compliant for example of contentscertain privacy law such the gdpr and the ccpa require our customer to impose specific contractual restriction on their service provider we sometimes host personal data in collaboration with our customer and if breach exposed or altered that personal data it could harm those customer relationship and subject to litigation regulatory action or fine we may publish privacy policy marketing material and other statement such compliance with certain certification or self regulatory principle regarding data privacy and security if these policy material or statement are found to be deficient lacking in transparency deceptive unfair or misrepresentative of our practice we may be subject to investigation enforcement action by regulator or other adverse consequence data protection law around the world are quickly changing and may be interpreted and applied in an increasingly stringent fashion and in manner that is inconsistent with our data practice these obligation may necessitate change to our information technology system and practice and to those of any third party that process personal data on our behalf despite our effort we or third party upon we rely may fail to comply with such obligation if we fail or are perceived to have failed to address or comply with data privacy and security obligation we could face significant consequence including but not limited to government enforcement action litigation additional reporting requirement and or oversight ban on processing personal data and order to destroy or not use personal data any of these event could have material adverse effect on our reputation business or financial condition we have exposure to additional tax liability and our operating result may be adversely impacted by higher than expected tax rate and other tax related factor we are subject to complex income tax law and regulation well non income based tax in various jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability we are regularly under audit by tax authority in different jurisdiction for example we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for our fiscal year and and undergoing tax audit in germany israel and india although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable any adverse outcome could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation net income and cash flow further change in tax law may materially impact our result of operation or the way we conduct our business these include change to tax law and regulation such the inflation reduction act which implement minimum tax on book income and excise tax on net stock repurchase and part of which became effective for in fiscal year it is possible that these change or other tax law change could increase our future tax liability or cause other adverse impact most of our income is taxable in the united state with significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment foreign derived intangible income or fdii if tax rate increase or the fdii deduction is reduced our provision for income tax result of operation net income and cash flow would be adversely affected in addition change in the tax law of foreign jurisdiction could arise result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the organization for economic co operation and development or oecd the oecd recommended change to long standing tax principle and continues to develop new proposal including allocating greater taxing right to country where customer are located and establishing minimum tax on global income these change adopted by country may increase tax uncertainty and adversely affect our provision for income tax result of operation and financial condition our future effective tax rate may also be affected by variety of factor including change in our business or statutory rate the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate available tax incentive credit and deduction the expiration of statute of limitation and settlement of tax audit change in accounting principle adjustment to income tax upon finalization of tax return increase in expense not deductible for tax purpose the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability and deferred tax valuation allowance changing interpretation of existing law or regulation the impact of accounting for business combination well change in the domestic or international organization of our business and structure furthermore the tax effect of accounting for stock based compensation and volatility in our stock price may significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period in which they occur decline in our stock price may result in reduced future tax benefit from stock based compensation increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial result our business is exposed to the risk associated with litigation investigation and regulatory proceeding we currently and will likely continue to face legal administrative and regulatory proceeding claim demand and or investigation involving shareholder consumer competition and or other issue relating to of contentsour business for example we are defending on appeal the dismissal of security class action lawsuit from multiple shareholder asserting claim that we and certain of our officer made false and or misleading statement related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on gpu demand in and litigation and regulatory proceeding are inherently uncertain and adverse ruling could occur including monetary damage or fine or an injunction stopping from manufacturing or selling certain product engaging in certain business practice or requiring other remedy such compulsory licensing of patent an unfavorable outcome or settlement may result in material adverse impact regardless of the outcome litigation can be costly time consuming and disruptive to our operation our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and cash flow from operation and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation of january we had outstanding total of billion in note due by each series of senior note matures unless redeemed or repurchased we must repay or refinance the note if we decide to refinance we may receive le favorable term or we may be unable to refinance at all which may adversely affect our financial condition we also have million commercial paper program maintenance of our current and future indebtedness and contractual restriction could cause to dedicate substantial portion of our cash flow from operation towards debt service obligation and principal repayment increase our vulnerability to adverse change in general economic industry and competitive condition limit our flexibility regarding change in our business and our industry impair our ability to obtain future financing and restrict our ability to grant lien on property enter into certain merger dispose of our asset or materially change our business our ability to comply with the covenant in our indenture may be affected by event beyond our control if we breach any of the covenant without waiver from the note holder or lender then any outstanding indebtedness may be declared immediately due and payable change to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our security restrict our ability to obtain future financing and affect the term of any such financing delaware law and our certificate of incorporation bylaw and agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent change in control the anti takeover provision of the delaware general corporation law may discourage delay or prevent change in control provision in our certificate of incorporation and bylaw could make it more difficult for third party to acquire majority of our outstanding stock these provision include the ability of our board of director to create and issue preferred stock change the number of director and to make amend or repeal our bylaw without prior shareholder approval the inability of our shareholder to act by written consent or call special meeting advance notice requirement for director nomination and shareholder proposal and super majority voting requirement to amend some provision in our certificate of incorporation and bylaw under our agreement with microsoft for the xbox if someone make an offer to purchase at least of our outstanding common stock microsoft may have first and last right of refusal to purchase the stock these provision could delay or prevent change in

of consolidationour consolidated financial statement include the account of nvidia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ materially from our estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement cost restructuring and other charge and other contingency the input into our judgment and estimate consider the economic implication of covid these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable in february we completed an assessment of the useful life of our property plant and equipment based on advance in technology and usage rate we increased the estimated useful life of majority of the server storage and network equipment from three to range of four to five year and assembly and test equipment from five to seven year this change in accounting estimate became effective at the beginning of fiscal year based on the carrying amount of majority of our server storage network and assembly and test equipment net in use of the end of fiscal year it is estimated this change will increase our fiscal year operating income by million result of the reduction in depreciation expense revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and development arrangement software licensing and cloud service we determine revenue recognition through the following step identification of the contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract where revenue is allocated on relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable input to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and recognition of revenue when or we satisfy performance obligation product sale revenuerevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of product to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product certain product are of contentsnvidia corporation and

are recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed revenue is recognized net of allowance for return customer program and any tax collected from customer for product sold with right of return we record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return our customer program involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market and marketing development fund or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for customer program reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebate and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customer license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangement with customer typically require significant customization of our ip component result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development service single performance obligation over the period in which the development service are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if loss on an arrangement becomes probable during period we record provision for such loss in that period software licensingour software license provide our customer with right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customer may purchase either perpetual license or subscription to license which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefit from the software software license are frequently sold along with the right to receive on when and if available basis future unspecified software update and upgrade revenue from

subscription plus usage revenue related to subscription based cloud service is recognized ratably over the contract period revenue related to cloud service based on usage is recognized usage occurs product warrantieswe generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus and performance stock unit that are based on our corporate financial performance target or psus we use monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock unit that are based on market condition or market based psus the

method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeiture at least annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate litigation investigation and settlement costswe currently are and will likely continue to be subject to claim litigation and other action including potential regulatory proceeding involving patent and other intellectual property matter tax labor and employment competition and antitrust commercial dispute good and service offered by and by third party and other matter there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment or judgment if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different

revenue and expense are remeasured at exchange rate in effect during each period except for those expense related to non monetary balance sheet amount which are remeasured at historical exchange rate gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement are included in earnings in our consolidated statement of income and to date have not been significant income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of billion related to capital loss carryforwards state and certain other deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projection of future taxable income including capital gain tax attribute usage limitation by certain jurisdiction and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to
