compensate for loss of patent term due to delay in product approval due to the regulatory requirement one of the primary consideration in limiting our operation in some country outside the is the lack

additional information see the item business government regulation and price constraint section in this form in various market period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided for drug upon approval the scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but in general the period will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent right associated with the drug at the time of approval based on

remaining generic company in august the district court for the district of delaware decided that the two challenged eliquis patent are both valid and infringed by the remaining generic company the remaining generic company have appealed the delaware court decision and the final decision in this case could determine when generic version of eliquis will come on the market while we can not predict the outcome of this pending litigation these are the alternative that might occur if the district court decision is upheld in the current appeal with respect to both patent under the term of previously executed settlement agreement with the settled generic company the permitted date of launch for the settled generic company under these patent is april if the formulation patent is held invalid or not infringed in the current appeal the settled generic company and the remaining generic company would be permitted to launch on november or if both patent are held invalid or not infringed in the current appeal the settled generic company and the remaining generic company could launch product immediately upon such an adverse decision in addition both patent may be subject to subsequent challenge by party other than the remaining generic company if this were to occur depending on the outcome of the subsequent challenge the potential launch by generic company including

patent bavencio is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with merck kgaa the loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property right patent litigation settlement with manufacturer and the expiration of co promotion and licensing right can have significant adverse effect on our revenue once patent protection ha expired or ha been lost prior to the expiration date result of legal challenge we typically lose exclusivity on these product and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturer generally produce identical or highly similar product and sell them for lower price the date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires however when generic or biosimilar competition doe commence the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenue for the impacted product often in short period of time also if one of our product related patent is found to be invalid by judicial court or regulatory or administrative proceeding generic or biosimilar product could be introduced resulting in the erosion of sale of our existing product we continue to vigorously defend our patent right against infringement and we will continue to support effort that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent right while taking necessary step to help ensure appropriate patient access

for long it is registered protecting our trademark is of material importance to pfizer competitionour business is conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated market many of our product face competition in the form of branded or generic drug or biosimilars that treat similar disease or indication the principal form of competition include efficacy safety ease of use and cost though the mean of competition vary among our product demonstrating the value of our product is critical factor for success we compete with other company that manufacture and sell product that treat disease or indication similar to those treated by our major product these competitor include other worldwide research based biopharmaceutical company smaller research company with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drug manufacturer our competitor also may devote substantial fund and resource to and their successful could result in erosion of the sale of our existing product and potential sale of product in development well unanticipated product obsolescence in addition several of our competitor operate without large expense and make regular practice of challenging our product patent their expiration to address competitive trend we continually emphasize innovation which is underscored by our multi billion dollar investment in well our business development transaction both designed to result in strong product pipeline our investment in research continues even after drug approval we seek to further demonstrate the value of our product for the condition they treat well potential new application we educate patient physician payer and global health authority on the benefit and risk of our medicine and seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of our biopharmaceutical function including to accurately and ethically launch and market our product to our customer operating condition have also shifted result of increased global competitive pressure industry regulation and cost containment we continue to evaluate adapt and improve our organization and business practice in an effort to better meet customer and public need we believe that we have taken an industry leading role in evolving our approach to direct to consumer advertising interaction with and payment to healthcare professional and medical

solution our vaccine may face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccine or next generation vaccine prior to or after the expiration of their patent which may adversely affect our future result our biosimilars compete with branded product from competitor well other generic and biosimilars manufacturer we sell biosimilars of certain inflammation immunology and oncology biologic medicine we seek to maximize the opportunity to establish first to market or early market position for our biosimilars to provide customer lower cost alternative immediately when available and also to potentially provide with higher level of sale and profitability other competitor enter the market pfizer inc form product generic pharmaceutical manufacturer pose one of the biggest competitive challenge to our branded small molecule product they can market competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much le several competitor regularly challenge our product patent before their expiration generic competitor often operate without large expense well without cost of conveying medical information about product to the medical community in addition the fda approval process exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product in china for example we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturer in and beyond which may result in price cut and volume loss of some of our product in addition generic version of competitor branded product may also compete with our product mcos that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drug often favor generic over brand name drug many government also encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program including medicaid in the and law generally allow and in some case require pharmacist to substitute generic drug for brand name drug in small subset of state prescribing physician are able to expressly prevent such substitution biosimilars certain of our biologic product including enbrel we market enbrel outside the and canada already face or may face in the future competition from biosimilars also referred to follow on biologics biosimilars are version of biologic medicine that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in term of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful difference in safety purity or potency biosimilars have the potential to offer high quality lower cost alternative to innovative biologic medicine in the biosimilars referencing innovative biologic product are approved under the public health service act pricing pressure and managed care organizationspricing pressure pricing and access pressure in the commercial sector continue to be significant overall there is increasing pressure on provider to deliver healthcare at lower cost and to ensure that those expenditure deliver demonstrated value in term of health outcome many employer have adopted high deductible health plan which can increase out of pocket cost for medicine this trend is likely to continue private third party payer such health plan increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing which could result in lower price lower reimbursement rate and reduction in demand for our product pricing pressure also may occur result of highly competitive insurance market healthcare provider purchaser directly or through group purchasing organization are seeking enhanced discount or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review process longer term we foresee shift in focus away from fee for service payment towards outcome based payment and risk sharing arrangement that reward provider for cost reduction and improved patient outcome these new payment model can at time lead to lower price for and restricted access to new medicine at the time these model can also promote utilization of drug by encouraging physician to screen and diagnose and consider drug mean of forestalling more costly medical intervention we believe medicine are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollar based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system we work with law maker and advocate for solution that effectively improve patient health outcome lower cost to the healthcare system and help ensure access to medicine within an efficient and affordable healthcare system in addition in response to the evolving and global healthcare spending landscape we work with health authority health technology assessment and quality measurement body and major payer throughout the product development process to better understand how these entity value our compound and product further we seek to develop stronger internal capability focused on demonstrating the value of the medicine that we discover or develop register and manufacture by recognizing pattern of usage of our medicine and competitor medicine along with pattern of healthcare cost for information on government pricing pressure see the item business government regulation and price constraint and item risk factor pricing and reimbursement section in this form managed care organization the evolution of managed care in the ha been major factor in the competitiveness of the healthcare marketplace approximately million people in the now have some form of health insurance coverage and the marketing of prescription drug to both consumer and the entity that manage coverage in the continues to grow in importance in particular the influence of mcos ha increased in recent year due to the growing number of patient receiving coverage through mcos at the same time consolidation in the mco industry ha resulted in fewer even larger entity which enhances mcos ability to negotiate pricing and increase their importance to our business since mcos seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditure their growing influence ha increased pressure on drug price well revenue mcos typically negotiate price with pharmaceutical provider by using formulary which are list of approved medicine available to mco member clinical protocol which require prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or more generic product before permitting access to branded medicine volume purchasing long term contract and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drug in addition by placing branded medicine on higher tier or non preferred status in their formulary mcos transfer portion of the cost to the patient resulting in significant patient out of pocket expense this financial disincentive is tool for mcos to manage drug cost and channel patient to medicine preferred by the mcos the aca ha accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across mcos and other stakeholder in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing cost which creates pressure on mcos to tie reimbursement to defined outcome we are closely monitoring these newer approach and developing appropriate strategy to respond to them the breadth of the product covered by formulary can vary considerably from one mco to another and many formulary include alternative and competitive product for treatment of particular medical problem mcos also emphasize primary and preventive care out patient treatment and procedure performed at doctor office and clinic way to manage cost hospitalization and surgery typically the most expensive form of treatment are carefully managed and drug that can reduce the need for hospitalization professional therapy or surgery may become favored first line treatment for certain disease pfizer inc form of product from formulary or other mco implemented restriction can significantly impact drug usage in the mco patient population and beyond consequently pharmaceutical company compete to gain access to formulary for their product typically on the basis of unique product feature such greater efficacy better patient ease of use or fewer side effect well the overall cost of the therapy we have been generally although not universally successful in having our major product included on mco formulary however increasingly our branded product are being placed on the higher tier or in non preferred status for additional information see the item risk factor managed care trend section in this form raw materialswe procure raw material essential to our business from numerous supplier worldwide in general these material have been available in sufficient quantity to support our demand and in many case are available from multiple supplier we have supplier management activity in place to monitor supply channel and to take action needed to secure necessary volume no significant impact to our operation due to the availability of raw material is currently anticipated in government regulation and price constraintswe are subject to extensive regulation by government authority in the country in which we do business this includes law and regulation governing pharmaceutical company such the approval manufacturing and marketing of

the marketing of prescription drug under state consumer protection and false advertising law healthcare reform any significant effort at the federal or state level to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have material impact on this includes potential replacement for the aca if it is ultimately invalidated by the supreme court in california texas well effort at the state level to develop additional public insurance option or implement single payer healthcare system we do not expect that invalidation of the aca would have material impact on our business given the modest revenue the health insurance exchange and medicaid expansion generate for however future replacement of the aca or other healthcare reform effort may adversely affect our business and financial result particularly if such replacement or reform reduces incentive for employer sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increase industry tax and fee pfizer inc form and reimbursement pricing and reimbursement for our product depend in part on government regulation in order to have our product covered by medicaid we must offer discount or rebate on purchase of pharmaceutical product under various federal and state program we also must report specific price to government agency the calculation necessary to determine the price reported are complex and the failure to do so accurately may expose to enforcement measure see the discussion regarding rebate in the analysis of the consolidated statement of income revenue by geography section within md and note government and private payer routinely seek to manage utilization and control the cost of our product and there is considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing effort by state and the federal government to regulate price or payment for pharmaceutical product including proposed action to facilitate drug importation limit reimbursement to lower international reference price require deep discount and require manufacturer to report and make public price increase and sometimes written justification for the increase could adversely affect our business if implemented in the fall of the trump administration finalized an importation pathway from canada and payment model to tie medicare part physician reimbursement to international price though ultimate implementation of both is uncertain due to legal challenge we expect to see continued focus on regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation under the newly elected congress and the biden administration in addition government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement program including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our product or service associated with the provision of our product for additional information see the item risk factor pricing and reimbursement section in this form majority of state use preferred drug list to manage access to pharmaceutical product under medicaid including some of our product for example access to our product under the medicaid and medicare managed care program typically is determined by the health plan with which state medicaid agency and medicare contract to provide service to beneficiary state seek to control healthcare cost related to medicaid and other state healthcare program including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreement under the medicaid drug rebate program tied to patient outcome in addition we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chain wholesaler and pbms will increase pricing pressure in the industry for additional information see the item risk factor managed care trend section in this form anti corruption the fcpa prohibits corporation and their representative from offering promising authorizing or making payment to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interaction with certain healthcare professional in many country other country have enacted similar anti corruption law and or regulation data privacy the collection and use of personal data by part of our business activity is subject to various federal and state privacy and data security law and regulation including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental body such law and regulation have the potential to affect our business materially continue to evolve and are increasingly being enforced vigorously outside the united stateswe encounter similar regulatory and legislative issue in most country outside the new drug approval in the eu the ema conduct the scientific evaluation supervision and safety monitoring of our innovative medicinal product and employ centralized procedure for approval for the eu and the european economic area eea country from january consequence of the leaving the eu brexit the medicine and healthcare product regulatory agency is the sole regulatory authority for the in china following significant regulatory reform in recent year the nmpa is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicine in japan the pmda is involved in wide range of regulatory activity including clinical study approval post marketing review and pharmaceutical safety health authority in many middle and lower income require marketing approval by recognized regulatory authority the fda or ema before they begin to conduct their application review process and or issue their final approval pharmacovigilance in the eu eea the ema pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee is responsible for reviewing and making recommendation on product safety issue outside developed market pharmacovigilance requirement vary and are generally not extensive but there is trend toward increasing regulation pricing and reimbursement certain government including in the different eu member state the china japan canada and south korea provide healthcare at low to zero direct cost to consumer at the point of care and have significant power to regulate pharmaceutical price or patient reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system particularly under recent global financing pressure government may use variety of measure including proposing price reform or legislation cross country collaboration and procurement price cut mandatory rebate health technology assessment forced localization condition of market access international reference pricing the practice of country linking it regulated medicine price to those of other country qce process and vbp in addition the international patchwork of price regulation differing economic condition and incomplete value assessment across country ha led to varying access to quality medicine in many market and some third party trade in our product between country several important multilateral organization such the world health organization and the organization for economic cooperation and development are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing report and policy recommendation on november the european commission published it new pharmaceutical strategy for europe which envisions broad range of new initiative and legislation including significant focus on affordability and access to medicine in china pricing pressure have increased in recent year with government official emphasizing improved health outcome healthcare reform and decreased drug price key indicator of progress towards reform drug price have decreased dramatically result of adding innovative drug including oncology medicine to the national reimbursement drug list nrdl in the off patent space numerous local generic have been officially deemed bioequivalent under qce process that required domestically manufactured generic drug to pas test to ass their bioequivalence to qualified reference drug typically the originator drug centralized vbp program ha also been initiated and expanded nationwide under which tender process ha been established where certain portion of included molecule volume are guaranteed to tender winner the program is intended to contain healthcare cost by driving utilization of generic that have passed qce which ha resulted in dramatic price cut for off patent medicine furthermore the chinese government ha discussed moving toward effort to unify the reimbursement price between qce approved generic medicine and the applicable original medicine which the government currently plan to pfizer inc form within the next few year we and most off patent originator have mostly not been successful in the vbp bidding process the government ha indicated that additional post loe drug could be subjected to qce qualification in future round which could also be tied to volume based procurement while certain detail of future qce expansion have been made available we are unable to determine the impact on our business and financial condition until the initiation of these future round healthcare provider transparency and disclosure several country have implemented law requiring or their industry association have recommended disclosure of transfer of value made by pharmaceutical company to healthcare provider intellectual property reliable patent protection and enforcement around the world are among the key factor we consider for continued business and investment the world trade organization agreement on trade related aspect of intellectual property right wto trip requires participant country to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical product by law with an exemption provided for least developed country until while some country have made improvement we still face patent grant enforcement and other intellectual property challenge in many country while the global intellectual property environment ha generally improved following wto trip and bilateral multilateral trade agreement our growth and ability to bring new product innovation to patient depends on further progress in intellectual property protection in certain developed international market government maintain relatively effective intellectual property policy however in the eu following review of pharmaceutical intellectual property and regulatory incentive legislative change may result in the reduction of certain protection in several emerging market country government have used intellectual property policy tool to force innovator to accept le than fair value for medicine well to advance industrial policy and localization goal considerable political and economic pressure ha weakened current intellectual property protection in some country and ha led to policy such more restrictive standard for obtaining patent and more difficult procedure for patenting biopharmaceutical invention restriction on patenting certain type of invention revocation of patent law or regulation that promote or provide broad discretion to issue compulsory license weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection our industry advocacy effort focus on seeking fair and transparent business environment for foreign manufacturer underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property system for local innovative industry and helping improve patient access to innovative medicine data privacy outside of the many country have privacy and data security law and regulation concerning the collection and

prospect reputation or credit rating could be adversely affected now and in the future potentially in material way the following discussion of risk factor contains forward looking statement discussed in the forward looking information and factor that may affect future result section in this form pfizer inc form related to our business industry and operation managed care trendsprivate payer such health plan and other managed care entity such pbms continue to take action to manage the utilization and cost of drug negotiating power of mcos and other private third party payer ha increased due to consolidation and they along with government increasingly employ formulary to control cost and encourage utilization of certain drug including through the use of formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement these initiative have increased consumer interest and input in medication choice they pay for larger portion of their prescription cost and may cause them to favor lower cost generic alternative we may fail to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing or formulary placement of our product or fail to obtain such formulary placement at favorable pricing the growing availability and use of innovative specialty pharmaceutical medicine that treat rare or life threatening condition which typically have smaller patient population combined with their relative higher cost compared to other type of pharmaceutical product also ha generated increased payer interest in developing cost containment strategy targeted to this sector third party payer also use additional measure such new to market block exclusion list indication based pricing and value based pricing contracting to improve their cost containment effort and are also increasingly imposing utilization management tool such clinical protocol requiring prior authorization for branded product if generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic product before permitting access to branded medicine the private third party payer market consolidates further and more drug become available in generic form we may face greater pricing pressure from private third party payer they continue to drive more of their patient to use lower cost generic alternative business arrangement in this area are subject to high degree of government scrutiny and available safe harbor under applicable federal and state fraud and abuse law are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action well evolving judicial interpretation our approach to these arrangement may also be informed by such government and industry guidance competitive productscompetitive product launch may erode future sale of our product including our existing product and those currently under development or result in unanticipated product obsolescence such launch have recently occurred and potentially competitive product are in various stage of development we can not predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive product that treat disease and condition like those treated by our in line drug and drug candidate in addition competition from manufacturer of generic drug including from generic version of competitor branded product that lose their market exclusivity is major challenge for our branded product certain of our product have experienced significant generic competition over the last few year for example the basic product patent for chantix in the expired in november while multi source generic competition for chantix ha not yet begun it could commence at anytime also the basic product patent for sutent in the will expire in august in china we expect to continue to face intense competition by certain generic manufacturer which may result in price cut and volume loss of some of our product in addition our patented product may face generic competition before patent exclusivity expires including upon the at risk launch despite pending patent infringement litigation against the generic product by manufacturer of generic version of one of our patented product generic manufacturer have filed application with the fda seeking approval of product candidate that they claim do not infringe our patent or claim that our patent are not valid these include candidate that would compete with among other product eliquis ibrance and xeljanz our licensing and collaboration partner also face challenge by generic drug manufacturer to patent covering product for which we have license or co promotion right we may become subject to competition from biosimilars referencing our biologic product if competitor are able to obtain marketing approval for such biosimilars we also commercialize biosimilar product that compete with product of others including other biosimilar product uptake of our biosimilars may be lower due to various factor such anti competitive practice access challenge where our product may not receive appropriate coverage reimbursement access or remains in disadvantaged position relative to an innovator product physician reluctance to prescribe biosimilars for existing patient taking the innovative product or misaligned financial incentive for example inflectra ha experienced access challenge among commercial payer in september pfizer filed suit in the district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania against alleging that exclusionary contract and other anticompetitive practice concerning remicade infliximab violate federal antitrust law for additional information on competition our product face see the item business competition section in this form concentrationwe recorded direct product and or alliance revenue of more than billion for each of seven product that collectively accounted for of our total revenue in for additional information see note and if these product or any of our other major product were to experience loss of patent protection if applicable change in prescription growth rate material product liability litigation unexpected side effect or safety concern regulatory proceeding negative publicity affecting doctor or patient confidence pressure from existing competitive product change in labeling pricing and access pressure or supply shortage or if new more effective treatment should be introduced the adverse impact on our revenue could be significant in particular certain of our product have experienced patent based expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain market in the last few year and patent covering number of our best selling product are or have been the subject of pending legal challenge for additional information on our patent see the item business patent and other intellectual property right section in this form pfizer inc form addition we sell our prescription pharmaceutical product principally through wholesaler in the for additional information see note if one of our significant biopharmaceutical wholesaler should encounter financial or other difficulty it might decrease the amount of business the wholesaler doe with and or we might be unable to timely collect all the amount that the wholesaler owes or at all which could negatively impact our result of operation in addition we expect that consolidation and integration of pharmacy chain and wholesaler will increase competitive and pricing pressure on pharmaceutical manufacturer including research and development the discovery and development of new product well the development of additional us for existing product are necessary for the continued strength of our business our product line must be replenished over time to offset revenue loss when product lose exclusivity or market share well to provide for earnings growth either through internal or through collaboration acquisition jv licensing or other arrangement growth depends in large part on our ability to identify and develop new product or new indication for existing product that address unmet medical need and receive reimbursement from payer however balancing current growth investment for future growth and the delivery of shareholder return remains major challenge the cost of product development continue to be high are regulatory requirement in many therapeutic area which may affect the number of candidate we are able to fund well the sustainability of the portfolio decision made early in the development process of drug or vaccine candidate can have substantial impact on the marketing strategy and payer reimbursement possibility if the candidate receives regulatory approval we try to plan clinical trial prudently and to reasonably anticipate and address challenge but there is no assurance that an optimal balance between trial conduct speed and desired outcome will be achieved additionally our product candidate can fail at any stage of the process and may not receive regulatory approval even after many year of we may fail to correctly identify indication for which our science is promising or allocate investment resource efficiently and failure to invest in the right technology platform therapeutic area product class geographic market and or licensing opportunity could adversely impact the productivity of our pipeline further even if we identify area with the greatest commercial potential the scientific approach may not succeed despite the significant investment required for and the product may not be competitive expected because of the highly dynamic market environment and the hurdle in term of access and reimbursement global operationswe operate on global scale and could be affected by currency fluctuation capital and exchange control global economic condition expropriation and other restrictive government action change in intellectual property legal protection and remedy trade regulation and procedure and action affecting approval production pricing and marketing of reimbursement for and access to our product well by political or civil unrest terrorist activity unstable government and legal system and inter governmental dispute some emerging market country may be particularly vulnerable to period of financial or political instability or significant currency fluctuation or may have limited resource for healthcare spending result of these and other factor our strategy to grow in emerging market may not be successful and growth rate in these market may not be sustainable in addition since significant portion of our business is conducted in the eu well the the change resulting from brexit may pose certain implication for our research commercial and general business operation in the and the eu government financing and economic pressure can lead to negative pricing pressure in various market where government take an active role in setting price access criterion through health technology assessment or other mean of cost control for additional information on government pricing pressure see the item business government regulation and price constraint section in this form we continue to monitor the global trade environment and potential trade conflict and impediment that could impact our business if trade restriction or tariff reduce global economic activity potential impact could include declining sale increased cost volatility in foreign exchange rate decline in the value of our financial asset and pension plan investment required increase of our pension funding obligation increased government cost control effort delay or failure in the performance of customer supplier and other third party on we may depend for the performance of our business and the risk that our allowance for doubtful account may not be adequate we operate in many country and transact in over different currency change in the value of those currency relative to the dollar or high inflation in these country can impact our revenue cost and expense and our financial guidance significant portion of our revenue cost and expense well our substantial international net asset are exposed to exchange rate change of our total revenue were derived from international operation including from europe and from china japan and the rest of asia future change in exchange rate or economic condition and the impact they may have on our result of operation financial condition or business are difficult to predict for additional information about our exposure to foreign currency risk see the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resource and market risk selected measure of liquidity and capital resource section within md in addition our borrowing pension benefit and postretirement benefit obligation and interest bearing investment are subject to risk from change in interest and exchange rate the risk related to interest bearing investment and borrowing and the measure we have taken to help contain them are discussed in the analysis of financial condition liquidity capital resource and market risk selected measure of liquidity and capital resource section within md for additional detail on critical accounting estimate and assumption for our benefit plan see the significant accounting policy and application of critical accounting estimate and assumption benefit plan section within md and note and from time to time we issue variable rate debt based on libor or undertake interest rate swap that contain variable element based on libor the financial conduct authority announced in that it will no longer compel bank to submit rate that are currently used to calculate libor after this deadline wa extended until june for number of key dollar benchmark maturity including the month and month libor rate the federal reserve ha selected the secured overnight funding rate sofr the preferred alternate rate and the transition away from libor will continue despite the extended timeline we are planning for this transition and will amend pfizer inc form contract to accommodate the sofr rate where required while our exposure to libor is very low market volatility related to the transition may adversely affect the trading market for security linked to such benchmark product manufacturing sale and marketing riskswe could encounter difficulty or delay in product manufacturing sale or marketing due to regulatory action shut down work stoppage or strike approval delay withdrawal recall penalty supply disruption shortage or stock out reputational harm damage to our facility due to natural or man made disaster product liability or unanticipated cost example of such difficulty or delay include the inability to increase production capacity commensurate with demand challenge related to component material to maintain appropriate quality standard throughout our supply network and or comply with applicable regulation and supply chain disruption at our facility or at supplier or vendor regulatory agency periodically inspect our manufacturing facility to evaluate compliance with cgmp or other applicable requirement failure to comply with these requirement may subject to possible legal or regulatory action such warning letter suspension of manufacturing seizure of product injunction debarment product recall delay or denial of product approval import ban or denial of import certification for example in september our subsidiary meridian received warning letter from the fda asserting the fda view that certain violation of cgmp and quality system regulation exist at meridian manufacturing site in st louis missouri and classifying the site official action indicated oai meridian responded to the warning letter and committed to making improvement across the site we have made considerable progress addressing the concern raised by the fda and communication with the fda is ongoing future fda inspection and regulatory activity will further ass the adequacy and sustainability of these correction implemented at the site result of the oai classification the fda may refuse to grant premarket approval of application and or the fda may refuse to grant export certificate related to product manufactured at our st louis site collaboration and other relationship with third party we depend on third party collaborator service provider and others in the research development manufacturing and commercialization of our product and product candidate and also enter into jv and other business development transaction to achieve expected longer term benefit we may make substantial upfront payment part of these transaction which may negatively impact our reported earnings or cash flow we rely heavily on these party for multiple aspect of our drug development manufacturing and commercialization activity but we do not control many aspect of those activity we also outsource certain service including activity related to transaction processing accounting information technology manufacturing clinical trial recruitment and execution clinical lab service non clinical research safety service integrated facility management and other area failure by one or more of the third party collaborator service provider and others to complete activity on schedule or in accordance with our expectation or to meet their contractual or other obligation to failure of one or more of these party to comply with applicable law or regulation or any disruption in the relationship between and these party could delay or prevent the development approval manufacturing or commercialization of our product and product candidate expose to suboptimal quality of service delivery or deliverable result in repercussion such missed deadline or other timeliness issue erroneous data and supply disruption and could also result in non compliance with legal or regulatory requirement or industry standard or subject to reputational harm all with potential negative implication for our product pipeline and business further our alliance revenue will be adversely affected by the termination or expiration of collaboration and co promotion agreement that we have entered into and that we may enter into from time to time counterfeit productsour reputation and promising pipeline render our medicine prime target for counterfeiter counterfeit medicine pose significant risk to patient health and safety because of the condition under which they are manufactured often in unregulated unlicensed uninspected and unsanitary site well the lack of regulation of their content failure to mitigate this threat could adversely impact our business by among other thing causing patient harm the loss of patient confidence in the pfizer name and in the integrity of our medicine potentially resulting in lost sale product recall and an increased threat of litigation the prevalence of counterfeit medicine is an industry wide issue due to variety of factor including the adoption of commerce which increased during the covid pandemic greatly enhancing consumer ability to obtain prescription and other medical treatment via the internet in lieu of traditional brick and mortar pharmacy the internet expose patient to greater risk it is preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offer and scam because of the anonymity it affords counterfeiter we consistently invest in an enterprise wide strategy to aggressively combat counterfeit threat by educating patient and health care provider about the risk proactively monitoring and interdicting supply with the help of law enforcement and advising legislator and regulator however our effort and those of others may not be entirely successful and the presence of counterfeit medicine may continue to increase risk related to government regulation and legal proceeding pricing and reimbursementu and international governmental regulation that mandate price control or limitation on patient access to our product or establish price paid by government entity or program for our product impact our business and our future result could be adversely affected by change in such regulation or policy the adoption of restrictive price control in new jurisdiction more restrictive control in existing jurisdiction or the failure to obtain or maintain timely or adequate pricing could also adversely impact revenue we expect pricing pressure will continue globally in the pharmaceutical product pricing is subject to government and public scrutiny and call for reform and many of our product are subject to increasing pricing pressure result some state have implemented and others are considering price control or patient access constraint under the medicaid program and some are considering measure that would apply to broader segment of their population that are not medicaid eligible state legislature also have recently focused on addressing drug cost generally by increasing price transparency or limiting drug price increase measure to regulate price or payment for pharmaceutical product including legislation on drug importation pfizer inc form adversely affect our business for additional information on pricing and reimbursement see the item business government regulation and price constraint section in this form we encounter similar regulatory and legislative issue in most other country in which we operate in certain market such in eu member state the china japan canada and south korea government have significant power large single payer to regulate price access criterion or impose other mean of cost control particularly result of recent global financing pressure for example the qce and vbp tender process in china ha resulted in dramatic price cut for off patent medicine for additional information regarding these government initiative see the item business government regulation and price constraint section in this form we anticipate that these and similar initiative will continue to increase pricing pressure in china and elsewhere in the future in addition in many country with respect to our vaccine we participate in tender process for selection in national immunization program failure to secure participation in national immunization program or to obtain acceptable pricing in the tender process could adversely affect our business we also anticipate pricing pressure will be amplified by covid induced budget deficit and focus on pricing for new covid therapy and vaccine healthcare reformthe healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial change any significant effort at the federal or state level to reform the healthcare system by changing the way healthcare is provided or funded could have material impact on for additional information on healthcare reform see the item business government regulation and price constraint section in this form other federal or state legislative or regulatory action and or policy effort could adversely affect our business including among others general budget control action change in patent law the importation of prescription drug to the at price that are regulated by foreign government revision to reimbursement of biopharmaceuticals under government program that could reference international price or require new discount restriction on direct to consumer advertising limitation on interaction with healthcare professional and other industry stakeholder or the use of comparative effectiveness methodology that could be implemented in manner that focus primarily on cost difference and minimizes the therapeutic difference among pharmaceutical product and restricts access to innovative medicine reduction of federal spending on entitlement program including medicare and medicaid may affect payment for our product or service provided using our product the congressional budget office routinely release option for reducing federal spending that could affect pharmaceutical utilization and pricing doe the medicare payment advisory commission these and any other significant spending reduction or cost control affecting medicare medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health program that may be implemented could have an adverse impact on our result of operation development regulatory approval and marketing of productsthe discovery and development of drug and biological product are time consuming costly and unpredictable the outcome is inherently uncertain and involves high degree of risk due to the following factor among others the process from early discovery to design and adequate implementation of clinical trial to regulatory approval can take many year product candidate can and do fail at any stage of the process including the result of unfavorable pre clinical and clinical trial result or unfavorable new pre clinical or clinical data and further analysis of existing pre clinical or clinical data including result that may not support further clinical development of the product candidate or indication we may not be able to meet anticipated pre clinical or clinical endpoint commencement and or completion date for our pre clinical or clinical trial regulatory submission date regulatory approval date and or launch date we may not be able to successfully address all the comment received from regulatory authority such the fda and the ema or be able to obtain approval from regulator regulatory approval of our product depend on myriad factor including regulator making determination to whether product is safe and efficacious in the context of public health emergency like the covid pandemic regulator evaluate various factor and criterion to potentially allow for marketing authorization on an emergency basis additionally clinical trial and other product data are subject to differing interpretation and assessment by regulatory authority result of regulatory interpretation and assessment or other development that occur during the review process and even after product is authorized or approved for marketing product commercial potential could be adversely affected by potential emerging concern or regulatory decision regarding or impacting labeling or marketing manufacturing process safety and or other matter we may not be able to receive or maintain favorable recommendation by technical or advisory committee such the acip that may impact the use of our product further claim and concern that may arise regarding the safety and efficacy of in line product and product candidate can negatively impact product sale and potentially lead to product recall or withdrawal and or consumer fraud product liability and other litigation and claim further regulatory agency requirement may result in more challenging expensive and lengthy regulatory approval process than anticipated due to request for among other thing additional or more extensive clinical trial prior to granting approval or increased post approval requirement for these and other reason discussed in this risk factor section we may not obtain the approval we expect within the timeframe we anticipate or at all post approval dataas condition to granting marketing authorization or approval of product the fda may require additional clinical trial or other study the result generated in these trial could result in the loss of marketing approval change in labeling and or new or increased concern about the side effect efficacy or safety regulatory agency in country outside the often have similar regulation and may impose comparable requirement post marketing study whether conducted by or by others whether mandated by regulatory agency or conducted voluntarily and other emerging data about product such adverse event report may also adversely affect the availability or commercial potential of our product further if safety or efficacy concern are raised about product in the same class one of our product those concern could implicate the entire class and this in turn could have an adverse impact on the availability or commercial viability of our product well pfizer inc form product in the class the potential regulatory and commercial implication of post marketing study result for approved indication and potential new indication of an in line product typically can not immediately be determined for example the potential impact of the co primary endpoint result from recently completed post marketing required safety study of xeljanz oral surveillance announced in january and related result analysis and discussion with and review by regulator remain uncertain we are working with the fda and other regulatory agency to review the full result and analysis they become available the term of our eua for the vaccine require that we conduct post authorization observational study in addition the fda expects eua holder to work towards submission of full application such bla soon possible legal matterswe are and may be involved in various legal proceeding including patent litigation product liability and other product related litigation including personal injury consumer off label promotion security antitrust and breach of contract claim commercial environmental government investigation employment tax litigation and other legal proceeding that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdict do occur although we believe that our claim and defense in matter in which we are defendant are substantial we could in the future incur judgment enter into settlement or revise our expectation regarding the outcome of certain matter and such development could have material adverse effect on our result of operation claim against our patent include challenge to the coverage and or validity of our patent on various product or process there can be no assurance to the outcome of these matter and loss in any of these case could result in loss of patent protection for the product at issue which could lead to significant loss of sale of that product and could materially affect future result of operation government investigation and action could result in substantial fine and or criminal charge and civil penalty limitation on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdiction corporate integrity or deferred prosecution agreement and other disciplinary action well reputational harm including result of increased public interest in the matter in addition in qui tam lawsuit in which the government decline to intervene the relator may still pursue suit for the recovery of civil damage and penalty on behalf of the government our sale and marketing activity and the pricing of our product are subject to extensive regulation under the ffdca the medicaid drug rebate program the fcpa and other federal and state statute including those discussed elsewhere in this form well the anti kickback statute anti bribery law the false claim act and similar law in international jurisdiction in addition to the potential for change to relevant law the compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government litigation settlement precedent advisory opinion and special fraud alert our approach to certain practice may evolve over time in light of these type of development requirement or industry standard in the and certain jurisdiction abroad require pharmaceutical manufacturer to track and disclose financial interaction with healthcare professional and healthcare provider and can increase government and public scrutiny of such financial interaction if an interaction is found to be improper government enforcement action and penalty could result like many company in our industry we have from time to time received and may receive in the future inquiry and subpoena and other type of information demand from government authority in addition we have been subject to claim and other action related to our business activity brought by governmental authority well consumer and private payer in some instance we have incurred significant expense civil payment fine and other adverse consequence result of these claim action and inquiry such claim action and inquiry may relate to alleged non compliance with law and regulation associated with the dissemination of product approved and unapproved information potentially resulting in government enforcement action and reputational damage this risk may be heightened by digital marketing including social medium mobile application and blogger outreach in connection with the resolution of government investigation concerning independent copay assistance organization that provide financial assistance to medicare patient in we entered into corporate integrity agreement cia with the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human service which is effective for period of five year in the cia we agreed to implement and or maintain certain compliance program element to promote compliance with federal healthcare program requirement breach of the cia could result in severe sanction against we and certain of our subsidiary are also subject to numerous contingency arising in the ordinary course of business relating to legal claim and proceeding including environmental contingency amount recorded for legal and environmental contingency can result from complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption while we have accrued for worldwide legal liability there is no guarantee that additional cost will not be incurred beyond the amount accrued for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceeding in which we are involved in see note risk related to intellectual property technology and security intellectual property protectionour success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive product we rely and expect to continue to rely on combination of intellectual property including patent trademark trade dress copyright trade secret and domain name protection law well confidentiality and license agreement to protect our intellectual property and proprietary right if we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection we may not be able to prevent third party from launching generic or biosimilar version of our branded product from using our proprietary technology or from marketing product that are very similar or identical to our currently pending or future patent application may not result in issued patent or be granted on timely basis similarly any term extension that we seek may not be granted on timely basis if at all in addition our issued patent may not contain claim sufficiently broad to protect against claim regarding validity enforceability scope and effective term made by party with similar technology or product or provide with any competitive advantage including exclusivity in particular product area the scope of our patent claim also may vary between country individual country have distinct patent law and our ability to enforce our patent depends on the law of each country it enforcement practice and the extent to which certain country engage in policy or practice pfizer inc form weaken country intellectual property framework law or regulation that promote or provide broad discretion to issue compulsory license in country that provide some form of regulatory exclusivity mechanism exist permitting some form of challenge to our patent by competitor or generic drug marketer prior to or immediately following the expiration of such regulatory exclusivity and generic company are employing aggressive strategy such at risk launch that challenge our patent right most of the suit involve claim by generic drug manufacturer that patent covering our product us process or dosage form are invalid and or do not cover the product of the generic or biosimilar drug manufacturer independent action have been filed alleging that our assertion of or attempt to enforce patent right with respect to certain product constitute unfair competition and or violation of antitrust law such claim may also be brought counterclaim to action we bring to enforce our patent we are also party to other patent damage suit in various jurisdiction pursuant to which generic drug manufacturer payer government or other party are seeking damage from for alleged delay of generic entry we also are often involved in other proceeding such inter partes review post grant review examination or opposition proceeding before the patent and trademark office the european patent office or other foreign counterpart relating to our intellectual property or the intellectual property right of others also if one of our patent or competitor patent is found to be invalid in such proceeding generic or biosimilar product could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sale of our existing product for additional information including information regarding certain legal proceeding in which we are involved see note further if we are unable to maintain our existing license agreement or other agreement pursuant to which third party grant right to intellectual property our operating result and financial condition could be adversely affected we currently hold trademark registration and have trademark application pending in many jurisdiction any of which may be the subject of governmental or third party objection which could prevent the maintenance or issuance of the trademark our product mature our reliance on our trademark and trade dress to differentiate from our competitor increase and result our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to prevent third party from adopting registering or using trademark and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our right we seek to protect our proprietary information including our trade secret and proprietary know how by requiring our employee consultant other advisor and other third party to execute proprietary information and confidentiality agreement upon the commencement of their relationship with despite these effort and precaution we may be unable to prevent third party from copying or otherwise obtaining and using our trade secret or our other intellectual property without authorization and legal remedy may not adequately compensate for the damage caused by such unauthorized use further others may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar or identical product that circumvent our intellectual property by mean of alternative design or process or otherwise third party intellectual property claimsa properly functioning intellectual property regime is essential to our business model we are committed to respecting the valid intellectual property right of other company but the patent granting process is imperfect accordingly the pursuit of valid business opportunity may require to challenge intellectual property right held by others that we believe were improperly granted including challenge through negotiation and litigation and such challenge may not always be successful part of our business depends upon identifying biosimilar opportunity and launching product to take advantage of those opportunity which may involve litigation associated cost and time delay and may ultimately not be successful these opportunity may arise in situation where patent protection of equivalent branded product ha expired or been declared invalid or where product do not infringe the patent of others in some circumstance we may take action such litigation asserting that our product do not infringe patent of existing product or that those patent are invalid or unenforceable in order to achieve first to market or early market position for our product third party may claim that our product infringe one or more patent owned or controlled by them claim of intellectual property infringement can be costly and time consuming to resolve may delay or prevent product launch and may result in significant damage we are involved in patent related dispute with third party over our attempt to market generic pharmaceutical product and biosimilars once we have final regulatory approval of the related generic product or biosimilars we may decide to commercially market these product even though associated legal proceeding including any appeal have not been resolved at risk launch if one of our marketed product is found to infringe valid patent right of third party such third party may be awarded significant damage or we may be prevented from further sale of that product such damage may be enhanced much three fold if we or one of our subsidiary is found to have willfully infringed valid patent right of third party information technology

technical and procedural control to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such confidential information we have outsourced significant element of our operation including significant element of our information technology infrastructure and result we manage relationship with many third party vendor who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our

integrating these business with we for example may fail to achieve cost saving anticipated with certain of these acquisition or such cost saving within the expected time frame similarly the accretive impact anticipated from certain of these acquisition may not be realized or may be delayed integration of these business may result in the loss of key employee the disruption of ongoing business including third party relationship or inconsistency in standard control procedure and policy we also may fail to generate the expected revenue growth for the acquired business expected revenue from acquired product and product candidate also may be constrained by development outside of our control unsuccessful clinical trial regulatory hurdle and commercialization challenge may adversely impact revenue and income contribution from product and product candidate including those acquired in these acquisition spin off and combination of upjohn with mylanwe may not realize some or all of the expected benefit of the spin off and combination the transaction of the upjohn business with mylan which resulted in the creation of viatris due to many factor including among others strategic

exclusivity respond to healthcare and innovation trend and provide for earnings growth result we devote considerable resource to our activity which while essential to our growth incorporate high degree of risk and cost including whether particular product candidate or new indication for an in line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile will be approved by regulator or will be successful commercially we conduct clinical trial to pfizer inc form data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of drug overall benefit risk profile for particular patient population in addition after product ha been approved and launched we continue to monitor it safety long it is available to patient this includes postmarketing trial that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge for the entire life of the product we collect safety data and report safety information to the fda and other regulatory authority regulatory authority may evaluate potential safety concern and take regulatory action in response such updating product labeling restricting it use communicating new safety information to the public or in rare case requiring to suspend or remove product from the market the commercial potential of in line product may be negatively impacted by post marketing development intellectual property right and collaboration licensing rightsthe loss expiration or invalidation of intellectual property right patent litigation settlement with manufacturer and the expiration of co promotion and licensing right can have material adverse effect on our revenue certain of our product have experienced patent based expiration or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain market in the last few year and we expect certain product to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few year for example the basic product patent for chantix in the expired in november also the basic product patent for sutent in the will expire in august while additional patent expiry will continue we expect moderate impact of reduced revenue due to patent expiry from through we continue to vigorously defend our patent right against infringement and we will continue to support effort that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent right while taking necessary step to ensure appropriate patient access for additional information on patent right we consider most significant to our business whole see the item business patent and other intellectual property right section in

administrative expense related to the fee payable to the federal regulatory environment pricing and access government and other payer group pressuresthe pricing of medicine by pharmaceutical manufacturer and the cost of healthcare which includes medicine medical service and hospital service continues to be important to payer government patient and other stakeholder federal and state government and private third party payer in the continue to take action to manage the utilization of drug and cost of drug including increasingly employing formulary to control cost by taking into account discount in connection with decision about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement we consider number of factor impacting the pricing of our medicine within the we often engage with patient doctor and healthcare plan we also often provide significant discount from the list price to insurer including pbms and mcos the price that patient pay in the for prescribed medicine is ultimately set by healthcare provider and insurer on average insurer impose higher out of pocket burden on patient for prescription medicine than for comparably priced medical service certain government outside the provide healthcare at low to zero direct cost to consumer at the point of care and have significant power large single payer to effectively regulate price or patient reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system government may use variety of measure including proposing pricing reform or legislation cross country collaboration

impacted our business operation and financial condition and result for additional information on the impact of covid on our revenue please see the overview of our performance operating environment strategy and outlook our performance section of this md our response to covid are committed to confronting the public health challenge posed by the pandemic by collaborating with industry partner and academic institution to develop potential approach to prevent and treat covid in march we issued five point plan calling on the biopharmaceutical industry to join in committing to unprecedented collaboration to combat covid subsequently we have made some important advance including among others entry into global agreement except for china hong kong macau and taiwan with biontech for the development manufacture and commercialization of an mrna based coronavirus vaccine to help prevent covid in november the company announced that after conducting the final efficacy analysis in the phase study met both of the study primary efficacy endpoint pfizer inc form of the data indicated vaccine efficacy rate against covid of in participant without prior sars cov infection first primary objective and also in participant with and without prior sars cov infection second primary objective in each case measured from seven day after the second dose the fda authorized the distribution and use of in the to help prevent covid for individual year of age and older under an eua issued in december ha not been approved or licensed by the fda the eua authorizes distribution and use of this product subject to the condition set forth in the eua and only for the duration of the declaration by the department of health human service that circumstance exist justifying authorization of emergency use of drug and biological product such during the covid pandemic under section of the ffdca the declaration or until revocation of the eua by the fda the fda ha issued euas to certain other company for product intended for the prevention or treatment of covid and may continue to do so during the duration of the declaration the fda expects eua holder to work towards submission of bla soon possible ha now been granted cma eua or temporary authorization in more than country worldwide the company continue to study including study evaluating it in additional population booster dos and emerging variant based on the updated dose labeling and subject to continuous process improvement expansion at current facility and adding new supplier and contract manufacturer the company believe that they can potentially manufacture at least billion dos in total by the end of the company have entered into agreement to supply pre specified dos of with multiple developed and emerging nation around the world and are continuing to deliver dos of to government under such agreement of february based on the dos to be delivered in primarily under agreement entered into of february including among others agreement with the government to supply million dos the european commission to supply million dos the japanese government to supply million dos and covid vaccine global access covax for up to million dos in subject to the negotiation and execution of additional agreement under the covax facility structure we forecasted approximately billion in revenue in from with gross margin to be split evenly with biontech this forecast wa based on dos mostly covered under agreement entered into of february and did not include all of the dos we can potentially deliver by the end of the company continue to enter into agreement with government for additional dos including among others the exercise by the government of an option for an additional million dos and an agreement with the european commission for an additional million dos to be delivered in accordingly this forecast may change based in part on these and future additional agreement that may be signed and circumstance warrant for additional information on our covid vaccine development program see note and the item risk factor covid pandemic section in this form initiation in september of phase clinical trial in hospitalized participant with covid to evaluate the safety tolerability and pharmacokinetics of novel investigational protease inhibitor for covid pf which is phosphate prodrug of like protease inhibitor pf despite our significant investment and effort any of our ongoing development program related to covid may not be successful the risk of failure is significant and there can be no certainty these effort will yield successful product or that cost will ultimately be recouped impact of covid on our business and operation the following discussion summarizes our current view of key business and operational area impacted by the pandemic and it effect on our business operation and financial condition and result part of our on going monitoring and assessment we have made certain assumption regarding the covid pandemic for purpose of our operational planning and financial projection including assumption regarding the duration severity and the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic well covid vaccine supply and contract which remain dynamic despite careful tracking and planning we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operation and financial condition and result due to the uncertainty of future development in particular we believe the ultimate impact on our business operation and financial condition and result will be affected by the speed and extent of the continued spread of the coronavirus globally the emergence of additional virus variant the duration of the pandemic new information regarding the severity and incidence of covid the safety efficacy and availability of vaccine and treatment for covid the rate at which the population becomes vaccinated against covid the global macroeconomic impact of the pandemic and governmental or regulatory action to contain the virus or control supply of medicine we are focused on all aspect of our business and are implementing measure aimed at mitigating issue where possible including by using digital technology to assist in operation for our commercial manufacturing and enabling function globally our business and operation have been impacted by the pandemic in various way for example at this time most of our colleague who are able to perform their job function outside of our facility continue to work remotely while certain colleague in the pgs and wrdm organization continue to work onsite and are subject to strict protocol intended to reduce the risk of transmission while engagement with healthcare professional ha started to return to pre pandemic level due to our virtual engagement capability our sale force colleague continue to encounter mixed access result of ongoing restriction on in person meeting we are actively reviewing and assessing epidemiological data and our colleague remain ready to resume in person engagement with healthcare professional on location by location basis soon it is safe to do so during the pandemic we have adapted our promotional platform by amplifying our existing digital capability to reach healthcare professional and customer to provide critical education and information including increasing the scale of our remote engagement we have not seen significant disruption to our supply chain to date and all of our manufacturing site globally have continued to operate at or near normal level after brief pause to the recruitment portion of certain ongoing clinical study and delay to most new study start we restarted recruitment across the development portfolio including new study start in late april our portfolio of product experienced varying impact from the pandemic some of our product are medically necessary but also more reliant on maintenance therapy with continuing patient in addition to new patient some of our product are more reliant on new patient start and typically require doctor visit including wellness visit and some of our product are identified medically necessary for treatment in the pandemic large proportion of our portfolio comprises oral or self injected medicine that do not require visit to an infusion center or physician office for administration but vaccine and physician administered medicine which do require office visit were impacted in by covid related mobility restriction or limitation and decline in patient visit to doctor in addition certain of our vaccine such prevnar prevenar may be impacted by recommendation by certain health official to not co administer such vaccine alongside the covid vaccine for additional detail on the impact of the covid pandemic on our product see the analysis of the consolidated statement of income revenue selected product discussion section within md pfizer inc form the foregoing impact of the pandemic given our significant operating cash flow well our financial asset access to capital market and revolving credit agreement we believe we have and expect to maintain the ability to meet liquidity need for the foreseeable future we will continue to pursue effort to maintain the continuity of our operation while monitoring for new development related to the pandemic future development could result in additional favorable or unfavorable impact on our business operation or financial condition and result if we experience significant disruption in our manufacturing or supply chain or significant disruption in clinical trial or other operation or if demand for our product is significantly reduced result of the covid pandemic we could experience material adverse impact on our business operation and financial condition and result see the item risk factor covid pandemic section of this form significant accounting policy and application of critical accounting estimate and assumptionsfollowing is discussion about the critical accounting estimate and assumption impacting our consolidated financial statement also see note for description of our significant accounting policy see note of these policy the following are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statement they require the application of the most subjective and the most complex judgment acquisition note fair value note revenue note asset impairment note tax asset and liability and income tax contingency note pension and postretirement benefit plan note and legal and environmental contingency note acquisition and fair valuefor discussion about the application of fair value see the following recent acquisition note investment note benefit plan asset note and asset impairment below revenuesour gross product revenue are subject to variety of deduction which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue are recognized such variable consideration represents chargebacks rebate sale allowance and sale return these deduction represent estimate of the related obligation and such knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deduction on gross sale for reporting period historically adjustment to these estimate to reflect actual result or updated expectation have not been material to our overall business and generally have been le than of revenue product specific rebate however can have significant impact on year over year individual product revenue growth trend if any of our ratio factor assessment experience or judgment are not indicative or accurate estimate of our future experience our result could be materially affected the potential of our estimate to vary sensitivity differs by program product type of customer and geographic location however estimate associated with medicare medicaid and performance based contract rebate are most at risk for material adjustment because of the extensive time delay between the recording of the accrual and it ultimate settlement an interval that can generally range up to one year because of this lag our recording of adjustment to reflect actual amount can incorporate revision of several prior quarter asset impairmentswe review all of our long lived asset for impairment indicator throughout the year we perform impairment testing for indefinite lived intangible asset and goodwill at least annually and for all other long lived asset whenever impairment indicator are present when necessary we record charge for impairment of long lived asset for the amount by which the fair value is le than the carrying value of these asset our impairment review process are described in note example of event or circumstance that may be indicative of impairment include significant adverse change in legal factor or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset for example successful challenge of our patent right would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used such restriction imposed by the fda or other regulatory authority that could affect our ability to manufacture or sell product an expectation of loss or reduced profit associated with an asset this could result for example from change in government reimbursement program that result in an inability to sustain projected product revenue and profitability this also could result from the introduction of competitor product that impact projected revenue growth well the lack of acceptance of product by patient physician and payer for ipr project this could result from among other thing change in outlook based on clinical trial data delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditure to commercialize the product identifiable intangible assetswe use an income approach specifically the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of intangible asset other than goodwill we start with forecast of all the expected net cash flow associated with the asset which incorporates the consideration of terminal value for indefinite lived asset and we apply an asset specific discount rate to arrive at net present value amount some of the more significant estimate and assumption that impact our fair value estimate include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flow which includes the expected impact of competitive legal and or regulatory force on the projection and the impact of technological advancement and risk associated with ipr asset well the selection of long term growth rate the discount rate which seek to reflect the various risk inherent in the projected cash flow and the tax rate which seek to incorporate the geographic origin of the projected cash flow while all intangible asset other than goodwill can face event and circumstance that can lead to impairment those that are most at risk of impairment include ipr asset approximately billion of december and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite lived brand asset ipr asset are high risk asset given the uncertain nature of newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite lived asset are more vulnerable to impairment the asset are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or pfizer inc form value at the end of each reporting period such immediately after acquisition or impairment even small decline in the outlook for these asset can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge goodwillour goodwill impairment review work of december concluded that none of our goodwill wa impaired and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time in our review we first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount qualitative factor that we consider include for example macroeconomic and industry condition overall financial performance and other relevant entity specific event if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value we then perform quantitative fair value test when we are required to determine the fair value of reporting unit we mainly use the income approach but may also use the market approach or weighted average combination of both approach the income approach is forward looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecast within the income approach we use the discounted cash flow method we start with forecast of all the expected net cash flow for the reporting unit which includes the application of terminal value and then we apply reporting unit specific discount rate to arrive at net present value amount some of the more significant estimate and assumption inherent in this approach include the amount and timing of the projected net cash flow which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive legal and or regulatory force on the projection well the selection of long term growth rate the discount rate which seek to reflect the various risk inherent in the projected cash flow and the tax rate which seek to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flow the market approach is historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information we may use two alternative method within the market approach guideline public company method this method employ market multiple derived from market price of stock of company that are engaged in the same or similar line of business and that are actively traded on free and open market and the application of the identified multiple to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit financial performance guideline transaction method this method relies on pricing multiple derived from transaction of significant interest in company engaged in the same or similar line of business and the application of the identified multiple to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit financial performance the market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued however these assessment may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate some of the more significant estimate and assumption inherent in this approach include the selection of appropriate guideline company and transaction and the determination of applicable premium and discount based on any difference in ownership percentage ownership right business ownership form or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline company and transaction for all of our reporting unit there are number of future event and factor that may impact future result and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing for list of these factor see the forward looking information and factor that may affect future result and the item risk factor section in this form benefit plansfor description of our different benefit plan see note effective january accrual for future benefit under the pcpp our largest defined benefit plan and the defined benefit section of the pfizer group pension scheme our largest pension plan in the were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service cost for the plan the pfizer defined contribution saving plan provides additional annual contribution to those previously accruing benefit under the pcpp and active member of the pfizer group pension scheme started accruing benefit under the defined contribution section of that plan our assumption reflect our historical experience and our judgment regarding future expectation that have been deemed reasonable by management the judgment made in determining the cost of our benefit plan can materially impact our result of operation the following provides at the end of each year the expected annual rate of return on plan asset for the

respective plan the expected annual rate of return on plan asset for our plan and the majority of our international plan is applied to the fair value of plan asset at each year end and the resulting

by reference to investment grade corporate bond rated aa aa or better including when there is sufficient data yield curve approach these discount rate determination are made in consideration of local requirement the measurement of the plan obligation at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit cost in

the payout for performance share award is determined in part by adjusted net income which is derived from adjusted income effective for the performance year and consistent with shareholder feedback received in the compensation committee of the bod approved adding an pipeline achievement factor to the existing short term incentive financial metric adjusted income and it component and adjusted diluted eps are non gaap financial measure that have no standardized meaning prescribed by gaap and therefore are limited in their usefulness to investor because of their non standardized definition they may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measure of other company and are presented solely to permit investor to more fully understand how management ass performance limitation of these measure is that they provide view of our operation without including all event during period and do not provide comparable view of our performance to peer these measure are not and should not be viewed substitute for their directly comparable gaap measure of net income attributable to pfizer inc common shareholder component of net income attributable to pfizer inc common shareholder and eps attributable to pfizer inc common shareholder diluted respectively see the accompanying reconciliation of certain gaap reported to non gaap adjusted information for and below we also recognize that internal measure of performance these measure have limitation and we do not restrict our performance management process solely to these measure we also use other tool designed to achieve the highest level of performance for example our organization ha productivity target upon which it effectiveness is measured in addition total shareholder return both on an absolute basis and relative to publicly traded pharmaceutical index play significant role in determining payouts under certain of our incentive compensation plan purchase accounting adjustmentsadjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impact resulting from business combination and net asset acquisition these impact can include the incremental charge to cost of sale from the sale of acquired inventory that wa written up to fair value amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite lived intangible asset and to much lesser extent depreciation related to the increase decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed asset amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt and the fair value change for contingent consideration therefore the adjusted income measure includes the revenue earned upon the sale of the acquired product without considering the acquisition cost of those product the exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible asset provides management and investor an alternative view of our result by providing degree of parity to internally developed intangible asset for which cost have been expensed however we have not factored in the impact of any other difference that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible asset on our own such different cost timeline or resulting sale accordingly this approach doe not intend to be representative of the result that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible asset internally acquisition related costsadjusted income excludes acquisition related cost which are comprised of transaction integration restructuring charge and additional depreciation cost for business combination because these cost are unique to each transaction and represent cost that were incurred to restructure and integrate business result of an acquisition we have made no adjustment for resulting synergy the significant cost incurred in connection with business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate asset activity or employee natural result of acquiring fully integrated set of activity for this reason we believe that such cost incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those cost incurred in other more normal business context the integration and restructuring cost for business combination may occur over several year with the more significant impact typically ending within three year of the relevant transaction because of the need for certain external approval for some action the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activity can be lengthy discontinued operationsadjusted income excludes the result of discontinued operation well any related gain or loss on the disposal of such operation we believe that this presentation is meaningful to investor because while we review our therapeutic area and product line for strategic fit with our operation we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue part of our business restatement due to discontinued operation do not impact compensation or change the adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated period but are presented for consistency across all period certain significant itemsadjusted income excludes certain significant item representing substantive and or unusual item that are evaluated individually on quantitative and qualitative basis certain significant item may be highly variable and difficult to predict furthermore in some case it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future period for example although major non acquisition related cost reduction program are specific to an event or goal with defined term we may have subsequent program based on reorganization of the business cost productivity or in response to loe or economic condition legal charge to resolve litigation are also related to

and the completion of the spin off of our upjohn business in the fourth quarter of pfizer ha transformed into more focused global leader in science based innovative medicine and vaccine we now operate single operating segment engaged in the discovery development manufacturing marketing sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical product worldwide regional commercial organization market distribute and sell our product our commercial organization is supported by global platform function that are responsible for the research development manufacturing and supply of our product the business is also supported by global corporate enabling function our determination that we operate single segment is consistent with the financial information regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker for purpose of evaluating performance allocating resource setting incentive compensation target and planning and forecasting for future period our chief operating decision maker allocates resource and ass financial performance on consolidated basis prior period information ha been restated to reflect our current organizational structure following the separation of the upjohn business for information about product and geographic revenue see note certain amount in the consolidated financial statement and associated note may not add due to rounding all percentage have been calculated using unrounded amount new accounting standard adopted in january we adopted the following accounting standard credit loss on financial instrument we adopted new accounting standard for credit loss on financial instrument which replaces the probable initial recognition threshold for incurred loss estimate under prior guidance with methodology that reflects expected credit loss estimate the standard generally impact financial asset that have contractual right to receive cash and are not accounted for at fair value through net income such account receivable and held to maturity debt security the new guidance requires to identify analyze document and support new methodology for quantifying expected credit loss estimate for certain financial instrument using information such historical experience current economic condition and information and the use of reasonable and supportable forecasted information the standard also amends existing impairment guidance for available for sale debt security to incorporate credit loss allowance and allows for reversal of credit impairment in the event the issuer credit improves we adopted the new accounting standard utilizing the modified retrospective method and therefore no adjustment were made to prior period financial statement the cumulative effect of adopting the standard an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings wa not material the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our consolidated statement of income or consolidated statement of cash flow for the year ended december on our consolidated balance sheet of december for additional information see note goodwill impairment testing we prospectively adopted the new standard which eliminates the requirement to perform hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment under the new guidance the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount pfizer inc form to consolidated financial statementspfizer inc and subsidiary companiesof the reporting unit exceeds it fair value there wa no impact to our consolidated financial statement from the adoption of this new standard implementation cost in cloud computing arrangement we prospectively adopted the new standard related to customer accounting for implementation cost incurred in cloud computing arrangement that is considered service contract the new guidance aligns the requirement for capitalizing implementation cost in such arrangement with the requirement for capitalizing implementation cost incurred to develop or obtain internal use software the adoption of this guidance did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement collaboration agreement we prospectively adopted the new standard which provides guidance clarifying the interaction between the accounting for collaborative arrangement and revenue from contract with customer there wa no impact to our consolidated financial statement from the adoption of this new standard estimate and assumptionsin preparing these financial statement we use certain estimate and assumption that affect reported amount and disclosure these estimate and assumption can impact all element of our financial statement for example in the consolidated statement of income estimate are used when accounting for deduction from revenue determining the cost of inventory that is sold allocating cost in the form of depreciation and amortization and estimating restructuring charge and the impact of contingency well determining provision for tax on income on the consolidated balance sheet estimate are used in determining the valuation and recoverability of asset and in determining the reported amount of liability all of which also impact the consolidated statement of income certain estimate of fair value and amount recorded in connection with acquisition revenue deduction impairment review restructuring associated charge investment and financial instrument valuation allowance pension and postretirement benefit plan contingency share based compensation and other calculation can result from complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption our estimate are often based on complex judgment and assumption that we believe to be reasonable but that can be inherently uncertain and unpredictable if our estimate and assumption are not representative of actual outcome our result could be materially impacted future event and their effect can not be determined with precision our estimate and assumption may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that might cause to change those estimate and assumption we are subject to risk and uncertainty that may cause actual result to differ from estimated amount such change in the healthcare environment competition litigation legislation and regulation we regularly evaluate our estimate and assumption using historical experience and expectation about the future we adjust our estimate and assumption when fact and circumstance indicate the need for change acquisitionsour consolidated financial statement include the operation of acquired business after the completion of the acquisition we account for acquired business using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other thing that most asset acquired and liability assumed be recognized at their estimated fair value of the acquisition date and that the fair value of acquired ipr be recorded on the balance sheet transaction cost are expensed incurred any excess of the consideration transferred over the assigned value of the net asset acquired is recorded goodwill when we acquire net asset that do not constitute business defined in gaap no goodwill is recognized and acquired ipr is expensed contingent consideration in business combination is included part of the acquisition cost and is recognized at fair value of the acquisition date fair value is generally estimated by using probability weighted discounted cash flow approach see note any liability resulting from contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the contingency is resolved these change in fair value are recognized in earnings in other income deduction net fair valuewe measure certain asset and liability at fair value either upon initial recognition or for subsequent accounting or reporting we estimate fair value using an exit price approach which requires among other thing that we determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly market the determination of an exit price is considered from the perspective of market participant considering the highest and best use of non financial asset and for liability assuming that the risk of non performance will be the same before and after the transfer when estimating fair value depending on the nature and complexity of the asset or liability we may use one or all of the following technique income approach which is based on the present value of future stream of net cash flow market approach which is based on market price and other information from market transaction involving identical or comparable asset or liability cost approach which is based on the cost to acquire or construct comparable asset le an allowance for functional and or economic obsolescence our fair value methodology depend on the following type of input quoted price for identical asset or liability in active market level input quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market or quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active or input other than quoted price that are directly or indirectly observable or input that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other mean level input unobservable input that reflect estimate and assumption level input pfizer inc form to consolidated financial statementspfizer inc and subsidiary companiesthe following input and valuation technique are used to estimate the fair value of our financial asset and liability available for sale debt security third party matrix pricing model that us significant input derived from or corroborated by observable market data and credit adjusted yield curve equity security with readily determinable fair value quoted market price and observable nav price derivative asset and liability third party matrix pricing model that us input derived from or corroborated by observable market data where applicable these model use market based observable input including interest rate yield curve to discount future cash flow amount and forward and spot price for currency the credit risk impact to our derivative financial instrument wa not significant money market fund observable nav price we periodically review the methodology input and output of third party pricing service for reasonableness our procedure can include for example referencing other third party pricing model monitoring key observable input like benchmark interest rate and selectively performing test comparison of value with actual sale of financial instrument foreign currency translationfor most of our international operation local currency have been determined to be the functional currency we translate functional currency asset and liability to their dollar equivalent at exchange rate in effect of the balance sheet date and income and expense amount at average exchange rate for the period the dollar effect that arise from changing translation rate are recorded in other comprehensive income loss the effect of converting non functional currency monetary asset and liability into the functional currency are recorded in other income deduction net for operation in highly inflationary economy we translate monetary item at rate in effect of the balance sheet date with translation adjustment recorded in other income deduction net and we translate non monetary item at historical rate revenue and trade account receivablerevenue recognition we record revenue from product sale when there is transfer of control of the product from to the customer we determine transfer of control based on when the product is shipped or delivered and title pass to the customer our sale contract sale on credit are typically under short term contract collection are based on market payment cycle common in various market with shorter cycle in the sale are adjusted for sale allowance chargebacks rebate and sale return and cash discount sale return occur due to loe product recall or changing competitive environment deduction from revenue our gross product revenue are subject to variety of deduction which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenue are recognized such variable consideration represents chargebacks rebate sale allowance and sale return these deduction represent estimate of the related obligation and such knowledge and judgment is required when estimating the impact of these revenue deduction on gross sale for reporting period provision for pharmaceutical sale return provision are based on calculation for each market that incorporates the following appropriate local return policy and practice historical return percentage of sale an understanding of the reason for past return estimated shelf life by product an estimate of the amount of time between shipment and return or lag time and any other factor that could impact the estimate of future return such loe product recall or changing competitive environment generally returned product are destroyed and customer are refunded the sale price in the form of credit we record sale incentive reduction of revenue at the time the related revenue are recorded or when the incentive is offered whichever is later we estimate the cost of our sale incentive based on our historical experience with similar incentive program to predict customer behavior the following outline our common sale arrangement customer our biopharmaceutical product are sold principally to wholesaler but we also sell directly to retailer hospital clinic government agency and pharmacy in the we primarily sell our vaccine product directly to the federal government cdc wholesaler individual provider office retail pharmacy and integrated delivery network outside the we primarily sell our vaccine to government and non government institution customer for our consumer healthcare business which were part of the business that wa combined with gsk consumer healthcare business included retailer and to lesser extent wholesaler and distributor biopharmaceutical product that ultimately are used by patient are generally covered under governmental program managed care program and insurance program including those managed through pbms and are subject to sale allowance and or rebate payable directly to those program those sale allowance and rebate are generally negotiated but government program may have legislated amount by type of product patented or unpatented specifically in the we sell our product principally to distributor and hospital we also have contract with managed care program or pbms and legislatively mandated contract with the federal and state government under which we provide rebate based on medicine utilized by the life they cover we record provision for medicare medicaid and performance based contract pharmaceutical rebate based upon our experience ratio of rebate paid and actual prescription written during prior period we apply the experience ratio to the respective period sale to determine the rebate accrual and related expense this experience ratio is evaluated regularly to ensure that the historical trend are current practicable we estimate discount on branded prescription drug sale to medicare part participant in the medicare coverage gap also known the doughnut hole based on the historical experience of beneficiary prescription and consideration of the utilization that is expected to result from the discount in the coverage gap we evaluate this estimate regularly to ensure that the historical trend and future expectation are current practicable for performance based contract rebate we also consider current contract term such change in formulary status and rebate rate outside the the majority of our pharmaceutical sale allowance are contractual or legislatively mandated and our estimate are based on actual invoiced sale within each period which reduces the risk of variation in the estimation process in certain european country pfizer inc form to consolidated financial statementspfizer inc and subsidiary companiesrebates are calculated on the government total unbudgeted pharmaceutical spending or on specific product sale threshold and we apply an estimated allocation factor against our actual invoiced sale to project the expected level of reimbursement we obtain third party information that help to monitor the adequacy of these accrual provision for pharmaceutical chargebacks primarily reimbursement to wholesaler for honoring contracted price to third party closely approximate actual amount incurred we settle these deduction generally within two to five week of incurring the liability we recorded direct product sale and or alliance revenue of more than billion for each of seven product in for each of six product in and for each of seven product in in the aggregate these direct product sale and or alliance product revenue represent of our revenue in of our revenue in and of our revenue in see note for additional information the loss or expiration of intellectual property right can have significant adverse effect on our revenue our contract with customer will generally be at lower selling price due to added competition and we generally provide for higher sale return during the period in which individual market begin to near the loss or expiration of intellectual property right our accrual for medicare medicaid and related state program and performance based contract rebate chargebacks sale

noncurrent total accrued rebate and other sale related accrual tax collected from customer relating to product sale and remitted to governmental authority are excluded from revenue trade account receivable trade account receivable are stated at their net realizable value the allowance for credit loss reflects our best estimate of expected credit loss of the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience current information and forecast of future economic condition in developing the estimate for expected credit loss trade account receivables are segmented into pool of asset depending on market versus international delinquency status and customer type high risk versus low risk and government versus non government and fixed reserve percentage are established for each pool of trade account receivables in determining the reserve percentage for each pool of trade account receivables we considered our historical experience with certain customer and customer type regulatory and legal environment country and political risk and other relevant current and future forecasted macroeconomic factor these credit risk indicator are monitored on quarterly basis to determine whether there have been any change in the economic environment that would indicate the established reserve percentage should be adjusted and are considered on regional basis to reflect more geographic specific metric additionally write offs and recovery of customer receivables are tracked against collection on quarterly basis to determine whether the reserve percentage remain appropriate when management becomes aware of certain customer specific factor that impact credit risk specific allowance for these known troubled account are recorded trade account receivable are written off

certain commitmentswe and certain of our subsidiary are subject to numerous contingency arising in the ordinary course of business including tax and legal contingency the following outline our legal contingency for discussion of our tax contingency see note legal proceedingsour legal contingency include but are not limited to the following patent litigation which typically involves challenge to the coverage and or validity of patent on various product process or dosage form we are the plaintiff in the majority of these action an adverse outcome in action in which we are the plaintiff could result in loss of patent protection for drug significant loss of revenue from that drug or impairment of the value of associated asset product liability and other product related litigation which can include personal injury consumer off label promotion security antitrust and breach of contract claim among others often involves highly complex issue relating to medical causation label warning and reliance on those warning scientific evidence and finding actual provable injury and other matter commercial and other matter which can include acquisition licensing collaboration or co promotion related and product pricing claim and environmental claim and proceeding can involve complexity that will vary from matter to matter government investigation which often are related to the extensive regulation of pharmaceutical company by national state and local government agency in the and in other jurisdiction certain of these contingency could result in loss including damage fine and or civil penalty which could be substantial and or criminal charge we believe that our claim and defense in matter in which we are defendant are substantial but litigation is inherently unpredictable and excessive verdict do occur we do not believe that any of these matter will have material adverse effect on our financial position however we could incur judgment enter into settlement or revise our expectation regarding the outcome of matter which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and or our cash flow in the period in which the amount are accrued or paid we have accrued for loss that are both probable and reasonably estimable substantially all of our contingency are subject to significant uncertainty and therefore determining the likelihood of loss and or the measurement of any loss can be complex consequently we are unable to estimate the range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amount accrued our assessment which result from complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty are based on estimate and assumption that have been deemed reasonable by management but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that might cause to change those estimate and assumption amount recorded for legal and environmental contingency can result from complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption in august the sec amended it disclosure rule regarding the threshold for disclosure of proceeding under environmental law

statement including whether disclosure might change reader judgment about our financial statement in light of all of the information that is available to the reader the potential impact of the
