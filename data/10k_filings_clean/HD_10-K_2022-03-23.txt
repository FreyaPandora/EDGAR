and ease of shopping experience furthermore customer are increasingly shopping online and seeking faster and or guaranteed delivery time low price or free shipping and or convenient pickup option including curbside pickup our ability to be competitive on delivery and pickup time option and cost depends on many factor including leveraging the momentum of our strategic investment in our supply chain and our interconnected retail capability to further enhance the customer shopping experience and our failure to successfully manage these factor and offer competitive delivery and pickup option could negatively impact the demand for our product and our profit margin we use our marketing advertising and promotional program to drive customer traffic and compete more effectively and we must regularly ass and adjust our effort to address change in the competitive landscape intense competitive pressure from one or more of our competitor such through aggressive promotional pricing or

platform is fundamental to the success of our interconnected strategy we have our bos bopis bodfs and direct fulfillment delivery option but we can not guarantee that these or future program will be maintained and implemented successfully or that we will be able to meet customer expectation on delivery or pickup time option and cost in addition greater concentration of online sale with direct fulfillment or curbside pickup could result in reduction in the amount of traffic in our store which would in turn reduce the opportunity for cross selling of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our overall sale and adversely affect our financial performance failure to provide relevant or effective online customer experience in timely manner that keep pace with technological development and dynamic customer expectation to maintain appropriate inventory to provide quick and low price or free delivery alternative and convenient pickup option to differentiate the customer

and payment card information well other confidential and sensitive information such personal information about our associate and our supplier and confidential company information we also work with third party service provider that provide technology system and service that we use in connection with the handling of this information our information system and those of our third party service

liquidity and capital resourcesat january we had billion in cash and cash equivalent of which billion wa held by our foreign subsidiary we believe that our current cash position cash flow generated

material cash requirement in addition to our cash requirement we follow disciplined approach to capital allocation this approach first prioritizes investing in the business with the intent of then returning excess cash to shareholder in the form of dividend and share repurchase for fiscal we plan to invest approximately billion back into our business in the form of capital expenditure in line with our expectation of approximately two percent of net sale on an annual basis compared to billion in fiscal however we may adjust our capital expenditure to support the operation of the business to

disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statement the following discussion address our most critical accounting policy which are those that are both important to the representation of our financial condition and result of operation and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumption or complex estimate merchandise inventorieswe value the majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the first in first out method with the remainder of our inventory valued under cost method under the retail inventory method inventory are stated at cost which is determined by applying cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory of contentsthe retail value of our inventory is adjusted needed to reflect current market condition because these adjustment are based on current prevailing market condition the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on number of factor such markup markdowns and inventory loss or shrink such there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we determine markup and markdowns based on the consideration of variety of factor such current and anticipated demand customer preference and buying trend age of the merchandise and weather condition we calculate shrink based on actual inventory loss identified result of physical inventory count during each fiscal period and estimated inventory loss between physical inventory count the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical inventory count is calculated on store specific basis and is primarily based on recent shrink result increase in the shrink rate used to estimate our inventory shrink reserve would have increased cost of sale by approximately million for fiscal historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss ha not been material to our annual financial result due to change in operating condition during fiscal result of the covid pandemic we used the result from sample of store that were able to conduct physical inventory basis for estimating shrink for those store at which physical inventory count were temporarily suspended during fiscal we believe the sample of store that were selected for inventory count in fiscal provided reasonable basis for estimating shrink where physical inventory count wa not performed in fiscal during fiscal we performed all regularly scheduled physical inventory count including store location where physical inventory count were suspended during fiscal and the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss wa not material we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood for material change in the estimate or assumption we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and result in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market impairment of long lived assetswe evaluate our long lived asset each quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss our decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level the asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flow with their carrying value our cash flow projection look several year into the future and include assumption of variable such future sale and operating margin growth rate economic condition market competition and inflation if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flow we then measure the asset fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is le than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for location identified for closure or relocation we generally base our estimate of fair market value on market appraisal of owned location and estimate of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased location for operating location we generally base our fair value estimate on future cash flow projection described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow impairment of long lived asset were not material to our consolidated financial statement in fiscal fiscal or fiscal uncertain tax position we are subject to income tax in the united state and in multiple jurisdiction across our global operation thus the determination of our provision for income tax requires significant judgment the use of estimate and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our provision for income tax could be affected by many factor including change in business operation change in tax law outcome of income tax audit change in our assessment of certain tax contingency the impact of discrete tax item and the mix of earnings among our and foreign operation the calculation of our tax liability involves complexity and thus there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the assessment of uncertain tax position requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item we record the benefit of uncertain tax position in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will be sustained of contentsbusiness combinationswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of identifiable asset and liability requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available and requires significant amount of management judgment for the valuation of intangible asset acquired in business combination we typically use an income approach significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flow growth rate customer attrition rate discount rate and useful life the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is recorded goodwill during the measurement period which is up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings additional informationfor

merchandise inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by cost method these merchandise inventory represent approximately of the total merchandise inventory balance we evaluate

result historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss ha not been material to our annual financial result due to change in operating condition during fiscal result of the covid pandemic we used the result from sample of store that were able to conduct physical inventory basis for estimating shrink for those store at which physical inventory count were temporarily suspended during fiscal we believe the sample of store that were selected for inventory count in fiscal provided reasonable basis for estimating shrink where physical inventory count wa not performed in fiscal during fiscal we performed all regularly scheduled physical inventory count including store location where physical inventory count were suspended during fiscal and the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss wa not material property and equipmentbuildings and related improvement furniture fixture and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful life leasehold improvement and asset held under finance lease are amortized using the straight line method over the original term of the lease or the

incurred we evaluate our long lived asset each quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss our decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level the asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flow with their carrying value if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flow we then measure the asset fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is le than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value impairment loss on property and equipment are recorded component of sg impairment charge for long lived asset were not material to our consolidated financial statement in fiscal fiscal or fiscal leaseswe enter into contractual arrangement for the utilization of certain non owned asset which are evaluated finance or operating lease upon commencement and are accounted for accordingly specifically contract is or contains lease when the contract contains an explicitly or implicitly identified asset and we obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of that underlying asset and direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the contract in exchange for consideration we ass whether an arrangement is or contains lease at inception of the contract we lease certain retail location warehouse and distribution space office space equipment and vehicle substantial majority of our lease have remaining lease term of one to year typically with the option to extend the lease for five year term some of our lease may include the option to terminate in le than five year the of contentslease term used to calculate the right of use asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impact of option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option when determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement we consider various existing economic factor including market condition real estate strategy the nature length and term of the agreement well the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term based on these determination we generally conclude that the exercise of renewal option would not be reasonably certain in determining the lease term at commencement the discount rate used to calculate the present value of lease payment is the rate implicit in the lease when readily determinable the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable we use secured incremental borrowing rate which is updated on quarterly basis the discount rate for the present value of lease payment real estate tax insurance maintenance and operating expense applicable to the leased property are generally our obligation under our lease agreement in instance where these payment are fixed they are included in the measurement of our lease liability and when variable are excluded and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payment is incurred certain of our lease agreement also

the lease commencement date variable lease payment not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of our lease liability they can not be reasonably estimated and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payment is incurred lease that have term of twelve month or le upon commencement are considered short term in nature short term lease are not included on

our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for our canada and mexico reporting unit based on qualitative factor we performed qualitative assessment to determine if there were any indicator of impairment and concluded that while there have been event and circumstance in the macro environment that have impacted we have not experienced any entity specific indicator that would
