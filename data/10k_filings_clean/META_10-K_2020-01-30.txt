our facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp product for reference to accessing facebook or our other product on the web or via website such term refer to accessing such product on personal computer for reference to accessing facebook or our other product on mobile such term refers to accessing such product via mobile application or via mobile optimized version of our website such facebook com whether on mobile phone or tablet of contentslimitations of key metric and other datathe number for our key metric are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user account we have historically reported the number of our daily active user daus monthly active user maus and average revenue per user arpu collectively our facebook metric based on user activity on facebook and messenger and not on our other product beginning with this annual report on form we also are reporting our estimate of the number of our daily active people dap monthly active people map and average revenue per person arpp collectively our family metric based on the activity of user visited least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp collectively our family of product during the applicable period of measurement we believe our family metric better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using than one of our product result time we intend to report our family metric our key metric in place of daus maus and arpu in our periodic report filed with the security and exchange commission these number are based on we believe to be reasonable estimate of our user base for the applicable period of measurement are inherent challenge in measuring usage of our product across large online and mobile population around the world the methodology used to measure these metric require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimate of our user base and such estimate may change due to improvement or change in our methodology we regularly review our process for calculating these metric and from time to time we discover inaccuracy in our metric or make adjustment to improve accuracy which can result in adjustment to our historical metric our ability to recalculate our historical metric may be impacted by data limitation or other factor that require to apply different methodology for such adjustment we generally not intend to update previously disclosed family metric for any such inaccuracy or adjustment that are within the error margin disclosed in addition our facebook metric and family metric estimate will differ from estimate published by third party due to difference in methodology facebook metricswe regularly evaluate our facebook metric to estimate the number of duplicate and false account among our maus duplicate account is one that user maintains in addition to or principal account we divide false account two category user misclassified account where user have created personal profile for business organization or non human entity such pet such entity are permitted on facebook using page rather than personal profile our term of service and violating account which represent user profile that we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service such bot and spam the estimate of duplicate and false account are based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate account we use data signal such identical ip address and similar user name and to identify false account we look for name that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewer any loss of access to data signal we use in this process whether result of our product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimate of duplicate and false account our estimate also may change our methodology evolve including the application of new data signal or technology or product change that may allow to identify previously undetected duplicate or false account and may improve our ability to evaluate broader population of our user duplicate and false account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false account may vary significantly from our estimate in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate account is meaningfully higher in developing market such the philippine and vietnam compared to more developed market in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false account can vary result of episodic spike in the creation of such account which we have seen originate more frequently in specific country such indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of duplicate or false account among our user which may also reduce our dau and mau estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the number of duplicate and false account among our maus on an annual basis of contentsthe number of daus and maus discussed in this annual report on form well arpu do not include user on instagram whatsapp or our other product unless they would otherwise qualify daus or maus respectively based on their other activity on facebook family metricsmany people in our community have user account on more than one of our product and people have multiple user account within an individual product accordingly for our family metric we do not seek to count the total number of user account across our product we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metric represent our estimate of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use common identifier or link their account to use multiple product in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people to calculate these metric we rely upon complex technique algorithm and machine learning model that seek to count the individual people behind user account including by matching multiple user account within an individual product and across multiple product we believe they are attributable to single person and counting such group of account one person these technique and model require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitation discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variance and uncertainty we estimate the potential error in our family metric primarily based on user survey data which is subject to error well while we expect the error margin for our family metric to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people and it is possible that the actual number of unique people using our product may vary significantly from our estimate potentially beyond our estimated error margin result it is also possible that our family metric may indicate change or trend in user number that do not match actual change or trend to calculate our estimate of family dap and map we currently use series of machine learning model that are developed based on internal review of limited sample of user account and calibrated user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these model and calculating these estimate for example to match user account within individual product and across multiple product we use data signal such similar device information ip address and user name we also calibrate our model against data from periodic user survey of varying size and frequency across our product which are inherently subject to error in addition our data limitation may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metric estimate our technique and model rely on variety of data signal from different product and we rely on more limited data signal for some product compared to others for example result of limited visibility into encrypted product we have fewer data signal from whatsapp user account and primarily rely on phone number and device information to match whatsapp user account with account on our other product similarly although messenger kid user are included in our family metric we do not seek to match their account with account on our other application for purpose of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signal we use in our process for calculating family metric whether result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metric our estimate of family metric also may change our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology product change or other improvement in our user survey algorithm or machine learning that may improve our ability to match account within and across our product or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our user in addition such evolution may allow to identify previously undetected violating account defined below we regularly evaluate our family metric to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account we define violating account account which we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service including bot and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating account such estimation is based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behavior associated with facebook and instagram account that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewer we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person ha one or more violating account we do not include such person in our violating account estimation long we believe they have one account that not constitute violating account from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of violating account among our user which may also reduce our dap and map estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account on an annual basis violating account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating account may vary significantly from our estimate of contentsthe number of family dap and map discussed in this annual report on form well arpp do not include user on our other product unless they would otherwise qualify dap or map respectively based on their other activity on our family product user geographyour data regarding the geographic location of our user is estimated based on number of factor such the user ip address and self disclosed location these factor may not always accurately reflect the user actual location for example user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user actual location the methodology used to measure our metric are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error and our estimate for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factor of contentspart iitem businessoverviewour mission is to give people the power to build

trademark copyright trade secret including know license agreement confidentiality procedure non disclosure agreement with third party employee disclosure and invention assignment agreement and other contractual right in addition to protect our proprietary right from time to time we have purchased patent and patent application from third party we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or group of related patent or copyright we believe the duration of our patent is adequate relative to the expected life of our product government regulation we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad that involve matter central to our business many of these law and regulation are still evolving and tested in court and could be interpreted in way that could harm our business these may involve privacy data protection and personal information right of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contract and other communication competition protection of minor consumer protection telecommunication product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibition or sanction anti corruption law compliance security law compliance and online payment service in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign law regarding privacy and protection of people data foreign data protection privacy content competition and other law and regulation can impose different obligation or be more restrictive than those in the united state federal and state and foreign law and regulation which in some case can be enforced by private party in addition to government entity are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change result the application interpretation and enforcement of these law and regulation are often uncertain particularly in the of contentsnew and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policy and practice proposed or new legislation and regulation could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may and applies to all of our product and service used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirement for company that receive or process personal data of resident of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union and includes significant penalty for non compliance the brazilian general data protection law will impose requirement similar to gdpr on product and service offered to user in brazil effective in august the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january also establishes certain transparency rule and creates new data privacy right for user similarly there are number of legislative proposal in the european union the united state at both the federal and state level well other jurisdiction that could impose new obligation or limitation in area affecting our business such liability for copyright infringement in addition some country are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirement or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirement that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our service we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigation inquiry data request request for information action and audit by government authority and regulator in the united state europe and around the world particularly in the area of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition we continue to grow and expand our operation we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory order or consent decree including the modified consent order we entered into in july with

decline and you could lose part or all of investment risk related to our business and industryif we fail to retain existing user or add new user or if our user decrease their level of engagement with our product our revenue financial result and business may be significantly harmed the size of our user base and our user level of engagement are critical to our success our financial performance ha been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active user of our product particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time the size of our active user base increase and we expect that the size of our active user base will fluctuate or decline in one or more market from time to time particularly in market where we have achieved higher penetration rate for example in the fourth quarter of we experienced slight decline on quarter over quarter basis in the number of daily active user on facebook in the united state canada region if people do not perceive our product to be useful reliable and trustworthy we may not be able to attract or retain user or otherwise maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement number of other social networking company that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user base or level of engagement decline in some case precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience similar erosion of our active user base or engagement level our user engagement pattern have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly we introduce new and different product and service any number of factor can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if user increasingly engage with other competitive product or service we fail to introduce new feature product or service that user find engaging or if we introduce new product or service or make change to existing product and service that are not favorably received user feel that their experience is diminished result of the decision we make with respect to the frequency prominence format size and quality of ad that we display user have difficulty installing updating or otherwise accessing our product on mobile device result of action by or third party that we rely on to distribute our product and deliver our service user behavior on any of our product change including decrease in the quality and frequency of content shared on our product and service we are unable to continue to develop product for mobile device that user find engaging that work with variety of mobile operating system and network and that achieve high level of market acceptance there are decrease in user sentiment due to question about the quality or usefulness of our product or our user data practice or concern related to privacy and sharing safety security well being or other factor we are unable to manage and prioritize information to ensure user are presented with content that is appropriate interesting useful and relevant to them we are unable to obtain or attract engaging third party content we are unable to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product of content user adopt new technology where our product may be displaced in favor of other product or service or may not be featured or otherwise available there are change mandated by legislation regulatory authority or litigation that adversely affect our product or user there is decreased engagement with our product or failure to accept our term of service part of change that we implemented in connection with the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe other similar change that we implemented in the united state and around the world or other change we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with other regulation regulatory action or otherwise technical or other problem prevent from delivering our product in rapid and reliable manner or otherwise affect the user experience such security breach or failure to prevent or limit spam or similar content we adopt term policy or procedure related to area such sharing content user data or advertising that are perceived negatively by our user or the general public we elect to focus our product decision on longer term initiative that do not prioritize near term user growth and engagement we make change in how we promote different product and service across our family of product initiative designed to attract and retain user and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether result of action by third party or otherwise third party initiative that may enable greater use of our product including low cost or discounted data plan are discontinued there is decreased engagement with our product result

and web application from time to time certain of these factor have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degree if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement our revenue and financial result may be adversely affected any decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our product le attractive to user marketer and developer which is likely to have material and adverse impact on our revenue business financial condition and result of operation if our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase level of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketer or reduction in spending by marketer could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third party advertising on facebook and instagram is common in the industry our marketer do not have long term advertising commitment with many of our marketer spend only relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with marketer will not continue to do business with of contentsor they will reduce the budget they are willing to commit to if we do not deliver ad in an effective manner or if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with will generate competitive return relative to other alternative we have recently implemented and we will continue to implement change to our user data practice some of these change reduce our ability to effectively target ad which ha to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketer with suitable return on investment the pricing of our ad may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial result may be harmed our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by number of other factor including decrease in user engagement including time spent on our product our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our product product change or inventory management decision we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ad displayed on our product or of other unpaid content shared by marketer on our product our inability to maintain or increase marketer demand the pricing of our ad or both our inability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ad shown to user including result of technical infrastructure constraint user behavior or product change that may reduce traffic to feature or product that we successfully monetize including result of our effort to promote the story format or increased usage of our messaging product reduction of advertising by marketer due to our effort to implement advertising policy that protect the security and integrity of our platform change to third party policy that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising the availability accuracy utility and security of analytics and measurement solution offered by or third party that demonstrate the value of our ad to marketer or our ability to further improve such tool loss of advertising market share to our competitor including if price to purchase our ad increase or if competitor offer lower priced more integrated or otherwise more effective product adverse government action or legislative regulatory or other legal development relating to advertising including development that may impact our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising decision by marketer to reduce their advertising result of adverse medium report or other negative publicity involving our user data practice our advertising metric or tool content on our product developer with mobile and web application that are integrated with our product or other company in our industry reduction of advertising by marketer due to objectionable content published on our product by third party question about our user data practice concern about brand safety or potential legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligation the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which user opt of certain type of ad targeting including result of product change and control that we implemented in connection with the gdpr california consumer privacy act ccpa or other similar change that we implemented in the united state and around the world for example we have seen an increasing number of user opt out of certain type of ad targeting in europe following adoption of the gdpr or other product change or control we have implemented or may implement in the future whether in connection with other regulation regulatory action or otherwise that impact our ability to target ad the degree to which user cease or reduce the number of time they engage with our ad change in the way advertising on mobile device or on personal computer is measured or priced of content change in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base and the impact of macroeconomic condition whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific type of marketer or within particular geography from time to time certain of these factor have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degree the occurrence of any of these or other factor in the future could result in reduction in demand for our ad which may reduce the price we receive for our ad or cause marketer to stop advertising with altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial result our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tool that incorporate data signal from user activity on website and service that we do not control and change to the regulatory environment third party mobile operating system and browser and our own product have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signal which will adversely affect our advertising revenue we rely on data signal from user activity on website and service that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ad to our user our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tool that incorporate these signal and any change in our ability to use such signal will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory change such the gdpr and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signal in our ad product in addition mobile operating system and browser provider such apple and google have announced product change well future plan to limit the ability of application developer to use these signal to target and measure advertising on their platform similarly we have implemented and may continue to implement product change that give user the ability to limit our use of such data signal to improve ad and other experience on our product and service including our facebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of product change we implemented in connection with the gdpr these development have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ad on our platform and any additional loss of such signal in the future will adversely affect our targeting and measurement capability and negatively impact our advertising revenue our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile device depend upon effective operation with mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile device there is no guarantee that popular mobile device will continue to feature facebook or our other product or that mobile device user will continue to use our product rather than competing product we are dependent on the interoperability of facebook and our other product with popular mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control such the android and io operating system and mobile browser any change bug or technical issue in such system or change in our relationship with mobile operating system partner handset manufacturer browser developer or mobile carrier or in their term of service or policy that degrade our product functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our product give preferential treatment to competitive product limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ad or charge fee related to the distribution of our product or our delivery of ad could adversely affect the usage of facebook or our other product and monetization on mobile device for example apple previously released an update to it safari browser that limit the use of third party cooky which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ad to our user and impact monetization and we expect that any similar change to it google or other browser or mobile platform will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ad and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile product it is important that our product work well with range of mobile technology product system network and standard that we do not control and that we have good relationship with handset manufacturer mobile carrier and browser developer we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationship with key participant in the mobile ecosystem or in developing product that operate effectively with these technology product system network or standard in the event that it is more difficult for our user to access and use facebook or our other product on their mobile device or if our user choose not to access or use facebook or our other product on their mobile device or use mobile product that do not offer access to facebook or our other product our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take action regarding the distribution of our product or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long term best interest such action may adversely affect our user and our relationship with the operator of mobile operating system handset manufacturer mobile carrier browser developer or other business partner and there is no assurance that these action will result in the anticipated long term benefit in the event that our user are adversely affected of contentsby these action or if our relationship with such third party deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed our business is highly competitive competition present an ongoing threat to the success of our business we compete with company that sell advertising well with company that provide social medium and communication product and service that are designed to engage user on mobile device and online we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including from company that facilitate communication and the sharing of content and information company that enable marketer to display advertising company that distribute video and other form of medium content and company that provide development platform for application developer we compete with company that offer product across broad platform that replicate capability we provide for example among other area we compete with apple in messaging google and youtube in advertising and video tencent and snap in messaging and social medium bytedance and twitter in social medium and amazon in advertising we also compete with company that provide regional social network and messaging product many of which have strong position in particular country some of our competitor may be domiciled in different country and subject to political legal and regulatory regime that enable them to compete more effectively than in addition we face competition from traditional online and mobile business that provide medium for marketer to reach their audience and or develop tool and system for managing and optimizing advertising campaign we also compete with company that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality product and service some of our current and potential competitor may have greater resource or stronger competitive position in certain product segment geographic region or user demographic than we do these factor may allow our competitor to respond more effectively than to new or emerging technology and change in market condition we believe that some user particularly younger user are aware of and actively engaging with other product and service similar to or substitute for our product and service and we believe that some user have reduced their use of and engagement with our product and service in favor of these other product and service in the event that user increasingly engage with other product and service we may experience decline in use and engagement in key user demographic or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitor may develop product feature or service that are similar to or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more far reaching and successful product development effort or marketing campaign or may adopt more aggressive pricing policy in addition developer whose mobile and web application are integrated with facebook or our other product may use information shared by our user through our product in order to develop product or feature that compete with some competitor may gain competitive advantage against in area where we operate including by making acquisition by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ad by imposing fee or other charge related to our delivery of ad by making access to our product more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our user or by integrating competing platform application or feature into product they control such mobile device operating system search engine browser or commerce platform for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive product with io and android respectively result our competitor may acquire and engage user or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own effort which may negatively affect our business and financial result in addition from time to time we may take action in response to competitive threat but we can not assure you that these action will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial result we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factor both within and beyond our control including the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our product compared to our competitor product the size and composition of our user base the engagement of user with our product and competing product the timing and market acceptance of product including development and enhancement to our or our competitor product our safety and security effort and our ability to protect user data and to provide user with control over their data of content our ability to distribute our product to new and existing user our ability to monetize our product the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ad displayed by or our competitor customer service and support effort marketing and selling effort including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ad and to provide marketer with compelling return on their investment our ability to establish and maintain developer interest in building mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other product change mandated by legislation regulatory authority or litigation some of which may have disproportionate effect on acquisition or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitor our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employee particularly software engineer designer and product manager our ability to cost effectively manage and grow our operation and our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitor if we are not able to compete effectively our user base and level of user engagement may decrease we may become le attractive to developer and marketer and our revenue and result of operation may be materially and adversely affected action by government that restrict access to facebook or our other product in their country or that otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their country could substantially harm our business and financial result government from time to time seek to censor content available on facebook or our other product in their country restrict access to our product from their country entirely or impose other restriction that may affect the accessibility of our product in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other product ha been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authority in other country may seek to restrict user access to our product if they consider to be in violation of their law or threat to public safety or for other reason and certain of our product have been restricted by government in other country from time to time it is possible that government authority could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in country where access to our consumer facing product may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from limited number of resellers representing advertiser based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our china based advertising revenue whether result of the trade dispute with the united state in response to content issue or otherwise or take other action against such imposing tax or other penalty which could adversely affect our financial result in the event that content shown on facebook or our other product is subject to censorship access to our product is restricted in whole or in part in one or more country or other restriction are imposed on our product or our competitor are able to successfully penetrate new geographic market or capture greater share of existing geographic market that we can not access or where we face other restriction our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketer may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue anticipated and our financial result could be adversely affected of contentsour new product and change to existing product could fail to attract or retain user or generate revenue and profit our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing product and to create successful new product both independently and in conjunction with developer or other third party we may introduce significant change to our existing product or acquire or introduce new and unproven product including using technology with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware product or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these product and technology we continue to incur substantial cost and we may not be successful in generating profit in connection with these effort in addition the introduction of new product or change to existing product may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny or other complication that could adversely affect our business and financial result we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resource in growing our whatsapp and messenger product to support increasing usage of such product we have historically monetized messaging in only limited fashion and we may not be successful in our effort to generate meaningful revenue or profit from messaging over the long term in addition we have announced plan to implement end to end encryption across our messaging service well facilitate interoperability these platform which plan have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdiction if our new or enhanced product fail to engage user marketer or developer or if our business plan are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain user or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investment and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decision that may not prioritize short term financial result and may not produce the long term benefit that we expect we frequently make product and investment decision that may not prioritize short term financial result if we believe that the decision are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have recently implemented and we will continue to implement change to our user data practice some of these change reduce our ability to effectively target ad which ha to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our off facebook activity tool enables user to place limit on our storage and use of information about their interaction with advertiser apps and website which will reduce our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ad to our user similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these change have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measure of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial result from time to time we may also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ad in order to improve ad quality and overall user experience in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other change to our product which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publisher marketer and developer and could reduce their incentive to invest in their effort on facebook we also may introduce new feature or other change to existing product or introduce new stand alone product that attract user away from property format or use case where we have more proven mean of monetization for example we plan to continue to promote the story format which is becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our product but our advertising effort with this format are still under development and we do not currently monetize story at the rate news feed in addition we focus on growing user and engagement across our family of product from time to time these effort have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more product and service in favor of other product or service that we monetize le successfully or that are not growing quickly these decision may adversely affect our business and result of operation and may not produce the long term benefit that we expect if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand our ability to expand our base of user marketer and developer may be impaired and our business and financial result may be harmed we believe that our brand have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of user marketer and developer many of our new user are referred by existing user maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative product which we may not do successfully we may introduce new product or term of service or policy that user do not like which may negatively affect our brand additionally the action of our developer or advertiser may affect our brand if user do not have positive experience using third party mobile and web application integrated with our product or interacting with party that advertise through our product we will also continue to experience medium legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our action or decision regarding user privacy encryption content advertising and other issue including action or decision in connection with election which may adversely affect our reputation and of contentsbrands for example in march we announced development regarding the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our service or objectionable practice by advertiser or developer or to otherwise address user concern which ha occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brand our brand may also be negatively affected by the action of user that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other user by the action of user acting under false or inauthentic identity by the use of our product or service to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinion by perceived or actual effort by government to obtain access to user information for security related purpose or to censor certain content on our platform or by the use of our product or service for illicit or objectionable end including for example any such action around the presidential election or other election around the world maintaining and enhancing our brand will require to make substantial investment and these investment may not be successful certain of our past action such the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data have eroded confidence in our brand and if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expense in this effort our business and financial result may be adversely affected security breach improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attack on our system or other cyber incident could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyber attack by third party seeking unauthorized access to our data or user data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our product and service involve the collection storage processing and transmission of large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breach and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from user or information from marketer could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware virus social engineering predominantly spear phishing attack and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry have occurred on our system in the past and will occur on our system in the future we also regularly encounter attempt to create false or undesirable user account purchase ad or take other action on our platform for purpose such spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable end result of our prominence the size of our user base the type and volume of personal data on our system and the evolving nature of our product and service including our effort involving new and emerging technology we believe that we are particularly attractive target for such breach and attack including from highly sophisticated state sponsored or otherwise well funded actor our effort to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attack such breach and attack may cause interruption to the service we provide degrade the user experience cause user or marketer to lose confidence and trust in our product impair our internal system or result in financial harm to our effort to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activity on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bug or other technical malfunction employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defect or vulnerability in our vendor information technology system or offering government surveillance breach of physical security of our facility or technical infrastructure or other threat that evolve in addition third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee or user to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our user data cyber attack continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long period of time although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable account and activity on our platform and to prevent or detect security breach we can not assure you that such measure will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in timely manner or that our remediation effort will be successful we experience cyber attack and other security incident of varying degree from time to time and we may incur significant cost in protecting against or remediating such incident in addition some of our developer or other partner such those that help measure the effectiveness of ad may receive or store information provided by or by our user through mobile or web application integrated with facebook we provide limited information to such third party based on the scope of service provided to however if these third party or developer fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our data or our user data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection well obligation under the modified consent order we entered into in july with the federal trade commission ftc which is pending federal court approval result affected user or government authority could initiate legal or regulatory action against in connection with any actual or perceived security breach or improper access to or disclosure of data which ha occurred in the past and which could cause to incur significant expense and liability or result in order or consent decree forcing to modify our business practice such incident or our effort to remediate such incident of contentsmay also result in decline in our active user base or engagement level any of these event could have material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial result for example in september we announced our discovery of third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token which were used to access certain profile information from approximately million user account on facebook while we took step to remediate the attack including fixing the vulnerability resetting user access token and notifying affected user we may discover and announce additional development which could further erode confidence in our brand in addition the event surrounding this cyber attack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiry any such inquiry could subject to substantial fine and cost require to change our business practice divert resource and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business we anticipate that our ongoing effort related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instance of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party on our platform in addition to our effort to mitigate cybersecurity risk we are making significant investment in privacy safety security and content review effort to combat misuse of our service and user data by third party including investigation and audit of platform application that previously accessed information of large number of user of our service result of these effort we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incident of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party we may not discover all such incident or activity whether result of our data limitation including our lack of visibility over our encrypted service the scale of activity on our platform or other factor and we may be notified of such incident or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our consent order with the ftc the medium or other third party such incident and activity have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our system in manner inconsistent with our term contract or policy the existence of false or undesirable user account election interference improper ad purchase activity that threaten people safety on or offline or instance of spamming scraping or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our effort to enforce our policy or otherwise remediate any such incident any of the foregoing development may negatively affect user trust and engagement harm our reputation and brand require to change our business practice in manner adverse to our business and adversely affect our business and financial result any such development may also subject to additional litigation and regulatory inquiry which could subject to monetary penalty and damage divert management time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight unfavorable medium coverage could negatively affect our business we receive high degree of medium coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practice term of service advertising policy product change product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the action of our advertiser the action of our developer whose product are integrated with our product the use of our product or service for illicit or objectionable end the substance or enforcement of our community standard the action of our user the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform or the action of other company that provide similar service to ours ha in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example beginning in march we were the subject of intense medium coverage involving the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy and we have continued to receive negative publicity in addition we may be subject to negative publicity if we are not successful in our effort to prevent the illicit or objectionable use of our product or service in connection with the presidential election or other election around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and result in decreased revenue which could adversely affect our business and financial result our financial result will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial result have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have limited operating history with the current scale of our business which make it difficult to forecast our future result result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial result indicator of future performance you should take into account the risk and uncertainty frequently encountered by company in rapidly evolving market our financial result in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factor many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement of content our ability to attract and retain marketer in particular period fluctuation in spending by our marketer due to seasonality such historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year episodic regional or global event or other factor the frequency prominence size format and quality of ad shown to user the success of technology designed to block the display of ad change to third party policy that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising the pricing of our ad and other product the diversification and growth of revenue source beyond advertising on facebook and instagram our ability to generate revenue from payment or the sale of our consumer hardware product or other product we may introduce in the future change to existing product or service or the development and introduction of new product or service by or our competitor user behavior or product change that may reduce traffic to feature or product that we successfully monetize increase in marketing sale and other operating expense that we will incur to grow and expand our operation and to remain competitive including cost related to our data center and technical infrastructure cost related to our privacy safety security and content review effort cost and expense related to the development and delivery of our consumer hardware product our ability to maintain gross margin and operating margin cost related to acquisition including cost associated with amortization and additional investment to develop the acquired technology charge associated with impairment of any asset on our balance sheet our ability to obtain equipment component and labor for our data center and other technical infrastructure in timely and cost effective manner system failure or outage or government blocking which could prevent from serving ad for any period of time breach of security or privacy and the cost associated with any such breach and remediation change in the manner in which we distribute our product or inaccessibility of our product due to third party action fee paid to third party for content or the distribution of our product refund or other concession provided to advertiser share based compensation expense including acquisition related expense of content adverse litigation judgment settlement or other litigation related cost change in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy and data protection or action by government or regulator including fine order or consent decree the overall tax rate for our business which may be affected by the mix of income we earn in the and in jurisdiction with comparatively lower tax rate the effect of share based compensation the effect of integrating intellectual property from acquisition and the effect of change in our business the impact of change in tax law or judicial or regulatory interpretation of tax law which are recorded in the period such law are enacted or interpretation are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period tax obligation that may arise from resolution of tax examination including the examination we are currently under by the internal revenue service irs that materially differ from the amount we have anticipated fluctuation in currency exchange rate and change in the proportion of our revenue and expense denominated in foreign currency trading activity in our share repurchase program fluctuation in the market value of our portfolio investment and in interest rate change in generally accepted accounting principle and change in global business or macroeconomic condition we expect our rate of growth to decline in the future we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time the size of our active user base increase and it is possible that the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more market particularly we achieve greater market penetration we expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time our revenue increase to higher level our growth rate decline investor perception of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class common stock could decline our cost are continuing to grow and some of our investment have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investment are not successful our business and financial performance could be harmed operating our business is costly and we expect our expense to continue to increase in the future we broaden our user base user increase the amount and type of content they consume and the data they share with for example with respect to video we develop and implement new product we market new and existing product and promote our brand we continue to expand our technical infrastructure we continue to invest in new and unproven technology and we continue to hire additional employee and contractor to support our expanding operation including our effort to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlement judgment fine or other monetary penalty in connection with legal and regulatory development that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investment in new platform and technology some of these investment particularly our significant investment in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability if our investment are not successful our ability to grow revenue will be harmed which could adversely affect our business and financial performance given our level of share based compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price the tax effect of the accounting for share based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share based compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefit that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in excess tax benefit recognized from share based compensation decreased our provision for income tax by million and our effective tax rate of contentsby one percentage point compared to the tax rate without such benefit in future period in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share based compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of share based compensation issued relative to our earnings in particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share based compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effect are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial result our business is subject to complex and evolving and foreign law and regulation regarding privacy data protection content competition consumer protection and other matter many of these law and regulation are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claim change to our business practice monetary penalty increased cost of operation or decline in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad that involve matter central to our business including privacy data protection and personal information right of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion electronic contract and other communication competition protection of minor consumer protection telecommunication product liability taxation economic or other trade prohibition or sanction anti corruption law compliance security law compliance and online payment service the introduction of new product expansion of our activity in certain jurisdiction or other action that we may take may subject to additional law regulation or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition and other law and regulation can impose different obligation or be more restrictive than those in the united state these federal and state and foreign law and regulation which in some case can be enforced by private party in addition to government entity are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change result the application interpretation and enforcement of these law and regulation are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policy and practice for example regulatory or legislative action affecting the manner in which we display content to our user or obtain consent to various practice could adversely affect user growth and engagement such action could affect the manner in which we provide our service or adversely affect our financial result we are also subject to law and regulation that dictate whether how and under what circumstance we can transfer process and or receive certain data that is critical to our operation including data shared between country or region in which we operate and data shared among our product and service for example in the european union and united state agreed to transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united state called the privacy shield but this framework is subject to an annual review that could result in change to our obligation and also is subject to challenge by regulator and private party including pending legal challenge by private party in addition the other base upon which facebook relies to legitimize the transfer of such data such standard contractual clause sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the irish data protection commissioner ha challenged the legal ground for transfer of user data to facebook inc and the irish high court ha referred this challenge to the court of justice of the european union for decision we have also been managing investigation and lawsuit in europe india and other jurisdiction regarding the august update to whatsapp term of service and privacy policy and it sharing of certain data with other facebook product and service including lawsuit currently pending the supreme court of india if one or more of the legal base for transferring data from europe to the united state is invalidated or the transfer framework are amended if we are unable to transfer data between and among country and region in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our product and service it could affect the manner in which we provide our service or our ability to target ad which could adversely affect our financial result proposed or new legislation and regulation could also significantly affect our business for example the european general data protection regulation gdpr took effect in may and applies to all of our product and service used by people in europe the gdpr includes operational requirement for company that receive or process personal data of resident of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union result we implemented measure to change our service for minor under the age of for certain country in europe that maintain the minimum age of under the gdpr we also obtain consent and or offer new control to existing and new user in europe before processing data for certain aspect of our service in addition the gdpr requires submission of personal data breach notification to our designated european privacy regulator the irish data protection commission and includes significant penalty for non compliance with the notification obligation well other requirement of the regulation the brazilian general data protection law will impose requirement similar to gdpr on product and service offered to user in brazil effective in august of contentsthe california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january also establishes certain transparency rule and creates new data privacy right for user including more ability to control how their data is shared with third party these law and regulation are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitation on our advertising service or reduction of advertising by marketer have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are number of legislative proposal in the european union the united state at both the federal and state level well other jurisdiction that could impose new obligation or limitation in area affecting our business in addition some country are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirement or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirement that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our service these law and regulation well any associated claim inquiry or investigation or any other government action have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcome including increased compliance cost delay or impediment in the development of new product negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating cost diversion of management time and attention and remedy that harm our business including fine or demand or order that we modify or cease existing business practice we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigation enforcement action and settlement and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceeding and other inquiry in the future which could cause to incur substantial cost or require to change our business practice in manner materially adverse to our business from time to time we receive formal and informal inquiry from government authority and regulator regarding our compliance with law and regulation many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigation inquiry data request request for information action and audit in the united state europe and around the world particularly in the area of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection and competition we continue to grow and expand our operation in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory order or consent decree for example data protection competition and consumer protection authority in the european union have initiated action investigation or administrative order seeking to restrict the way in which we collect and use information or impose sanction and other authority may do the same in addition beginning in march we became subject to ftc state attorney general and other government inquiry in the united state europe and other jurisdiction in connection with our platform and user data practice well the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy in july we entered into settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which is pending federal court approval among other matter our settlement with the ftc requires to pay penalty of billion and to significantly enhance our practice and process for privacy compliance and oversight beginning in september we also became subject to irish data protection commission idpc and other government inquiry in connection with third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook from time to time we also notify the idpc our designated european privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breach and privacy issue and are subject to inquiry and investigation regarding various aspect of our regulatory compliance in addition competition authority in the united state europe and other jurisdiction have initiated formal and informal inquiry and investigation into many aspect of our business including with respect to user and advertiser well our industry for example in june we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of we became the subject of antitrust inquiry and investigation by the department of justice the house of representative and state attorney general these inquiry and investigation concern among other thing our business practice in the area of social networking or social medium service digital advertising and or mobile or online application well past acquisition order issued by or inquiry or enforcement action initiated by government or regulatory authority could cause to incur substantial cost expose to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalty including substantial monetary remedy interrupt or require to change our business practice in manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resource and the attention of management from our business or subject to other remedy that adversely affect our business of contentscompliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirement will require significant operational resource and modification to our business practice and any compliance failure may have material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial result we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight effort including result of the modified consent order we entered into in july with the ftc well our effort to comply with the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirement around the world including the ccpa in particular we have agreed with the ftc to implement comprehensive expansion of our privacy program including substantial management and board of director oversight stringent operational requirement and reporting obligation and process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc which will be challenging and costly to implement we expect that these enhancement will result in both improved privacy compliance and oversight and the discovery of additional privacy issue at least in the near term and we expect to continue to notify the ftc of such issue from time to time in accordance with our reporting obligation under the consent order these compliance and oversight effort will increase demand on our system and resource and will require significant investment including investment in compliance process personnel and technical infrastructure in the near term we are reallocating resource internally to assist with these effort and this ha had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiative in addition these effort will require substantial modification to our business practice and make some practice such product and ad development more difficult time consuming and costly result we believe our ability to develop and launch new feature product and service in timely manner will be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight effort will require significant time and attention from our management and board of director in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirement are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandate of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa or other regulatory or legislative requirement or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other requirement we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigation or lawsuit which may result in significant monetary fine judgment or other penalty and we may also be required to make additional change to our business practice any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial result if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreement with our employee consultant and third party with we have relationship well trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection law to protect our proprietary right in the united state and internationally we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property and we currently hold significant number of registered trademark and issued patent in multiple jurisdiction and have acquired patent and patent application from third party third party may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary right third party may challenge proprietary right held by and pending and future trademark and patent application may not be approved in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business in any or all of these case we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our right although we have generally taken measure to protect our proprietary right there can be no assurance that others will not offer product or concept that are substantially similar to ours and compete with our business in addition we regularly contribute software source code under open source license and have made other technology we developed available under other open license and we include open source software in our product for example we have contributed certain specification and design related to our data center equipment to the open compute project foundation non profit entity that share and develops such information with the technology community under the open web foundation license result of our open source contribution and the use of open source in our product we may license or be required to license or disclose code and or innovation that turn out to be material to our business and may also be exposed to increased litigation risk if the protection of our proprietary right is inadequate to prevent unauthorized use or appropriation by third party the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and competitor may be able to more effectively mimic our product service and method of operation any of these event could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result we are currently and expect to be in the future party to patent lawsuit and other intellectual property right claim that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could have significant impact on our business financial condition or result of operation company in the internet technology and medium industry own large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and frequently enter into litigation based on allegation of infringement misappropriation or other violation of of contentsintellectual property or other right in addition various non practicing entity that own patent and other intellectual property right often attempt to aggressively assert their right in order to extract value from technology company furthermore from time to time we may introduce or acquire new product including in area where we historically have not competed which could increase our exposure to patent and other intellectual property claim from competitor and non practicing entity from time to time we receive notice from patent holder and other party alleging that certain of our product and service or user content infringe their intellectual property right we presently are involved in number of intellectual property lawsuit and we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claim against to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose significant burden on management and employee and there can be no assurance that favorable final outcome will be obtained in all case in addition plaintiff may seek and we may become subject to preliminary or provisional ruling in the course of any such litigation including potential preliminary injunction requiring to cease some or all of our operation we may decide to settle such lawsuit and dispute on term that are unfavorable to similarly if any litigation to which we are party is resolved adversely we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal the term of such settlement or judgment may require to cease some or all of our operation or pay substantial amount to the other party in addition we may have to seek license to continue practice found to be in violation of third party right which may not be available on reasonable term or at all and may significantly increase our operating cost and expense result we may also be required to develop alternative non infringing technology or practice or discontinue the practice the development of alternative non infringing technology or practice could require significant effort and expense could result in le effective technology or practice or otherwise negatively affect the user experience or may not be feasible we have experienced unfavorable outcome in such dispute and litigation in the past and our business financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected result of an unfavorable resolution of the dispute and litigation referred to above we are involved in numerous class action lawsuit and other litigation matter that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or result of operation in addition to intellectual property claim we are also involved in numerous other lawsuit including putative class action lawsuit many of which claim statutory damage and or seek significant change to our business operation and we anticipate that we will continue to be target for numerous lawsuit in the future because of the scale of our user base the plaintiff in class action case filed against typically claim enormous monetary damage even if the alleged per user harm is small or non existent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuit based on advertiser claim antitrust claim employment claim product performance or other claim related to the use of consumer hardware and software well virtual reality technology and product which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suit in connection with our platform and user data practice and the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy well the disclosure of our earnings result for the second quarter of we also recently agreed to settlement in principle to resolve certain lawsuit in connection with the tag suggestion facial recognition feature on facebook and third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook we believe the remaining lawsuit are without merit and are vigorously defending them however the result of such lawsuit and claim can not be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuit could result in payment of substantial monetary damage or fine or undesirable change to our product or business practice and accordingly our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurance that favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our case and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose significant burden on management and employee any litigation to which we are party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payment of substantial monetary damage or fine or we may decide to settle lawsuit on similarly unfavorable term which ha occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial condition or result of operation we may incur liability result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our product or result of claim related to our product and legislation regulating content on our platform may require to change our product or business practice we have faced currently face and will continue to face claim relating to information that is published or made available on our product in particular the nature of our business expose to claim related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoax discrimination intellectual property right right of publicity and privacy personal injury tort of contentsor law regulating hate speech or other type of content this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdiction outside the united state where our protection from liability for third party action may be unclear or where we may be le protected under local law than we are in the united state for example in april the european union passed directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain us of news content online which member state must implement by june in addition there have been various congressional effort to restrict the scope of the protection available to online platform under section of the communication decency act and our current protection from liability for third party content in the united state could decrease or change we could incur significant cost investigating and defending such claim and if we are found liable significant damage we could also face fine or order restricting or blocking our service in particular geography result of content hosted on our service for example legislation in germany ha in the past and may in the future result in the imposition of fine for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligation other country including australia france singapore and the united kingdom are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing penalty for failure to remove content or follow certain process such legislation also ha in the past and may in the future require to change our product or business practice increase our compliance cost or otherwise impact our operation or our ability to provide service in certain geography for example the european copyright directive requires certain online service to obtain authorization for copyrighted content or to implement measure to prevent the availability of that content which may require to make substantial investment in compliance process if any of the foregoing event occur our business and financial result could be adversely affected our ceo ha control over key decision making result of his control of majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting right with respect to majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore ha the ability to control the outcome of matter submitted to our stockholder for approval including the election of director and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our asset this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our asset that our other stockholder support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such transaction that our other stockholder do not support this concentrated control could also discourage potential investor from acquiring our class common stock which ha limited voting power relative to the class common stock and might harm the trading price of our class common stock in addition mr zuckerberg ha the ability to control the management and major strategic investment of our company result of his position our ceo and his ability to control the election or replacement of our director in the event of his death the share of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the person or entity that ha designated board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes fiduciary duty to our stockholder and must act in good faith in manner he reasonably belief to be in the best interest of our stockholder stockholder even controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his share and share over which he ha voting control governed by voting agreement in his own interest which may not always be in the interest of our stockholder generally we plan to continue to make acquisition which could harm our financial condition or result of operation and may adversely affect the price of our common stock part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisition to add specialized employee and complementary company product or technology we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidate and we may not be able to complete acquisition on favorable term if at all in some case the cost of such acquisition may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will receive favorable return on investment for our acquisition we may pay substantial amount of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisition which could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligation and increased interest expense and could also include covenant or other restriction that would impede our ability to manage our operation we may also issue equity security to pay for acquisition and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employee of acquired company which could increase our expense adversely affect our financial result and result in dilution to our stockholder in addition any acquisition we announce could be viewed negatively by user marketer developer or investor which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class common stock we may also discover liability or deficiency associated with the company or asset we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated cost the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the result of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statement and disclosure made of contentsor action taken by the company we acquire or their representative well the limited amount of time in which acquisition are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction including tax and accounting charge acquisition may also result in our recording of significant additional expense to our result of operation and recording of substantial finite lived intangible asset on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factor may adversely affect our financial condition or result of operation we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition and we may incur significant cost to integrate and support the company we acquire the integration of acquisition requires significant time and resource and we may not manage these process successfully our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisition is unproven particularly with respect to company that have significant operation or that develop product where we do not have prior experience for example the technology and product we acquired from oculus were relatively new to facebook at the time of the acquisition and we not have significant experience with or structure in place to support such technology and product prior to the acquisition we continue to make substantial investment of resource to support our acquisition which will result in significant ongoing operating expense and may divert resource and management attention from other area of our business we can not assure you that these investment will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the company we acquire we may not realize the benefit expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed if our goodwill or finite lived intangible asset become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings we review our finite lived intangible asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at least annually if such goodwill or finite lived intangible asset are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset would be recognized we may be required to record significant charge in our financial statement during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite lived intangible asset is determined which would negatively affect our result of operation our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service could damage our reputation result in potential loss of user and engagement and adversely affect our financial result our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our user is dependent upon the reliable performance of our product and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruption in the availability or performance of our product from time to time our system may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delay or outage that could be harmful to our business if our product are unavailable when user attempt to access them or if they do not load quickly expected user may not use our product often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ad may be disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance the amount and type of information shared on facebook and our other product continue to grow and evolve the usage pattern of our global community continue to evolve and our internal operational demand continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our need it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demand which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruption delay or failure resulting from earthquake adverse weather condition other natural disaster power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threat cyber attack or other catastrophic event if such an event were to occur user may be subject to service disruption or outage and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in timely manner to restart or provide our service which may adversely affect our financial result substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third party any disruption or failure in the service we receive from these provider could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulty these provider face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these provider which increase our vulnerability to problem with the service they provide of contentswe could experience unforeseen difficulty in building and operating key portion of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data center and key portion of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our product and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data center and other project the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves project in multiple location unanticipated delay in the completion of these project including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portion of such project or availability of component challenge in obtaining required government or regulatory approval or other geopolitical challenge or action by government may lead to increased project cost operational inefficiency or interruption in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our product in addition there may be issue related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phase of design and implementation which may only become evident we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our cost any of these event could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result our product and internal system rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and if these system contain error bug or vulnerability or if we are unsuccessful in addressing or mitigating technical limitation in our system our business could be adversely affected our product and internal system rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and or by third party that is highly technical and complex in addition our product and internal system depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amount of data the software and hardware on which we rely ha contained and will in the future contain error bug or vulnerability and our system are subject to certain technical limitation that may compromise our ability to meet our objective some error bug or vulnerability inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code ha been released for external or internal use for example in september we announced our discovery of third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook error bug vulnerability design defect or technical limitation within the software and hardware on which we rely have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcome including negative experience for user and marketer who use our product compromised ability of our product to perform in manner consistent with our term contract or policy delayed product introduction or enhancement targeting measurement or billing error compromised ability to protect the data of our user and or our intellectual property or reduction in our ability to provide some or all of our service for example we make commitment to our user to how their data will be used within and across our product and our system are subject to error bug and technical limitation that may prevent from fulfilling these commitment reliably if our system contain bug or error or if we do not properly address or mitigate the technical limitation in our system we may fail to fulfill our commitment to our user and be subject to regulatory scrutiny or litigation that could harm our business and result in fine damage or other remedy in addition error bug vulnerability or defect in the software and hardware on which we rely and any associated degradation or interruption of service have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcome including damage to our reputation loss of user loss of marketer loss of revenue regulatory inquiry or liability for damage any of which could adversely affect our business and financial result technology have been developed that can block the display of our ad which could adversely affect our financial result technology have been developed and will likely continue to be developed that can block the display of our ad or block our ad measurement tool particularly for advertising displayed on personal computer we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising including revenue resulting from the display of ad on personal computer revenue generated from the display of ad on personal computer ha been impacted by these technology from time to time result these technology have had an adverse effect on our financial result and if such technology continue to proliferate in particular with respect to mobile platform our future financial result may be harmed real or perceived inaccuracy in our community and other metric may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the number for our key metric which include our facebook metric daus maus and average revenue per user arpu and family metric dap map and average revenue per person arpp are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user account while these number are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimate of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenge in measuring usage of our product across large online and mobile population around the world the methodology used to measure these metric require significant judgment of contentsand are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimate of our user base and such estimate may change due to improvement or change in our methodology we regularly review our process for calculating these metric and from time to time we discover inaccuracy in our metric or make adjustment to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustment to our historical metric our ability to recalculate our historical metric may be impacted by data limitation or other factor that require to apply different methodology for such adjustment we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metric for any such inaccuracy or adjustment that are within the error margin disclosed below in addition our facebook metric and family metric estimate will differ from estimate published by third party due to difference in methodology we regularly evaluate our facebook metric to estimate the number of duplicate and false account among our maus duplicate account is one that user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false account into two category user misclassified account where user have created personal profile for business organization or non human entity such pet such entity are permitted on facebook using page rather than personal profile under our term of service and violating account which represent user profile that we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service such bot and spam the estimate of duplicate and false account are based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate account we use data signal such identical ip address and similar user name and to identify false account we look for name that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewer any loss of access to data signal we use in this process whether result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimate of duplicate and false account our estimate also may change our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology or product change that may allow to identify previously undetected duplicate or false account and may improve our ability to evaluate broader population of our user duplicate and false account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false account may vary significantly from our estimate in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate account is meaningfully higher in developing market such the philippine and vietnam compared to more developed market in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false account can vary result of episodic spike in the creation of such account which we have seen originate more frequently in specific country such indonesia and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of duplicate or false account among our user which may also reduce our dau and mau estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the number of duplicate and false account among our maus on an annual basis many people in our community have user account on more than one of our product and some people have multiple user account within an individual product accordingly for our family metric we do not seek to count the total number of user account across our product because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metric represent our estimate of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use common identifier or link their account to use multiple product in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people to calculate these metric we rely upon complex technique algorithm and machine learning model that seek to count the individual people behind user account including by matching multiple user account within an individual product and across multiple product when we believe they are attributable to single person and counting such group of account one person these technique and model require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitation discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variance and uncertainty we estimate the potential error in our family metric primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error well while we expect the error margin for our family metric to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people and it is possible that the actual number of unique people using our product may vary significantly from our estimate potentially beyond our estimated error margin result it is also possible that our family metric may indicate change or trend in user number that do not match actual change or trend of contentsto calculate our estimate of family dap and map we currently use series of machine learning model that are developed based on internal review of limited sample of user account and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these model and calculating these estimate for example to match user account within individual product and across multiple product we use data signal such similar device information ip address and user name we also calibrate our model against data from periodic user survey of varying size and frequency across our product which are inherently subject to error in addition our data limitation may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metric estimate our technique and model rely on variety of data signal from different product and we rely on more limited data signal for some product compared to others for example result of limited visibility into encrypted product we have fewer data signal from whatsapp user account and primarily rely on phone number and device information to match whatsapp user account with account on our other product similarly although messenger kid user are included in our family metric we do not seek to match their account with account on our other application for purpose of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signal we use in our process for calculating family metric whether result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metric our estimate of family metric also may change our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology product change or other improvement in our user survey algorithm or machine learning that may improve our ability to match account within and across our product or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our user in addition such evolution may allow to identify previously undetected violating account defined below we regularly evaluate our family metric to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account we define violating account account which we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service including bot and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating account such estimation is based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behavior associated with facebook and instagram account that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewer but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person ha one or more violating account we do not include such person in our violating account estimation long we believe they have one account that doe not constitute violating account from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of violating account among our user which may also reduce our dap and map estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account on an annual basis violating account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating account may vary significantly from our estimate other data limitation also may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business for example while user provided data indicates decline in usage among younger user this age data is unreliable because disproportionate number of our younger user register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our user is estimated based on number of factor such the user ip address and self disclosed location these factor may not always accurately reflect the user actual location for example user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user actual location the methodology used to measure our metric are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error and our estimate for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factor in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metric including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ad all of our metric are subject to software bug inconsistency in our system and human error if marketer developer or investor do not perceive our metric to be accurate or if we discover material inaccuracy in our metric we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketer and developer may be le willing to allocate their budget or resource to facebook or our other product which could negatively affect our business and financial result we can not assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employee increasing to of december from of december and we expect such headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire number of employee and contractor in order to address various privacy safety security and content review initiative the growth and expansion of our business of contentsand product create significant challenge for our management operational and financial resource including managing multiple relationship with user marketer developer and other third party our operation and the number of our third party relationship continue to grow our information technology system or our internal control and procedure may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some member of our management do not have significant experience managing large global business operation our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively to effectively manage our growth we must continue to improve our operational financial and management process and system and to effectively expand train and manage our personnel our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structure we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefit of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative product this could negatively affect our business performance the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg

particular we intend to continue to hire significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenge in hiring such personnel particularly in the san francisco bay area where our headquarters are located whether result of competition with other company challenge due to the high cost of living facility and infrastructure constraint or other factor we continue to mature the incentive to attract retain and motivate employee provided by our equity award or by future arrangement may not be effective in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employee or to retain our existing employee we would incur substantial additional share based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholder would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employee may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility result of these factor it may be difficult for to continue to retain and motivate our employee if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow

developer with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving balance that continues to attract and retain such developer for example from time to time we have taken action to reduce the volume of communication from these developer to user on facebook and our other product with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such action have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunity from mobile and web application integrated with our product in addition part of our effort related to privacy safety and security we are conducting investigation and audit of large number of platform application and we also have announced several product change that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instance these action well other action to enforce our policy applicable to developer have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationship with developer if we are not successful in our

or our industry including trade dispute if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operation successfully our financial result could be adversely affected of contentswe face design manufacturing and supply chain risk that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial result we face number of risk related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware product for example the consumer hardware product we sell may have quality issue resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other manufacturer or supplier if the quality of our consumer hardware product doe not meet our customer expectation or such product are found to be defective then our brand and financial result could be adversely affected we rely on third party to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware product we may experience supply shortage or other disruption in logistics or the supply chain in the future that could result in shipping delay and negatively impact our operation we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third party with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of such arrangement with them the manufacturing and sale of our consumer hardware product also may be negatively impacted by geopolitical challenge trade dispute or other action by government that subject to supply shortage increased cost or supply chain disruption we also require the supplier and business partner of our consumer hardware product to comply with law and certain company policy regarding sourcing practice and standard on labor health and safety the environment and business ethic but we do not control them or their practice and standard if any of them violates law fails to implement change in accordance with newly enacted law or implement practice or standard regarded unethical corrupt or non compliant we could experience supply chain disruption government action or fine canceled order or damage to our reputation we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware product we are exposed to inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware product result of rapid change in product cycle and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise change in consumer demand and consumer spending pattern change in consumer taste with respect to our consumer hardware product and other factor we endeavor to accurately predict these trend and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware product we may sell demand for product however can change significantly between the time inventory or component are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing new consumer hardware product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationship determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain type of inventory or component may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of these factor may adversely affect our operating result we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liability our tax obligation including income and non income tax are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangement including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuation of our intercompany transaction the tax law applicable to our business including the law of the united state and other jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdiction are aggressively interpreting their law in new way in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from company such facebook we are subject to regular review and audit by federal state and foreign tax authority tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken including our methodology for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangement and any adverse outcome of such review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow for example in and the irs issued formal assessment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the through tax year although we disagree with the irs position and are contesting this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in manner unfavorable to may adversely affect our financial result the determination of our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability requires significant judgment by management and there are many transaction where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income tax is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any change to such operation or law applicable to such operation may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income tax and estimate of our non income tax liability are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amount recorded in our financial statement of contentsand may materially affect our financial result in the period or period for which such determination is made our future income tax rate could be volatile and difficult to predict due to change in jurisdictional profit split change in the amount and recognition of deferred tax asset and liability or by change in tax law regulation or accounting principle change in tax law or tax ruling could materially affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow the tax regime we are subject to or operate under including income and non income tax are unsettled and may be subject to significant change change in tax law or tax ruling or change in interpretation of existing law could materially affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow for example the tax cut and job act tax act enacted in december had significant impact on our tax obligation and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of and the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act could materially affect our tax obligation and effective tax rate in the period issued in addition three judge panel from the ninth circuit court of appeal issued decision in altera corp commissioner regarding the treatment of share based compensation expense in cost sharing arrangement which had material effect on our tax obligation and effective tax rate for the second quarter of the taxpayer may appeal the decision to the supreme court of the united state the final outcome of the case is uncertain and could have material effect on our tax obligation and effective tax rate in future quarter in addition many country in europe well number of other country and organization have recently proposed or recommended change to existing tax law or have enacted new law that could significantly increase our tax obligation in many country where we do business or require to change the manner in which we operate our business the organization for economic cooperation and development ha been working on base erosion and profit shifting project and issued report in an interim report in and is expected to continue to issue guideline and proposal that may change various aspect of the existing framework under which our tax obligation are determined in many of the country in which we do business similarly the european commission and several country have issued proposal that would change various aspect of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposal include change to the existing framework to calculate income tax well proposal to change or impose new type of non income tax including tax based on percentage of revenue for example several country have proposed or enacted tax applicable to digital service which includes business activity on social medium platform and online marketplace and would likely apply to our business the european commission ha conducted investigation in multiple country focusing on whether local country tax ruling or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rule and concluded that certain country including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain case these investigation may result in change to the tax treatment of our foreign operation due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity many of these type of change to the taxation of our activity described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow such change may also apply retroactively to our historical operation and result in tax greater than the amount estimated and recorded in our financial statement we can not guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long term stockholder value share repurchase could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserve although our board of director ha authorized share repurchase program that commenced in and doe not have an expiration date the program doe not obligate to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of share of our class common stock we can not guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long term stockholder value

therefore are able to control all matter submitted to our stockholder for approval so long the share of class common stock represent at least of all outstanding share of our class and class common

share converting to class common stock subject to limited exception such certain transfer effected for estate planning or charitable purpose the conversion of class common stock to class common stock will have the effect over time of increasing the relative voting power of those holder of class common stock who retain their share in the long term if for example mr zuckerberg retains significant

revenue from user who are not also facebook or messenger maus wa not material the geography of our user affect our revenue and financial result because we currently monetize user in different geography at different average rate our revenue and arpu in region such united state canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising market for example arpu in in the united state canada region wa more than time higher than in the asia pacific region note our revenue by facebook user geography in the chart above is

represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period wa an increase of from over this period arpu increased by in the united state canada in europe in asia pacific and in rest of world in addition user growth wa more rapid in geography with relatively lower arpu such asia pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those region where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increase in each geographic region

financial statement are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis our estimate are based on historical experience and various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result could differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumption about matter that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made if different estimate reasonably could have been used or if change in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statement we believe that the assumption and estimate associated with income tax loss contingency and valuation of long lived asset including goodwill and intangible asset and their associated estimated useful life have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policy and estimate for further information on all of our significant accounting policy see note summary of significant accounting policy in the accompanying note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report on form income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax and income tax asset and liability including evaluating uncertainty in the application of accounting principle and complex tax law we record provision for income tax for the anticipated tax consequence of the reported result of operation using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset and liability are measured using the tax rate that are expected to apply to taxable income for the year in which those tax asset and liability are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effect of change in tax rate in the period of the enactment we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical level of income expectation and risk associated with estimate of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategy in assessing the need for valuation allowance we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position these uncertain tax position include our estimate for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analysis of appropriate arm length price similarly our estimate related to uncertain tax position concerning research tax credit are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activity supporting the tax credit will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position including net interest and penalty we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matter will not be materially different we make adjustment to these reserve in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when fact and circumstance change such the closing of tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter is different from the amount recorded such difference will affect the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made and could have material impact on our financial condition and operating result loss contingencieswe are involved in legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matter include speculative claim for substantial or indeterminate amount of damage we evaluate the associated development on regular basis and accrue liability when we believe that it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is reasonable possibility that we may incur loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement to the extent material of contentswe review the development in our contingency that could affect the amount of the provision that have been previously recorded and the matter and related reasonably possible loss disclosed we make adjustment to our provision and change to our disclosure accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiation settlement ruling advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss the outcome of these matter is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matter were resolved against for amount in excess of management expectation our result of operation and financial condition including in particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note commitment and contingency and note income tax of the accompanying note to our consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data and part item legal proceeding of this annual report on form for additional information regarding these contingency valuation of long lived asset including goodwill intangible asset and estimated useful life we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired user acquired technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable asset and liability affect our amortization expense acquired finite lived intangible asset are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below it carrying value of december no impairment of goodwill ha been identified long lived asset including property and equipment and intangible asset are reviewed for possible impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability recoverability of these asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of such asset is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charge during the year presented the useful life of our long lived asset including property and equipment and finite lived intangible asset are determined by management when those asset are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful life the current estimate of useful life represents our best estimate based on current fact and circumstance but may differ from the actual useful life due to change in future circumstance such change to our business operation change in the planned use of asset and technological advancement when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically change in useful life have not resulted in material change to our depreciation and amortization expense of

instagram messenger and third party affiliated website or mobile application marketer pay for ad product either directly or through their relationship with advertising agency or resellers based on the

price per ad decreased by compared with an increase of approximately in the decrease in average price per ad wa primarily driven by an increasing proportion of the number of ad delivered story ad and in geography that monetize at lower rate we anticipate that future advertising revenue growth will be determined by combination of the number of ad delivered and price advertising spending is traditionally seasonally strong in the fourth quarter of each year we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affect our quarterly result which generally reflect significant growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarter and decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first quarter for instance our advertising revenue increased and between the third and fourth quarter of and respectively while advertising revenue for both the first quarter of and declined and compared to the fourth quarter of and respectively no customer represented or more of total revenue during the year ended december and foreign exchange impact on revenue the general strengthening of the dollar relative to certain foreign currency in the full year compared to

ninth circuit of contentson june the ninth circuit issued an opinion altera ninth circuit opinion that reversed the tax court decision based on the altera ninth circuit opinion we recorded cumulative income tax expense of billion in the second quarter of on july the taxpayer requested rehearing before the full ninth circuit and the request wa denied on november the taxpayer ha until february to request hearing before the supreme court of the united state result the final outcome of the case is uncertain in november we made billion payment related to this matter and recorded the payment to net against the tax liability included within other liability in our consolidated balance sheet if the altera ninth circuit opinion is reversed we would anticipate recording an income tax benefit at that time effective tax rate item our effective tax rate in the future will depend upon the proportion of our income before provision for income tax earned in the united state and in jurisdiction with

settlement of tax contingency item tax effect of change in our business and the impact of change in tax law the proportion of our income before provision for income tax earned in jurisdiction with tax rate lower than the statutory rate will depend upon the proportion of revenue and cost associated with the respective jurisdiction the accounting for share based compensation may increase or decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share based compensation expense and the deduction taken on our tax return which depends upon the stock price at the time of employee award vesting if our stock price remains constant to the january price we expect our effective tax rate for will be in the high teen the range reflects expected effect from transfer of intellectual property right between facebook entity that we anticipate implementing in integrating intellectual property from acquisition into our business generally involves intercompany transaction that have the impact of increasing our provision for income tax consequently our provision for income tax and our effective tax rate may initially increase in the period of an acquisition and integration the magnitude of this impact will depend upon the specific type size and taxing jurisdiction of the intellectual property well the relative contribution to income in subsequent period unrecognized tax benefit of december we had net unrecognized tax benefit of billion which were accrued other liability these unrecognized tax benefit were predominantly accrued for uncertainty related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary which includes licensing of intellectual property providing service and other transaction well for uncertainty with our research tax credit the ultimate settlement of the liability will depend upon resolution of tax audit litigation or event that would otherwise change the assessment of such item based upon the status of litigation described below and the current status of tax audit in various jurisdiction we do not anticipate material change to such amount within the next month in july we received statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the tax year while the notice applies only to the tax year the irs stated that it will also apply it position for tax year subsequent to we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed petition in the tax court challenging the notice the case is scheduled for trial beginning in february on january the irs filed it pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the irs did not provide any information about how it intends to apply the revised adjustment to future year based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in it updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately billion in excess of the amount in our originally filed return plus interest and any penalty asserted in march we received second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our through tax year the irs applied it position from the tax year to each of these year and also proposed new adjustment related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary and certain tax credit that we claimed if the irs prevails in it position for these new adjustment this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately million in excess of the amount in our originally filed return plus interest and any penalty asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs in the second notice and have filed petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income tax that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the position taken by the irs in the two notice and it pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in it position related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition of contentstax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax cut and job act tax act of december we have not resolved these matter and proceeding continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amount have been reserved in accordance with asc income tax for any adjustment to the provision for income tax or other tax item that may ultimately result from these examination the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audit is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit could significantly change in the next month given the number of year remaining that are subject to examination in various jurisdiction we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustment to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit if the taxing authority prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalty if any could have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation and cash flow of

capitalization were not material to date income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax and income tax asset and liability including evaluating uncertainty in the application of accounting principle and complex tax law we record provision for income tax for the anticipated tax consequence of the reported result of operation using the asset and liability method under this method we recognize deferred income tax asset and liability for the expected future consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well for loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset and liability are measured using the tax rate that are expected to apply to taxable income for the year in which those tax asset and liability are expected to be realized or settled we recognize the deferred income tax effect of change in tax rate in the period of the enactment we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized we consider all available evidence both positive and negative including historical level of income expectation and risk associated with estimate of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategy in assessing the need for valuation allowance we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position these uncertain tax position include our estimate for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analysis of appropriate arm length price similarly our estimate related to uncertain tax position concerning research tax credit are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activity supporting the tax credit will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position including net interest and penalty we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matter will not be materially different we make adjustment to these reserve in accordance with the income tax guidance when fact and circumstance change such the closing of tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter is different from the amount recorded such difference will affect the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made and could have material impact on our financial condition and operating result advertising expenseadvertising cost are expensed when incurred and are

cash and cash equivalent marketable security and restricted cashcash and cash equivalent consist of cash on deposit with bank and highly liquid investment with maturity of day or le from the date of purchase we hold investment in marketable security consisting of government security government agency security and investment grade corporate debt security we classify our marketable security available for sale investment in our current asset because they represent investment of cash available for current operation our available for sale investment are carried at estimated fair value with any unrealized gain and loss net of tax included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholder equity unrealized loss are charged against interest and other income net when decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary we have not recorded any such impairment charge in the period of contentspresented we determine realized gain or loss on sale of marketable security on specific identification method and record such gain or loss interest and other income net we also maintain multi currency notional cash pool for our participating entity with third party bank provider actual cash balance are not physically converted and are not commingled between participating legal entity we classify the overdraft balance within accrued expense and other current liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we classify certain restricted cash balance within prepaid expense and other current asset and other asset on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet based upon the term of the remaining restriction fair value of financial instrumentswe apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and non financial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on recurring basis we define fair value the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the input used to measure fair value into three level and base the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable input other than quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in inactive market or other input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level input that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimate of assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability our valuation technique used to measure the fair value of cash equivalent and marketable debt security were derived from quoted market price or alternative pricing source and model utilizing observable market input account receivable and allowancesaccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount le an allowance for any potential uncollectible amount we make estimate for the allowance for doubtful account and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment of various factor including historical experience the age of the account receivable balance credit quality of our customer current economic condition and other factor that may affect our ability to collect from customer property and equipmentproperty and equipment which includes amount recorded under finance lease are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term whichever is shorter the estimated useful life of property and equipment are described below property and equipment useful life network equipment three to yearsbuildings three to yearscomputer software office equipment and other two to five yearsfinance lease right of use asset three to yearsleasehold improvement lesser of estimated useful life or remaining lease term of contentsthe useful life of our property and equipment are determined by management when those asset are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful life our current estimate of useful life represents the best estimate of the useful life based on current fact and circumstance but may differ from the actual useful life due to change in future circumstance such change to our business operation change in the planned use of asset and technological advancement when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life historically change in useful life have not resulted in material change to our depreciation and amortization expense land and asset held within construction in progress are not depreciated construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use the cost of maintenance and repair is expensed incurred when asset are retired or otherwise disposed of the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective account and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in income from operation lease obligationson january we adopted accounting standard update no lease topic asu using the modified retrospective transition approach by applying the new standard to all lease existing at the date of initial application result and disclosure requirement for reporting period beginning after january are presented under topic while prior period amount have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting under topic we elected the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance which allowed to carryforward our historical lease classification our assessment on whether contract wa or contains lease and our initial direct cost for any lease that existed prior to january we also elected to combine our lease and non lease component and to keep lease with an initial term of month or le off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payment in the consolidated statement of income on straight line basis over the lease term additionally for certain equipment lease we apply portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right of use rou asset and lease liability upon adoption we recognized total rou asset of billion with corresponding lease liability of billion on the consolidated balance sheet this included million of pre existing finance lease rou asset previously reported in the network equipment within property and equipment net the rou asset include adjustment for prepayment and accrued lease payment the adoption did not impact our beginning retained earnings or our prior year consolidated statement of income and statement of cash flow under topic we determine if an arrangement is lease at inception rou asset and lease liability are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payment over the lease term for this purpose we consider only payment that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payment our incremental borrowing rate is hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be the rou asset also includes any lease payment made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentive received our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such option when determining the probability of exercising such option we consider contract based asset based entity based and market based factor our lease agreement may contain variable cost such common area maintenance insurance real estate tax or other cost variable lease cost are expensed incurred on the consolidated statement of income our lease agreement generally do not contain any residual value guarantee or restrictive covenant operating lease are included in operating lease rou asset operating lease liability current and operating lease liability non current on our consolidated balance

involved in legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matter include speculative claim for substantial or indeterminate amount of damage we evaluate the development on regular basis and accrue liability when we believe that it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is reasonable possibility that we may incur loss and the loss or range of loss can be estimated we disclose the possible loss in the note to the consolidated financial statement to the extent material we review the development in our contingency that could affect the amount of the provision that ha been previously recorded and the matter and related possible loss disclosed we make adjustment to our provision and change to our disclosure accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiation settlement ruling advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss business combinationswe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired user acquired technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable asset and liability affect company amortization expense acquired finite lived intangible asset are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings long lived asset including goodwill and other acquired intangible assetswe evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and acquired finite lived intangible asset for possible impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability recoverability of these asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of such asset is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any significant impairment charge during the year presented we review goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our single reporting unit below it carrying value of december no impairment of goodwill ha been identified acquired finite lived intangible asset are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset we routinely review the remaining estimated useful life of property and equipment and finite lived intangible asset if we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized or depreciated over the revised estimated useful life foreign currencygenerally the functional currency of

filed it pretrial memorandum in the case stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the irs did not provide any information about

of up to approximately million in excess of the amount in our originally filed return plus interest and any penalty asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs in the second notice and have filed petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income tax that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the position taken by the irs in the two notice and of contentsits pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in it position related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax act of december we have not resolved these matter and proceeding continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amount have been reserved in accordance with asc for any adjustment to the provision for income tax or other tax item that may ultimately result from these examination the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audit is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit could significantly change in the next month given the number of year remaining that are subject to examination we are
