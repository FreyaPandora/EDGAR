condition and result of operation and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factor do not identify all risk that we face our operation could also be affected by factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operation due to risk and uncertainty known and unknown our past financial result may not be reliable indicator of future performance and historical trend should not be used to anticipate result or trend in future period refer also to the other information set forth in this annual report on form including management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and our financial statement and the related note change in product demand can adversely affect our financial result demand for our product is variable and hard to predict change in the demand for our product may reduce our revenue increase our cost lower our gross margin percentage or require to write the value of our asset our platform product are used across different market segment and demand for our platform may vary within or among our client computing data center internet of thing and other market segment it is difficult to anticipate the impact of these change demand may increase in one or more market segment while decreasing in others important factor that could lead to variation in the demand for our product include change in business condition including downturn in the computing industry or in the global or regional economy consumer confidence or income level caused by change in market condition including change in government borrowing taxation or spending policy the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity price the level of our customer inventory competitive and pricing pressure including action taken by competitor customer product need market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing product and the technology supply chain including supply constraint caused by natural disaster or other event we face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market development change in industry standard change in customer need and frequent product introduction and improvement if we do not anticipate and respond to these development our competitive position may weaken and our product or technology might be uncompetitive or obsolete additionally number of business combination including merger asset acquisition and strategic partnership in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several year and more could occur in the future consolidation in the industry could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result in recent year our business focus ha expanded and includes the design and production of platform and other product for the data center internet of thing and memory market segment including fpga product connectivity product and number of other product and service for wide range of connected device result we face new source of competition including in certain of these market segment from incumbent competitor with established customer base and greater brand recognition to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationship with customer and partner in these market segment in addition we must continually improve the cost integration and energy efficiency of our product well expand our software capability to provide customer with comprehensive computing solution despite our ongoing effort there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain consumer and market demand or acceptance for our product and service in these various market segment of contentsto compete successfully we must maintain successful effort develop new product and production process and improve our existing product and process ahead of competitor for example we invest substantially in our network of manufacturing and assembly and test facility including the construction of new fabrication facility to support smaller transistor geometry and larger wafer our effort are critical to our success and are aimed at solving complex problem and we do not expect all of our project to be successful we may be unable to develop and market new product successfully and the product we invest in and develop may not be well received by customer our investment may not generate significant operating income or contribute to our future operating result for several year and such contribution may not meet our expectation or even cover the cost of such investment additionally the product and technology offered by others may affect demand for or pricing of our product if we are not able to compete effectively our financial result will be adversely affected including increased cost and reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the write down of the value of certain asset change in the mix of product sold may harm our financial result our pricing and margin vary across our product and market segment due to difference in product feature or manufacturing cost for example our platform product offering range from lower priced and entry level platform such those based on intel quark or intel atom processor to higher end platform based on intel xeon processor if demand shift from our higher priced to lower priced platform in any of our market segment our gross margin and revenue would decrease in addition when product are introduced they tend to have higher cost because of initial development cost and lower production volume relative to the previous product generation which can impact gross margin we operate globally and are subject to significant risk in many jurisdiction global or regional condition may harm our financial result we have manufacturing assembly and test sale and other operation in many country and some of our business activity may be concentrated in one or more geographic area moreover sale outside the accounted for approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december result our operation and our financial result including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell product may be adversely affected by number of factor outside of our control including global and local economic condition geopolitical and security issue such armed conflict and civil or military unrest crime political instability human right concern and terrorist activity natural disaster public health issue and other catastrophic event inefficient infrastructure and other disruption such supply chain interruption and large scale outage or unreliable provision of service from utility transportation data hosting or telecommunication provider government restriction on or nationalization of our operation in any country or restriction on our ability to repatriate earnings from particular country differing employment practice and labor issue formal or informal imposition of new or revised export and or import and doing business regulation including trade sanction and tariff which could be changed without notice ineffective legal protection of our ip right in certain country local business and cultural factor that differ from our normal standard and practice and increased uncertainty regarding social political immigration and trade policy in the and abroad such recent legislation and policy and the united kingdom referendum to withdraw from the european union brexit we are subject to law and regulation worldwide which may differ among jurisdiction affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement anti corruption foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement anti competition advertising employment product regulation environment health and safety requirement and consumer law compliance with such requirement may be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operation negatively although we have policy control and procedure designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier and or agent will not violate such law or our policy violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation of contentswe may be affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate we are potentially exposed to adverse well beneficial movement in currency exchange rate although most of our sale occur in dollar expense may be paid in local currency an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar could increase the cost of expense such payroll utility tax and marketing expense well overseas capital expenditure we also conduct certain investing and financing activity in local currency our hedging program reduce but do not eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movement therefore change in exchange rate could harm our result of operation and financial condition catastrophic event or geopolitical condition could have material adverse effect on our operation and financial result our operation or system could be disrupted by natural disaster industrial accident geopolitical condition terrorist activity public health issue cybersecurity incident interruption of service from utility transportation or telecommunication provider or other catastrophic event such event could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver product to our customer receive production material from our supplier or perform critical function which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation while we maintain business recovery plan that are intended to enable to recover from natural disaster or other event that can be disruptive to our business some of our system are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plan will fully protect from all such disruption we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decision with respect to risk retention some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion in addition one or more of our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk due to the variability in demand for our product and the complexity of our manufacturing operation we may be unable to timely respond to fluctuation in demand our operation have high cost that are either fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our cost related to manufacturing such facility construction and equipment and the employment and training of highly skilled workforce if product demand decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write inventory or record excess capacity charge which would lower our gross margin our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our long lived asset which would increase our expense factory planning decision may shorten the useful life of facility and equipment and cause to accelerate depreciation conversely if product demand increase we may be unable to add capacity fast enough to meet market demand our revenue and gross margin can also be affected by the timing of our product introduction and related expense including marketing expense we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology we may not be successful or efficient in developing or implementing new production process production of integrated circuit is complex process we are continually engaged in the transition from our existing process to the next generation process technology this consistent innovation involves significant expense and carry inherent risk including difficulty in designing and developing next generation process technology development and production timing delay lower than anticipated manufacturing yield and product defect and erratum disruption in the production process can also result from error defect in material delay in obtaining or revising operating permit and license interruption in our supply of material or resource and disruption at our fabrication and assembly and test facility due to accident maintenance issue or unsafe working condition all of which could affect the timing of production ramp and yield production issue can lead to increased cost and may affect our ability to meet product demand which could adversely impact our business and the result from operation of contentswe face supply chain risk thousand of supplier provide material and equipment that we use in production and other aspect of our business where possible we seek to have several source of supply for all of those material however for certain material we may rely on single or limited number of supplier or upon supplier in single location in addition consolidation among supplier could impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the product and service available to the inability of supplier to deliver adequate supply of production material or other supply could disrupt our production process or make it more difficult for to implement our business strategy production could be disrupted by the unavailability of resource used in production such water silicon electricity gas and other material the unavailability or reduced availability of material or resource may require to reduce production or incur additional cost which could harm our business and result of operation our manufacturing operation and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our supplier where an injunction against intel or supplier could interrupt the availability of good or service supplied to intel by others we also rely on third party provider to manufacture and assemble and test certain component or product particularly those related to networking mobile and communication programmable semiconductor solution and nand flash memory if any of these third party are unable to perform these service on timely or cost effective basis we may encounter supply delay or disruption that could adversely affect our financial result in addition there are regulatory and other requirement restriction and request from various constituency regarding sourcing practice and supplier conduct with trend toward expanding the scope of material and location where material originate regulating supplier behavior and increasing the required disclosure regarding such matter by public company increased regulation and public pressure in this area would cause our compliance cost to increase and could negatively affect our reputation given that we use many material in the manufacturing of our product and rely on many supplier to provide these material but do not directly control their procurement or employment practice we are subject to the risk of product defect erratum or other product issue product defect and erratum deviation from published specification may result from problem in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test process component and product we purchase or license from third party supplier or attain through acquisition may also contain defect we could face risk if product that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defect or erratum these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology or application through the internet of thing including wearable drone and transportation and industrial and consumer us cost from defect erratum or other product issue could include writing off some or all of the value of inventory recalling product that have been shipped providing product replacement or modification reimbursing customer for certain cost they incur defending against litigation and or paying resulting damage and paying fine imposed by regulatory agency these cost could be large and may increase expense and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue any product defect erratum or other issue could also damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product release or result in legal liability the announcement of product defect or erratum could cause customer to purchase product from competitor result of possible shortage of our component or for other reason any of these occurrence could harm our business and financial result in addition although we maintain liability insurance our coverage ha certain exclusion and or may not adequately cover liability incurred our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim and loss not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition we are subject to risk associated with environmental law and regulation the manufacturing and assembly and test of our product require the use of hazardous material that are subject to broad array of environmental health and safety law and regulation our failure to comply with these law or regulation could result in regulatory penalty fine and legal liability suspension of production alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test process reputational challenge and restriction on our operation or sale of contentsour failure to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous material could lead to increased cost or future liability our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulation such air quality and wastewater requirement environmental law and regulation could also require to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product design or incur other expense many new material that we are evaluating for use in our operation may be subject to regulation under environmental law and regulation these restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter manufacturing and assembly and test process climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risk that could harm our result of operation and affect the way we conduct business for example climate change regulation could result in increased manufacturing cost associated with air pollution control requirement and increased or new monitoring recordkeeping and reporting of greenhouse gas emission we also see the potential for higher energy cost driven by climate change regulation if for example utility company pas on their cost to their customer furthermore many of our operation are located in semi arid region that may become increasingly vulnerable to prolonged drought due to climate change our fabrication facility require significant water use and while we recycle and reuse portion of the water used we may have difficulty obtaining sufficient water to fulfill our operational need due the lack of available infrastructure we are subject to ip

management program may include equity derivative with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrant equity option or other equity derivative we also utilize total return swap to offset

estimate and judgment that affect the amount reported in our consolidated financial statement and the accompanying note the actual result that we experience may differ materially from our estimate during our annual assessment of the useful life of our property plant and equipment we determined that the estimated useful life of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facility should be increased from to year based on the lengthening of the process technology cadence resulting in longer node transition on both nanometer nm and product we have also increased the re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology this change in estimate wa applied prospectively effective at the beginning of during this change increased our operating income by approximately billion our net income by approximately million and our diluted earnings per share by approximately note accounting policy revenue recognitionwe recognize net product revenue when the earnings process is complete evidenced by an agreement delivery ha occurred pricing is deemed fixed and collection is considered probable we record pricing allowance including discount based on contractual arrangement with customer when we recognize revenue reduction to both account receivable and net revenue because of frequent sale price reduction and rapid technology obsolescence in our industry we defer product revenue and related cost of sale from component sale made to distributor under agreement allowing price protection or right of return until the distributor sell the merchandise the right of return granted generally consists of stock rotation program in which distributor are able to exchange certain product based on the number of qualified purchase made by the distributor under the price protection program we give distributor credit for the difference between the original price paid and the current price that we offer we include shipping charge billed to customer in net revenue and include the related shipping cost in cost of sale revenue from license agreement on our mcafee product generally includes service and support agreement for which the related revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in which service are provided revenue derived from online subscription product is deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period

component cost associated with product revenue and sale commission are deferred and recognized over the same period that the related revenue is recognized of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement continued inventorieswe compute inventory cost on first in first basis we apply judgment in the valuation of our inventory which includes the following critical accounting estimate intel ha product development life cycle that corresponds with substantive engineering milestone these engineering milestone are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activity and associated cost change in nature from research and development to cost of sale this impact the timing of when manufacturing cost can be capitalized inventory for product to be manufactured in high volume and sold to our customer under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specification this milestone is known product release qualification prq we have identified prq the point at which the cost incurred to manufacture our product are included in the valuation of inventory prior to prq cost that do not meet the criterion for are included in cost of sale in the period incurred if the point at which we estimate that inventory meet prq criterion change in the future the timing and recognition of the manufacturing cost would shift between and cost of sale to determine which manufacturing overhead cost can be included in the valuation of inventory we must determine what normal capacity level are at our manufacturing and assembly and test facility based on historical loading compared to total available capacity if the factory loading are below the established normal capacity level portion of our manufacturing overhead cost would not be included in the cost of inventory therefore it would be recognized cost of sale in that period which would negatively impact our gross margin we refer to these cost excess capacity charge inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market based upon assumption about future demand and market condition product specific fact and circumstance reviewed in the inventory valuation process include review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle of our product and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost inventory reserve increased by approximately million in compared to the valuation of inventory also requires to estimate obsolete and excess inventory well inventory that is not of saleable quality the demand forecast is utilized in the development of our short term manufacturing plan to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decision the estimate of future demand is compared to work in process and finished good inventory level to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory if our demand forecast for specific product is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we could be required to write off inventory which would negatively impact our gross margin property plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset and we capitalize interest on borrowing related to eligible capital expenditure capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified asset and depreciated together with that asset cost we record capital related government grant earned reduction to property plant and equipment we apply judgment in the valuation of our property plant and equipment which includes the following critical accounting estimate the estimated economic useful life of our property plant and equipment can materially impact our depreciation expense accordingly at least annually we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of these asset considering factor such the process technology cadence between node transition and re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology we had change in estimate in related to the useful life of machinery and equipment in our wafer fabrication facility for further information see note basis of presentation we make manufacturing process conversion and other factory planning decision we use assumption involving the use of management judgment regarding the remaining useful life of asset primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tool and building improvement when we determine that the useful life of asset are shorter than we had originally estimated we accelerate the rate of depreciation to reflect the asset new shorter useful life of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement continued we ass property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factor that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of business or product line in relation to expectation significant negative industry or economic trend and significant change or planned change in our use of the asset we measure the recoverability of asset that we will continue to use in our operation by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flow arising from the use of that asset grouping if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping carrying value and it fair value we have certain facility included within construction in progress being held in safe state and not currently in use that we have plan to place into service at future date the time at which these asset are placed into service depends on our existing manufacturing capacity market demand for our product and where we are in the transition of product on our roadmap management make judgment about the timing of when these facility will be readied for their intended use and placed into service for the manufacturing of our product depreciation is not recognized on these asset and they are not eligible for capitalized interest when construction is on hold fair valuefair value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we consider assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial asset are measured and recorded at fair value except for cost method investment cost method loan receivable equity method investment grant receivable and reverse repurchase agreement with original maturity greater than three month the three level of input that may be used to measure fair value are level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability we evaluate security specific market data when determining whether market is active level observable input other than level price such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price in le active market or model derived valuation all significant input used in our valuation such discounted cash flow are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability we use libor based yield curve currency spot and forward rate and credit rating significant input in our valuation level input also include non binding market consensus price well quoted price that were adjusted for security specific restriction when we use non binding market consensus price we corroborate them with quoted market price for similar instrument or compare them to output from internally developed pricing model such discounted cash flow model level unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of asset or liability we monitor and review the input and result of these valuation model to help ensure the fair value measurement are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset class level input also include non binding market consensus price or non binding broker quote that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data our policy is to reflect transfer between the fair value hierarchy level at the beginning of the period cash equivalentswe consider all highly liquid debt investment with original maturity from the date

investment include marketable debt instrument when the interest rate and foreign currency risk are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criterion for designation trading asset are not met we record the interest income and realized gain or loss on the sale of these instrument in interest and other net marketable equity security when there is no plan to sell or hedge the investment at the time of original classification we acquire these equity investment to promote business and strategic objective we record the realized gain or loss on the sale or exchange of marketable equity security in gain loss on equity investment net non marketable and other equity investmentswe regularly invest in non marketable equity instrument of private company which range from early stage company that are often still defining their strategic direction to more mature company with established revenue stream and business model the carrying value of our non marketable equity

gain loss on equity investment net non marketable cost method investment when the equity method doe not apply significant judgment is required to identify whether an impairment exists in the valuation of our non marketable equity investment portfolio and therefore we consider this critical accounting estimate our quarterly analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant impact on the investee fair value qualitative analysis of our investment involves understanding the financial performance and near term prospect of the investee change in general market condition in the investee industry or geographic area and the management and governance structure of the investee quantitative assessment of the fair value of our investment are developed using the market and income approach the market approach includes the use of comparable financial metric of private and public company and recent financing round the income approach includes the use of discounted cash flow model which requires significant estimate regarding the investees revenue cost and discount rate our assessment of these factor in determining whether an impairment exists could

continued credit riskfinancial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist principally of investment in debt instrument derivative financial instrument loan receivable reverse repurchase agreement and trade receivables we may enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty we generally place investment with high credit quality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty relative credit standing required per our investment policy substantially all of our investment in debt instrument and financing receivables are in investment grade instrument credit rating criterion for derivative instrument are similar to those for other investment due to master netting arrangement the amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instrument are generally

and past collection experience for more information about the customer that represent our account receivable balance see note operating segment and geographic information in part ii item of this form we have adopted credit policy and standard intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe that credit risk are moderated by the financial stability of our major customer we ass credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limit and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection device such obtaining parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance business combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition we consider this critical accounting estimate because it involves number of assumption estimate and judgment that could materially affect the timing or amount recognized in our financial statement the most subjective area include determining the fair value of the following intangible asset including valuation methodology estimation of future cash flow and discount rate well the estimated useful life of the intangible asset deferred tax asset and liability uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance which are initially estimated of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment pre existing liability or legal claim deferred revenue and contingent consideration each may be applicable and goodwill measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed our assumption and estimate are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired company we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination of contentsintel corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement continued goodwillapplication of the goodwill impairment test is considered critical accounting estimate including the identification of reporting unit assignment of asset and liability to reporting unit assignment of goodwill to reporting unit and determination of fair value for each reporting unit we perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist which includes evaluating qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment of reporting unit goodwill the reporting unit carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash investment and debt for reporting unit in which this assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is more than it carrying value goodwill is not considered impaired and we are not required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test qualitative factor considered in this assessment include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit additionally part of this assessment we may perform quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factor above by applying sensitivity to assumption and input used in measuring reporting unit fair value for reporting unit in which the impairment assessment concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is le than it carrying value we perform the first step of the goodwill impairment test which compare the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value if the carrying value of the net asset assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit then we must perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill our goodwill impairment test considers both the income method and the market method to estimate reporting unit fair value the income method is based on discounted future cash flow approach that us the following major assumption and input revenue based on assumed market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share estimated cost and appropriate discount rate based on reporting unit weighted average cost of capital determined by considering the observable weighted average cost of capital of comparable company our estimate of market segment growth our market segment share and cost are based on historical data various internal estimate and variety of external source the same estimate are also used in our business planning and forecasting process we test the reasonableness of the input and outcome of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data the market method is based on financial multiple and transaction price of comparable company although there were no specific qualitative indicator of impairment for our reporting unit we elected to perform step impairment test in the fourth quarter of these reporting unit were all deemed to have fair value that substantially exceeded their carrying value upon any reorganization of our operating segment we re evaluate our reporting unit and if necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value approach identified intangible assetswe amortize all acquisition related intangible asset that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life based on economic benefit acquisition related in process asset represent the fair value of incomplete project that had not reached technological feasibility of the date of acquisition initially these are classified in process research and development that are not subject to amortization these project are completed the asset balance are transferred from in process research and development to acquisition related developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward the asset balance relating to project that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to we perform quarterly review of significant finite lived identified intangible asset to determine whether fact and circumstance indicate that the useful life is shorter than we had originally estimated or that the carrying amount of asset may not be recoverable we consider the assumption and estimate used to determine future value and remaining useful life of our intangible and other long lived asset critical accounting estimate they can be affected by various factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our forecast for specific product line our annual impairment assessment occurs in the fourth quarter of each year for indefinite lived intangible asset or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable if necessary quantitative impairment test is performed to compare the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset with it carrying value impairment if any are based on the excess of the carrying amount

determinable we record any excess in cash paid to customer over the fair value of the advertising benefit we receive reduction in revenue advertising cost including direct marketing cost recorded within mg expense were billion in billion in and billion in employee equity incentive planswe use the straight line attribution method to recognize share based compensation over the service period of the award upon exercise cancellation forfeiture or expiration of stock option or upon vesting or forfeiture of restricted stock unit rsus we eliminate deferred tax asset for option and rsus with multiple vesting date for each vesting period on first in first out basis if each vesting period were separate award income taxeswe compute the provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax asset and liability using the currently enacted tax rate that apply to taxable income in effect for the year in which those tax asset are expected to be realized or settled we apply judgment in the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax which includes the following critical accounting estimate we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet recovery of portion of our deferred tax asset is impacted by management plan with respect to holding or disposing of certain investment therefore change in management plan with respect to holding or disposing of investment could affect our future provision for tax we use two step process to recognize liability for uncertain tax position the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether based on the technical merit of the position the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any if we determine that tax position will more likely than not be sustained on examination the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we consider many factor when evaluating and estimating our tax position and tax benefit which may require periodic adjustment and may not accurately forecast actual outcome we recognize interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit within the provision for tax on the consolidated statement of income determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment such change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision we have not recognized deferred income tax on certain undistributed non earnings because we plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the remittance of non earnings are based on estimate and judgment of projected cash flow need well the working capital and investment requirement of our non and operation material change in our estimate of cash working capital and investment need in various jurisdiction could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non earnings which would be subject to income tax and applicable non income and withholding tax loss contingencieswe are subject to loss contingency including various legal and regulatory proceeding asserted and potential claim liability related to repair or replacement of part in connection with product defect well product warranty and potential asset impairment that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingency is recognized charge to income if it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether loss is reasonably estimable critical accounting estimate we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and we may revise our estimate of contentsintel corporationnotes to

applied by reporting company under gaap under the new model recognition of revenue occurs when customer obtains control of promised good or service in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service in addition the new standard requires that reporting company disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer effective in the first quarter of we plan to adopt the standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application modified retrospective approach our assessment ha identified change in revenue recognition timing on our component sale made to distributor we expect to recognize revenue when we deliver to the distributor rather than deferring recognition until the distributor sell the component on the date of initial application we will remove the deferred net revenue on component sale made to distributor through cumulative adjustment to retained earnings we expect the revenue deferral historically recognized in the following period to be offset by the acceleration of revenue recognition control of the product transfer to our customer our assessment ha also identified change in expense recognition timing related to payment we make to our customer for distinct service they perform part of cooperative advertising program we expect to recognize the expense for cooperative advertising in the period the marketing activity occur we currently recognize the expense in the period the customer is entitled to participate in the program which coincides with the period of sale on the date of initial adoption we will capitalize the expense of cooperative advertising not performed through cumulative adjustment to retained earnings we expect the recognition of capitalized advertising to offset the deceleration in expense recognition until the marketing service are performed we will continue our assessment operate parallel system and process well finalize our evaluation of any change to our accounting policy and disclosure this excludes our planned divestiture
