year to finalize the outcome of these negotiation could result in among other thing transportation delay fewer good transported globally additional volatility in currency exchange rate and further regulation relating to among other thing trade aviation and the transport of good any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our industry is rapidly evolving we expect to continue to face significant competition which could adversely affect our industry is rapidly evolving including demand for faster delivery and increased visibility into shipment we expect continued significant competition on local regional national and international basis our competitor include the postal service of the and other nation various motor carrier express company freight forwarders air courier large transportation and commerce company that are making significant investment in their capability and start ups and other company that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need of whom may currently be our customer competition may also come from other source in the future including new technology are developed competitor have cost and organizational structure that differ from and from time to time may offer service or pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer additionally to remain competitive from time to time we may have to raise price and our customer may not be willing to accept these higher price if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressure we could be adversely affected continued transportation industry consolidation may further increase competition result of consolidation competitor may increase their market share improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive position business combination could also result in competitor providing wider variety of service and product at competitive price which could adversely affect change in our relationship with any of our significant customer including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have material adverse effect on for the year ended december one customer amazon com and it affiliate accounted for of our consolidated revenue some of our other significant customer can account for relatively significant portion of our revenue in particular quarter or year these customer can impact our revenue based on factor such customer product launch commerce or other industry trend such the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business combination and the overall growth of customer underlying business well any disruption to their business these customer could choose to divert all or portion of their business with to one of our competitor demand pricing concession for our service require to provide enhanced service that increase our cost or develop their own shipping and distribution capability in addition certain of our significant customer contract include termination right of either party upon the occurrence of certain event or without cause upon advance notice to the other party if all or portion of our business relationship with one or more significant customer were to terminate or be canceled it could materially adversely affect business is subject to complex and stringent law regulation and policy which could increase our operating cost we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment safety privacy and data protection and other governmental law regulation and policy both in the and in other country in which we operate in addition we are impacted by law regulation and policy that affect global trade including tariff and trade policy export requirement tax monetary policy and other restriction and charge recently trade discussion between the and various of it trading partner have been fluid and existing and future trade agreement are and are expected to continue to be subject to number of uncertainty including the imposition of new tariff or adjustment and change to the product covered by existing tariff the impact of new law regulation and policy or decision or interpretation by authority applying those law and regulation can not be predicted compliance with any new law or regulation may increase our operating cost or require significant capital expenditure any failure to comply with applicable law regulation or policy in the or in any of the other country in which we operate could result in substantial fine or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operation which could adversely affect increased security requirement impose substantial cost on and we could be the target of an attack or have security breach which could materially adversely affect result of concern about global terrorism and homeland security government around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirement that will result in increased operating cost for business in the transportation industry these requirement may change periodically result of regulatory and legislative requirement and in response to evolving threat we can not determine the effect that any new requirement will have on our cost structure or our operating result and new rule or other future security requirement may increase our cost of operation and reduce operating efficiency regardless of our compliance with security requirement or the step we take to secure our facility or fleet we could also be the target of an attack or security breach could occur which could materially adversely affect increasingly stringent regulation related to climate change could materially increase our operating cost regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emission expose our transportation and logistics business to potentially significant new tax fee and other cost compliance with such regulation and any increased or additional regulation or the associated cost is further complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change for example in the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission under this decision all of our flight operating within the european union are covered by the ets requirement and we are required annually to purchase emission allowance in an amount exceeding the number of free allowance allocated to under the ets similarly in the international civil aviation organization icao passed resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia which is global market based emission offset program to encourage carbon neutral growth beyond pilot phase is scheduled to begin in in which country may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in icao continues to develop detail regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating cost in the congress in the past several year ha considered various bill that would regulate ghg emission but these bill so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment nevertheless some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency epa spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act could determine to regulate ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission and this could impose substantial cost on in november the began the process to withdraw from the paris climate accord an agreement among country to reduce ghg emission the effect of that withdrawal on future policy regarding ghg emission on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other country implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on we may face additional regulation regarding ghg emission internationally and in the united state potential cost to of increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely we can not predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating result it is possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating cost and that we may not be willing or able to pas such cost along to our customer moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air service work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect many of our employee are employed under national master agreement and various supplemental agreement with local union affiliated with the teamster our airline pilot airline mechanic ground mechanic and certain other employee are employed under other collective bargaining agreement in addition some of our international employee are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreement strike work stoppage or slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our ability to meet our customer need result customer may reduce their business or stop business with if they believe that such action or threatened action may adversely affect our ability to provide service we may face permanent loss of customer if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could materially adversely affect the term of future collective bargaining agreement also may affect our competitive position and result of operation we are exposed to the effect of changing fuel and energy price including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruption in supply of these commodity changing fuel and energy cost have significant impact on our operation we require significant quantity of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicle and are exposed to the risk associated with variation in the market price for petroleum product including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel price through our indexed fuel surcharge and through hedging transaction from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge higher fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset change in fuel cost with surcharge high fuel surcharge may result in mix shift from our higher yielding air product to lower yielding ground product or an overall reduction in volume there can also be no assurance that hedging transaction will be effective to protect from change in fuel price moreover we could experience disruption in energy supply result of war action by producer or other factor beyond our control which could have material adverse effect on change in exchange rate or interest rate may have material adverse effect on we conduct business across the globe with significant portion of our revenue derived from operation outside the united state our operation in international market are affected by change in the exchange rate for local currency and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we are exposed to change in interest rate primarily on our short term debt and that portion of our long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting our debt is discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report additionally change in interest rate impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of change in interest rate on our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and cost is discussed further in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of this report we monitor and manage our exposure to change in currency exchange rate and interest rate and use derivative instrument to mitigate the impact of change in these rate on our financial position and result of operation however change in exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted or hedged and may have material adverse effect on the proposed phase out of the london interbank offer rate libor could have an adverse effect on certain of our debt and other financial instrument have interest rate tied to libor the head of the united kingdom financial conduct authority ha announced the desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of there is currently no definitive information regarding the future utilization of libor or any particular replacement rate such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital can not be determined in addition any further change or reform to the determination or supervision of libor may result in sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported libor which could have an adverse impact on extension of credit held by and could have material adverse effect on to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could adversely impact our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customer service quality issue actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customer to use other company also adverse publicity surrounding labor relation environmental concern security matter political activity and similar matter or attempt to connect our company to such issue either in the united state or other country in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and use of our service by customer social medium accelerates and amplifies the scope of negative publicity and make responding to negative claim more difficult damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have material adverse effect on and could require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand significant data breach or it system disruption could materially adversely affect including requiring to increase spending on data and system security we rely heavily on information technology network and system including the internet and number of internally developed system and application to manage or support wide variety of important business process and activity throughout our operation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data our franchised center location and business we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology system to manage their business process and activity in addition the provision of service to our customer and the operation of our network and system involve the collection storage and transmission of significant amount of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customer employee and others to conduct our operation we regularly move data across national border and consequently we are subject to variety of continuously evolving and developing law and regulation in the united state and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the law that may be applicable to is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign law for example the european union general data protection regulation gdpr which greatly increase the jurisdictional reach of european union law and add broad array of requirement for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breach became effective in may other country have enacted or are enacting data localization law that require data to stay within their border all of these evolving compliance and operational requirement impose significant cost that are likely to increase over time our information technology system well those of our franchisees and acquired business are susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to programming error defect or other vulnerability power outage hardware failure computer virus cyber attack ransomware attack malware attack theft misconduct by employee or other insider telecommunication failure misuse human error or other catastrophic event hacker foreign government cyber terrorist and cyber criminal acting individually or in coordinated group may launch distributed denial of service attack or other coordinated attack that may cause service outage gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to system or information or result in other interruption in our business in addition the foregoing breach in security could expose our customer and franchisees or the individual affected to risk of loss disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customer employee and others the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized launched against target result we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate measure to prevent any of the event described we also depend on and interact with the information technology network and system of third party for many aspect of our business operation including our customer and franchisees and service provider such cloud service provider and third party delivery service these third party may have access to information we maintain about our company operation customer employee and vendor or operating system that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operation like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach and it system disruption like those described above and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close down their network or system security process protocol and standard that we have implemented and contractual provision requiring security measure that we may have sought to impose on such third party may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such event these event could result in unauthorized access to or disruption or denial of access to misuse or disclosure of information or system that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information of these event that impact our information technology network or system or those of acquired business franchisees customer service provider or other third party could result in disruption in our operation the loss of existing or potential customer damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny and litigation and potential liability for among other consequence our customer confidence in our ability to protect data and system and to provide service consistent with their expectation could be impacted further disrupting our operation similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable or foreign data protection regulation or other data protection standard may expose to litigation fine sanction or other penalty we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan the cost and operational consequence of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measure could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threat despite our best effort we are not fully insulated from data breach and system disruption although to date we are unaware of data breach or system disruption including cyber attack that ha been material to we can not provide any assurance that such event and impact will not be material in the future and our effort to deter identify mitigate and or eliminate future breach may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster could adversely affect severe weather condition and other natural or manmade disaster including storm flood fire earthquake epidemic pandemic conflict unrest or terrorist attack may disrupt our business and result in decreased revenue customer may reduce shipment or our cost to operate our business may increase either of which could have material adverse effect on any such event affecting one of our major facility could result in significant interruption in or disruption of our business we make significant capital investment in our business of which significant portion is tied to projected volume level we require significant capital investment in our business consisting of aircraft vehicle technology facility and sorting and other type of equipment these investment support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factor which are subject to uncertainty such general economic trend change in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment need we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenue and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirement we adjust other element of our operation and cost structure in response to adverse economic condition however these adjustment may not be sufficient to allow to maintain our operating margin economic political social development and other risk associated with international operation could adversely affect we have significant international operation result we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social development that are beyond our control emerging market are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broad based downturn in these market could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we are subject to many law governing our international operation including those that prohibit improper payment to government official and commercial customer and restrict where we can do business our shipment to certain country and the information that we can provide to non government our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risk associated with our international operation could materially adversely affect we are subject to change in market and our business plan that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial write down of the carrying value of our asset thereby reducing our net income our regular review of the carrying value of our asset ha resulted from time to time in significant impairment and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charge change in business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment of our intangible fixed or other asset at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charge if we determine that the useful life of our fixed asset or intangible asset are shorter than we originally estimated such change have in the past and may in the future reduce our net income health and retiree health and pension benefit cost represent significant expense to further cost increase could materially and adversely affect our expense relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefit are significant in recent year we have experienced significant increase in some of these cost largely result of economic factor beyond our control including in particular ongoing increase in healthcare cost well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rate that we use to value our benefit plan obligation continually increasing healthcare cost volatility in investment return and discount rate well change in law regulation and assumption used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expense may adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or require significant contribution to our benefit plan our national master agreement with the teamster includes provision that are designed to mitigate certain of these healthcare expense but there can be no assurance that our effort will be successful or that the failure or success of these effort will not materially adversely affect we participate in number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plan for employee covered under collective bargaining agreement part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit level we have agreed to contribute certain amount to the multiemployer benefit plan during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plan set benefit level and are responsible for benefit delivery to participant future contribution amount to multiemployer benefit plan will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contribution beyond the agreed upon amount however in future collective bargaining negotiation we could agree to make significantly higher future contribution to improve the funded status of one or more of these plan the funded status of these multiemployer plan is impacted by various factor including investment performance healthcare inflation change in demographic and change in participant benefit level at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contribution if any or whether any material adverse effect on could result from our participation in these plan in addition to our on going multiemployer pension plan obligation we may have significant additional exposure with respect to benefit earned in the central state pension fund the cspf for additional information on our potential additional liability related to the cspf see note to the audited consolidated financial statement we may have additional tax liability we are subject to income tax in the and many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the united state tax cut and job act the tax act may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for it provision many aspect of the tax act remain unclear and may not be clarified for some time in addition many state jurisdiction continue to issue guidance on the state treatment of certain aspect of the tax act regulation and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act our result may differ from previous estimate and may materially affect our tax rate and our financial position we are regularly under audit by tax authority in different jurisdiction economic and political pressure to increase tax revenue in various jurisdiction may make resolving tax dispute more difficult although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable the final determination of tax audit and any related litigation in the jurisdiction where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provision and accrual in addition change in federal and state or international tax law applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law change currently being considered by many country and change in taxing jurisdiction administrative interpretation decision policy and position may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flow we may be subject to various claim and lawsuit that could result in significant expenditure the nature of our business expose to the potential for various claim and litigation related to labor and employment personal injury property damage business practice environmental liability and other matter any material litigation or catastrophic accident or series of accident could result in significant expenditure and have material adverse effect on our inability to effectively integrate acquired operation and realize the anticipated benefit of acquisition joint venture or strategic alliance could adversely affect part of our business strategy we may acquire business and form joint venture or strategic alliance whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these transaction depends in part upon the successful integration between the business involved the performance of the underlying operation capability or technology and the management of the acquired operation accordingly our financial result could be materially adversely affected by

to manage cost we continually adjust our air and ground network to better match higher volume level in addition we continue to deploy and utilize technology to increase package sorting and delivery productivity by reducing manual touchpoints the growth in pickup and delivery and network operational cost wa impacted by several factor higher employee compensation and benefit cost largely resulting from volume growth which resulted in an increase in average daily union labor hour of union pay rate and benefit increase and growth in the overall size of the workforce due to facility expansion we incurred higher employee benefit expense due to additional headcount contractual contribution rate increase to union multiemployer plan and change in benefit eligibility for certain union employee these increase were slightly offset by lower pension expense for our company sponsored plan due to higher discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation which reduced service cost and lower premium due to improved funded status we incurred slightly lower fuel expense for the year driven by decline in fuel price and higher alternative fuel tax credit in due to the passage of additional legislation these reduction were partially offset by increased network volume which resulted in higher fuel usage aircraft block hour increased daily package delivery stop increased and daily delivery mile increased lower cost for outside contract carrier were the result of retaining additional volume within our network total cost per piece which includes transformation strategy cost

the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term the cost of operating our integrated international air and ground network decreased million for the decrease in network cost wa primarily driven by decrease in aircraft

involve higher degree of judgment and complexity contingenciesas discussed in note to the audited consolidated financial statement we are involved in various legal proceeding and subject to various contingency the event that may impact our contingent liability are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time contingency is identified we consider all relevant fact part of our evaluation we record liability for loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs from our previously estimated liability this difference could be material income tax and self insurance are discussed below except disclosed in note to the audited consolidated financial statement other contingent loss that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or result of operation of or for the year ended december in addition we have certain contingent liability that have not been recognized of or for the year ended december because loss wa not reasonably estimable goodwill and intangible impairmentwe test goodwill for impairment in each

ismea in our supply chain freight segment we have the following reporting unit forwarding logistics ups mail innovation ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics our annual goodwill impairment testing date is july for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow dcf model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make number of significant assumption to produce an estimate of future cash flow these assumption include projection of future revenue cost capital expenditure and working capital change well assumption about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variable the projection that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition for each of our reporting unit the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves significant level of judgment in these assumption and change in our business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition could significantly impact these judgment we routinely monitor market condition and other factor to determine if interim impairment test are necessary if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation none of the reporting unit incurred any goodwill impairment charge in or change in our forecast could cause carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed their fair value in future period potentially resulting in goodwill impairment charge during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumption used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the period presented no triggering event were identified that required an interim impairment test based on most recent test the fair value of all our reporting unit exceed their carrying value parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsa trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are considered to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized impairment test for indefinite lived intangible are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds it fair value this valuation approach requires that we make number of assumption to estimate fair value these assumption include projection of future revenue market royalty rate tax rate discount rate and other relevant variable the projection we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition all of our remaining recorded intangible asset are deemed to be finite lived intangible and are amortized over their estimated useful life impairment test for these intangible asset are only performed when triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on dcf model if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation impairment of finite lived intangible asset were and million in and respectively there were no impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset in or self insurance accrualswe self insure cost associated with worker compensation claim automobile liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well loss estimate for claim that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balance are based on third party actuarial estimate which incorporate historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of our reserve worker compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in healthcare cost the result of any related litigation and with respect to worker compensation claim and change in legislation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from actuarial projection all of these factor can result in revision to actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result based on our historical experience during we changed our self insurance reserve from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of loss we believe our estimated reserve for such claim are adequate actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimate and affect our result of operation for additional information on our self insurance reserve refer to note of the audited consolidated financial statement we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee liability and expense related to these plan are based on estimate of among other thing the number of employee and eligible dependent covered under the plan anticipated medical usage by participant and overall trend in medical cost and inflation we believe our estimate are reasonable appropriate actual experience may differ from these estimate and therefore produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result pension and postretirement medical benefitsour pension and other postretirement benefit cost are calculated using various actuarial assumption and methodology these assumption include discount rate healthcare cost trend rate inflation compensation increase rate expected return on plan asset mortality rate and other factor the assumption utilized in recording the obligation under our plan represent our best estimate and we believe that they are reasonable based on information to historical experience and performance well other factor that might cause future expectation to differ from past trend parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsdifferences in actual experience or change in assumption may affect our pension and other postretirement obligation and future expense the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss each year are change in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligation of the measurement date difference between the expected and the actual return on plan asset change in demographic assumption including mortality participant experience different from demographic assumption and change in coordinating benefit with plan not sponsored by ups in october we refined the bond matching approach used to determine the discount rate for our pension and postretirement plan by implementing advance in technology and modeling technique this refinement decreased the projected benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet by approximately million of december decreased the pre tax mark to market charge by approximately million and increased net income by million or per share on basic and diluted basis we recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and net actuarial gain or loss in excess of corridor defined of the greater of the fair value of plan asset or the plan projected benefit obligation in pension expense annually at december each year the remaining component of pension expense herein referred to ongoing net periodic benefit cost

for coordinating benefit related to the central state pension fund parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsdepreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assetsas of december we had billion of net fixed asset the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed asset we make estimate of the expected useful life the expected residual value and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the asset and the cash flow which they generate in estimating the life and expected residual value of aircraft we rely upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft type revision to these estimate could be caused by change to our maintenance program change in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulation on aging aircraft and changing market price of new and used aircraft of the same or similar type we periodically evaluate these estimate and assumption and adjust them necessary adjustment are accounted for on prospective basis through depreciation expense in we revised our estimate of the useful life and residual value for certain airframe engine and related rotable part this change increased the useful life of certain fleet type and reduced the useful life and residual value of the majority of our used aircraft the net impact to depreciation expense wa not material in estimating cash flow we project future volume level for our different air product in all geographic region in which we do business adverse change in these volume forecast or shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projection could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of particular aircraft resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or reduction of the expected life of an aircraft thus resulting in increased depreciation expense we evaluate the useful life of our property plant and equipment based on our usage maintenance and replacement policy and taking into account physical and economic factor that may affect the useful life of the asset part of our ongoing investment in transformation in we revised our estimate of useful life for building improvement vehicle and plant equipment based on our current assessment of these factor in general these change in estimate had the effect of lengthening the useful life of vehicle building improvement and plant equipment and were applied prospectively beginning in through depreciation expense see consolidated operating expense of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for the discussion of the impact to depreciation and amortization see note to the audited consolidated financial statement for discussion of our accounting policy and note for discussion of the change in estimated useful life we review long lived asset for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal appropriate we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified the circumstance that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow loss associated with the use of the asset there were no impairment charge on our property plant and equipment during or fair value measurementsin the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instrument that contain element of market risk including derivative marketable security finance receivables pension asset other investment and debt certain of these financial instrument are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivative marketable security pension asset and certain other investment fair value are based on listed market price when such price are available to the extent that listed market price are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factor including dealer price quotation if listed market price or other relevant factor are not available input are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumption and include situation where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability certain financial instrument including over the counter derivative instrument are valued using pricing model that consider among other factor contractual and market price correlation time value credit spread and yield curve volatility factor change in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity market will impact our estimate of fair value in the future potentially affecting our result of operation quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationscertain non financial asset and liability are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis including property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible asset these asset are not measured at fair value on recurring basis however they are subject to fair value adjustment in certain circumstance such when there is evidence of an impairment for acquisition we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired customer technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable result actual result may differ from estimate during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings income taxeswe make certain estimate and judgment in determining income tax expense for financial statement purpose these estimate and judgment occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credit benefit and deduction and in the calculation of deferred tax asset and liability which arise from difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose well tax interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position significant change to these estimate may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in subsequent period we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover substantial majority of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet however should there be change in our ability to recover our deferred tax asset our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery wa not likely the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any once it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from position filed or to be filed with the tax authority is recorded liability for uncertain tax benefit it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision see note to the audited consolidated financial statement

forward contract option and swap discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instrument and further disclosure are provided in note to the audited consolidated financial statement commodity price riskwe are exposed to change in the price of refined fuel principally jet diesel and unleaded gasoline well change in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuel currently the fuel surcharge that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl service are the primary mean of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price change in order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharge imposed on by outside carrier we regularly adjust the rate we charge for our freight brokerage inter modal and truckload service the majority of our contract for fuel purchase utilize index based pricing formula plus or minus fixed locational supplier differential while many of the index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for fuel because of this our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term additionally we periodically use combination of option forward and future contract to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy price of december and however we had no commodity contract outstanding foreign currency exchange riskwe have foreign currency risk related to our revenue operating expense and financing transaction in currency other than the local currency in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential change in functional currency value of our

for period of to month we also utilize forward contract to hedge portion of our anticipated cash settlement of intercompany transaction and interest payment on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement interest rate riskwe have issued debt instrument including debt associated with finance lease that accrue expense at fixed and floating rate of interest we use combination of interest rate swap part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing the notional amount interest payment and maturity

embedded in our existing financial instrument we utilize valuation model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate interest rate yield curve and commodity and equity price for option and instrument with non linear return model appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shift there are certain limitation inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rate change in parallel fashion and that interest rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario these estimate should not be viewed forecast we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive asset and liability in response to change in market condition additionally change in the fair value of foreign currency derivative and commodity derivative are offset by change in the cash flow of the underlying hedged

evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statement we believe that our audit provide reasonable basis for our opinion critical audit mattersthe critical audit matter communicated below are matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statement that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that relate to account or disclosure that are material to the financial statement and involved our especially challenging subjective or complex judgment the communication of critical audit matter doe not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statement taken whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which they relate state pension fund coordinating benefit obligation assumption refer to note company sponsored employee benefit plan actuarial assumption central state pension fund to the financial statementscritical audit matter descriptionthe company wa contributing employer to the central state pension fund cspf until when it withdrew and fully funded it allocable share of unvested benefit the company agreed to provide coordinating benefit in the ups ibt full time employee pension plan ups ibt plan to cspf participant whose last employer wa the company and who had not retired of january the ups transfer group if the cspf were to lawfully reduce benefit consistent with the term of it withdrawal agreement with the company the cspf ha asserted that absent legislative reform it will become insolvent in if the cspf were to become insolvent consistent with that assertion the company may be required to provide coordinating benefit through the ups ibt plan to the ups transfer group under accounting standard generally accepted in the united state of america gaap the company is required to determine it best estimate of the eventual outcome of this matter and is prohibited from anticipating potential change in law in making that best estimate the company considered potential outcome based on the existing legislative framework including the eventual insolvency of the cspf or an approved application to reduce benefit under the multiemployer pension reform act mpra the company can not consider legislative solution when making it best estimate of it projected benefit obligation the company belief the trustee of the cspf the trustee would be more likely to pursue an application to reduce benefit under the mpra than they would be to allow the insolvency of the cspf based upon this possible outcome the company developed assumption related to the order in which benefit would be reduced to group of participant under mpra whether cspf can reduce benefit to the ups transfer group under mpra without the company consent the timing and effective date of mpra application and the actuarial assumption associated with the timing of future cspf cash flow based on the company deterministic cash flow projection management recorded projected benefit obligation of billion for the cspf coordinating benefit at december given that the passage of time or change in actuarial assumption could reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of mpra application in the future it is reasonably possible that at the next measurement date the projected benefit obligation could increase by approximately billion resulting in total obligation for the cspf coordinating benefit of billion the company also developed disclosure of the risk and uncertainty associated with this matter the assumption require significant management judgment and the following audit consideration auditing management conclusion that the cspf benefit to the ups transfer group can not be reduced without first exhausting benefit reduction to the other cspf participant is challenging because there appears to be multiple legal interpretation of the benefit reduction provision of mpra and those provision have not yet been litigated auditing management conclusion that the cspf could not reduce benefit to the ups transfer group without the company consent requires judgment because the agreement between cspf and the company requiring such consent wa made before the passage of mpra and ha not yet been litigated auditing management assumption related to the timing and effective date of mpra application is subjective auditing the actuarial assumption used to estimate the timing and present value of future cspf cash flow is challenging because the underlying data is limited to information made publicly available by the cspf auditing the sufficiency of the company disclosure of this matter in the footnote to the financial statement is challenging due to the number of uncertainty associated with the potential obligation the critical audit matter wa addressed in the auditour audit procedure to address the company assumption used to measure it potential obligation to pay for cspf coordinating benefit to the ups transfer group the coordinating benefit included the following among others we tested the effectiveness of control over coordinating benefit assumption including those over the determination of the accounting model the key legal position relevant to determining it coordinating benefit obligation the other actuarial assumption used to project the potential coordinating benefit obligation and the related financial statement disclosure with the assistance of professional in our firm expertise in pension accounting we evaluated the company conclusion regarding the accounting model applied to the coordinating benefit obligation through consideration of possible alternative under gaap we evaluated the company assumption used in determining the most likely outcome of the cspf matter under the existing legislative framework in order to evaluate the company expectation that the trustee would pursue another benefit suspension in order to avoid insolvency we obtained evidence regarding the fiduciary responsibility of the trustee to govern the cspf in manner that continues to provide benefit to participant and their beneficiary we evaluated the company conclusion that the cspf could not reduce benefit to the ups transfer group under mpra without first exhausting benefit reduction to the other cspf participant and the cspf could not reduce benefit without obtaining the company consent based on the term of an agreement between the cspf and the company specifically we examined letter from internal and external counsel describing both counsel conclusion that those position are more likely than not to be sustained if they were to be litigated with the assistance of professional in our firm having expertise in legal matter we also evaluated whether the legal argument supporting this assertion had substantive legal basis with the assistance of our actuarial specialist we tested the underlying data and actuarial model used by management to estimate the potential obligation to provide coordinating benefit including consideration of the expected timing of cspf benefit reduction the discount rate the projected contribution and benefit payment and the expected return on cspf asset further because the data used by management is limited to publicly available cspf information we considered whether other available source of data may yield more precise estimate we compared the company footnote disclosure relating to this matter to the information communicated between management and the company audit committee to evaluate whether significant uncertainty had been omitted from the disclosure valuation of hedge fund risk parity private debt private equity and real estate investment refer to note

used by management to estimate the nav of the plan hedge fund risk parity private debt private equity and real estate investment included the following among others we tested the effectiveness of control including those related to the reliability of value reported by fund manager the relevance of asset class benchmark return and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable input related to the underlying asset of the fund for certain investment we confirmed directly with the respective fund manager it preliminary estimate of the fund nav of december we evaluated the company ability to

on it undiscounted future cash flow if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal appropriate we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified leased assetsfor discussion of our accounting policy related to leased asset refer to note parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsgoodwill and intangible assetscosts of purchased business in excess of net identifiable asset acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually unless change in circumstance indicate an impairment may have occurred sooner we are required to test goodwill on reporting unit basis reporting unit is the operating segment unless for business within that operating segment discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management in which case such component business is the reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we consider several factor including macroeconomic condition industry and market condition overall financial performance of the reporting unit change in management strategy or customer and relevant reporting unit specific event such change in the carrying amount of net asset more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing of all or portion of reporting unit and the testing for recoverability of significant asset group within reporting unit if this qualitative assessment result in conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds the carrying value then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it calculated fair value then the second step is performed and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company appropriate trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are considered to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method to estimate the fair value of the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds it fair value finite lived intangible asset including trademark license patent customer list non compete agreement and franchise right are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset which range from to year capitalized software is generally amortized over year self insurance accrualswe self insure cost associated with worker compensation claim automobile liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well estimate of claim that have been incurred but not yet reported the expected ultimate cost for claim incurred is estimated based upon historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected level of cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of our reserve worker compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in healthcare cost the result of any related litigation and with respect to worker compensation claim change in legislation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from actuarial projection all of these factor can result in revision to actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result based on our historical experience during we changed our self insurance reserve from the central estimate to the low end of the actuarial range of loss the principal result of this change wa decrease in expense of million and an increase in net income of million or per share on basic and diluted basis we believe our estimated reserve for such claim are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimate and affect our result of operation we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee these liability and related expense are based on estimate of the number of employee and eligible dependent covered

increase rate mortality rate and coordination of benefit with plan not sponsored by ups actuarial assumption are reviewed on an annual basis unless circumstance require an interim remeasurement of any of our plan we recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and net actuarial gain or loss in excess of corridor defined of the greater of the fair value of plan asset or the plan projected benefit obligation in net periodic benefit cost other than service cost annually at december each year the remaining component of pension expense primarily service and interest cost and the expected return on plan asset are recorded on quarterly basis for eligible employee hired after july ups contributes annually to defined contribution plan we recognize expense for the required contribution quarterly and we recognize liability for any contribution due and unpaid included in other current liability during june we amended the ups retirement plan and excess coordinating plan to cease accrual of additional benefit for future service for non union participant effective january we remeasured plan asset and pension benefit obligation for the affected pension plan of june to recognize the impact of this change we participate in number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plan for employee covered under collective bargaining agreement our contribution to these plan are determined in accordance with the respective collective bargaining agreement we recognize expense for the contractually required contribution for each period and we recognize liability for any contribution due and unpaid within other current liability income taxesincome tax are accounted for on an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statement or tax return in estimating future tax consequence we generally consider all expected future event other than proposed change in the tax law or rate valuation allowance are provided if it is more likely than not that deferred tax asset will not be realized we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any once it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from position filed or to be filed with the tax authority is recorded liability for uncertain tax benefit it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in january the financial accounting standard board fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low

flow from acquired customer acquired technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may

service whether carried out or arranged by ups either domestically or internationally which generally occurs over short period of time additionally we provide value added logistics service to customer both domestically and internationally through our global network of company owned and leased distribution center and field stocking location disaggregation of revenue year ended december next day air domestic package domestic package forwarding chain freight consolidated revenue account for contract when both party have approved the contract and are committed to perform their obligation the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable performance obligationsa performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with gaap to determine the proper revenue recognition method for contract we evaluate whether two or more contract should be combined and accounted for single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for more than one performance obligation this evaluation requires judgment and the decision to combine group of contract or to separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligation could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period within most of our contract the customer contract with to provide distinct service such transportation service the vast majority of our contract with customer for transportation service include only one performance obligation the transportation service themselves however if contract is separated into more than one performance obligation we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the promised good or service underlying each performance obligation we frequently sell standard transportation service with observable standalone sale price in these instance the observable standalone sale are used to determine the standalone selling price parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsin certain business unit such logistics we sell customized customer specific solution in which we provide significant service of integrating complex set of task and component into single capability even if that single capability result in the delivery of multiple unit hence the entire contract is accounted for one performance obligation in these case we typically use the expected cost plus margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation satisfaction of performance obligationswe generally recognize revenue over time we perform the service in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer our customer receive the benefit of our service the good are transported from one location to another further if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed control transfer over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the product or service to be provided we use the cost to cost measure of progress for our package delivery contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs we incur cost on our contract under the cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost at completion of the performance obligation revenue including ancillary or accessorial fee and reduction for estimated customer incentive are recorded proportionally cost are incurred cost to fulfill include labor and other direct cost and an allocation of indirect cost for our freight and freight forwarding contract an output method of progress based on time in transit is utilized the timing of cost incurred doe not best depict the transfer of control to the customer in our logistics business we have right to consideration from customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date and such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have right to invoice the customer variable considerationit is common for our contract to contain customer incentive guaranteed service refund or other provision that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these variable amount are generally dependent upon achievement of certain incentive tier or performance metric we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount of revenue which may be reduced by incentive or other contract provision in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amount in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to contract modificationscontracts are often modified to account for change in the rate we charge our customer or to add additional distinct service we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new or change the existing enforceable right and obligation contract modification that add additional distinct good or service are treated separate contract contract modification that do not add distinct good or service typically change the price of existing service these contract modification are accounted for prospectively the remaining performance obligation are distinct payment termsunder the typical payment term of our customer contract the customer pay at periodic interval every day day day etc for shipment included on invoice received invoice are generated each week on the week ending day which is saturday for the majority of our domestic package business but could be another day depending on the business unit or the specific agreement with the customer it is not customary business practice to extend payment term past day and such we do not have practice of including significant financing component within our contract with customer parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsprincipal agent considerationsin our transportation business we utilize independent contractor and third party carrier in the performance of some transportation service gaap requires to evaluate using control model whether our business themselves promise to transfer service to the customer the principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party the agent based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that all of our major business act the principal rather than the agent within their revenue arrangement revenue and the associated purchased transportation cost are both reported on gross basis within our statement of consolidated income account receivable netaccounts receivable net include amount billed and currently due from customer the amount due are stated at their net estimated realizable value loss on account receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires to make our best estimate of the probable loss inherent in

transaction contract liability consist of advance payment and billing in excess of revenue well deferred revenue advance payment and billing in excess of revenue represent payment received from our customer that will be earned over the contract term deferred revenue represents the amount of consideration due from customer related to in transit shipment that ha not yet been recognized revenue based on our selected measure of progress we classify advance payment and billing in excess of revenue either current or long term depending on the period over which the advance payment will be earned we classify deferred revenue current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue which typically occurs within short window after period end the full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction our contract asset and liability are reported in net position on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period

effective january we remeasured plan asset and pension benefit obligation for the affected pension plan of june resulting in net actuarial gain of million this reflected curtailment gain of billion

rate is used to determine the present value of our future benefit obligation to determine the discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plan we use bond matching approach to select

october we refined our bond matching approach by implementing advance in technology and modeling technique this refinement decreased the projected benefit obligation on our consolidated balance sheet for our pension and postretirement plan by approximately million of december additionally we estimate that this refinement in method decreased our pre tax mark to market charge by approximately million and increased net income by million or per share on basic and diluted basis for our international plan the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flow of sample plan of similar duration to yield curve based on long term high quality fixed income debt instrument available of the measurement date these assumption are updated each measurement date which is typically

determine component of net periodic benefit cost for the year the assumption for our plan is developed using long term projection of return for each asset class our asset allocation target are reviewed and if necessary updated taking into consideration plan change funded status and actual performance the expected return for each asset class is function of passive long term capital market

consistent with the term of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf under our withdrawal agreement with the cspf benefit to the ups transfer group can not be reduced without our consent and can only be reduced in accordance with applicable law in december congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra this change in law for the first time permitted multiemployer pension plan to reduce benefit payment to retiree subject to specific guideline in the statute and government approval in september the cspf submitted proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the department of the treasury treasury in may treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf in the first quarter of congress established joint select committee to develop recommendation to improve the solvency of multiemployer plan and the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc before november deadline while the committee effort failed to meet it deadline the committee made significant progress towards finding solution that will address the long term solvency of multiemployer pension plan in the third quarter of the house of representative passed the rehabilitation for multiemployer pension act of to provide assistance to critical and declining multiemployer pension plan this bill is now with the senate for consideration ups will continue to work with all stakeholder including legislator and regulator to implement an acceptable solution the cspf ha said that it belief legislative solution to it funded status is necessary or that it will become insolvent in and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore option to avoid insolvency numerous factor could affect the cspf funded status and ups potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit under the ups ibt plan any obligation to pay coordinating benefit will be subject to number of significant uncertainty including whether the cspf submits revised mpra filing and the term thereof or whether it otherwise seek federal government assistance well the term of any applicable legislation the extent to which benefit are paid by the pbgc and our ability to successfully defend legal position we may take in the future under the mpra including the suspension ordering provision our withdrawal agreement and other applicable law we account for the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit to the ups transfer group under accounting standard codification topic compensation retirement benefit asc which requires to provide best estimate of various actuarial assumption including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december measurement date while we currently believe the most likely outcome to this matter and the broader systemic problem facing multiemployer pension plan is intervention by the federal government asc doe not permit anticipation of change in law in making best estimate of pension liability such our best estimate of the next most likely outcome at the december measurement date is that the cspf will submit and implement another benefit reduction plan under the mpra during we believe any mpra filing would be designed to forestall insolvency by reducing benefit to participant other than the ups transfer group to the maximum extent permitted and then reducing benefit to the ups transfer group by lesser amount we evaluated this outcome using deterministic cash flow projection reflecting updated estimated cspf cash flow and investment earnings the lack of legislative action and the absence of mpra filing by the cspf in result at the december measurement date the best estimate of our projected benefit obligation for coordinating benefit that may be required to be directly provided by the ups ibt plan to the ups transfer group is billion parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsthe future value of this estimate will be influenced by the term and timing of any mpra filing change in our discount rate rate of return on asset and other actuarial assumption presumed solvency of the pbgc well potential solution resulting from federal government intervention any such event may result in decrease or an increase in the best estimate of our projected benefit obligation if the uncertainty are not resolved it is reasonably possible that our projected benefit obligation could increase by approximately billion resulting in total obligation for coordinating benefit of approximately billion if future change in law occurs it may be significant event requiring an interim remeasurement
