direct financing operatingloansfinanced service contractschannels financing arrangementsend user financing of contentsacquisitions investment and alliancesthe market in which we compete require wide variety of technology product and capability our growth strategy is based on the component of innovation which we sometimes refer to build buy partner invest and co develop this five prong approach to we innovate can be summarized follows buildworking within cisco with the developer community or with customersbuyacquiring or divesting depending on goalspartnerstrategically partnering to further build the businessinvestmaking investment in area where technology is in it infancy or where there is no dominant technologyco developdeveloping new solution with multi party team that may include customer channel partner startup independent software vendor and academicsacquisitionswe have acquired many company and we expect to make future acquisition merger and acquisition of high technology company are inherently risky especially if the acquired company ha yet to generate revenue no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisition will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our financial condition or operating result prior acquisition have resulted in wide range of outcome from successful introduction of new product and technology to an inability to do the risk associated with acquisition are more fully discussed in item risk factor including the risk factor entitled we have made and expect to continue to make acquisition that could disrupt our operation and harm our operating result investment in privately held companieswe make investment in privately held company that develop technology or provide service that are complementary to our product or that provide strategic value the risk associated with these investment are more fully discussed in item risk factor including the risk factor entitled we are exposed to fluctuation in the market value of our portfolio investment and in interest rate impairment of our investment could harm our earnings strategic allianceswe pursue strategic alliance with other company in area where collaboration can produce industry advancement and acceleration of new market the objective and goal of strategic alliance can include one or more of the following technology exchange product development joint sale and marketing or new market creation company with which we have added or expanded strategic alliance during fiscal and in recent year include apple google microsoft and amazon web service among others company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and in our view this trend may increase the risk associated with our strategic alliance are more fully discussed in item risk factor including the risk factor entitled if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliance we may not realize the expected benefit from such alliance and we may experience increased competition or delay in product development competitionwe compete in the networking and communication equipment market providing product and service designed to transport and help secure data voice and video traffic across cloud private and public network and the internet these market are characterized by rapid change converging technology and migration to networking and communication solution that offer relative advantage these market factor represent both an opportunity and competitive threat to we compete with numerous vendor in each product category the overall number of our competitor providing niche product solution may increase also the identity and composition of competitor may change we increase our activity in our new product market we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic region in particular we have experienced price focused competition from competitor in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue our competitor in each case relative to only some of our product or service include amazon web service llc arista network inc broadcom inc commscope holding company inc check point software technology ltd dell technology inc dynatrace network inc fireeye inc fortinet inc hewlett packard enterprise company huawei technology co ltd juniper network inc lenovo group limited logmein inc microsoft corporation new relic inc nokia corporation nutanix inc palo alto network inc ringcentral inc slack technology inc ubiquiti network vmware inc zoom video communication inc and zscaler inc among others of contentssome of these company compete across many of our product line while others are primarily focused in specific product area barrier to entry are relatively low and new venture to create product that do or could compete with our product are regularly formed in addition some of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do we expand into new market we will face competition not only from our existing competitor but also from other competitor including existing company with strong technological marketing and sale position in those market we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributor of our product company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technology including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated within the data center due to several factor including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessor application specific integrated circuit asics offering advanced service standard based protocol cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technology within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segment also some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center result of all of these development we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technology including competition from entity that are among our long term strategic alliance partner company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with the principal competitive factor in the market in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcome the ability to provide broad range of networking and communication product and service product performance price the ability to introduce new product including providing continuous new customer value and product with price performance advantage the ability to reduce production cost the ability to provide value added feature such security reliability and investment protection conformance to standard market presence the ability to provide financing disruptive technology shift and new business model we also face competition from customer to which we license or supply technology and supplier from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability therefore we must cooperate and at the time compete with many company any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationship with customer supplier and strategic alliance partner could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition and accordingly affect our chance of success research and developmentwe regularly introduce new product and feature to address the requirement of our market we allocate our research and development budget among our product category which consist of infrastructure platform application security and other product technology our research and development expenditure are applied generally to all product area with specific area of focus being identified from time to time recent area of increased focus include our intent based networking technology which encompasses switching routing and wireless technology within infrastructure platform conferencing security and analytics product our expenditure for research and development cost were expensed incurred the industry in which we compete is subject to rapid technological development evolving standard change in customer requirement and new product introduction and enhancement result our success depends in part upon our ability on cost effective and timely basis to continue to enhance our existing product and to develop and introduce new product that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership to achieve these objective our management and engineering personnel work with customer to identify and respond to customer need well with other innovator of internet working product including university laboratory and corporation we also expect to continue to make acquisition and investment where appropriate to provide with access to new technology nonetheless there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully of contentsdevelop product to address new customer requirement and technological change or that those product will achieve market acceptance

risk factorsset forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other document we file with the sec are description of the risk and uncertainty that could cause our actual result to differ materially from the result contemplated by the forward looking statement contained in this report our business result of operation and financial condition have been adversely affected and could in the future be materially adversely affected by the covid pandemicthe covid pandemic and the resulting containment measure have caused economic and financial disruption globally including in most of the region in which we sell our product and service and conduct our business operation in the second half of fiscal the covid pandemic had an impact on our financial result and business operation with significant impact in the third quarter of fiscal on our supply chain where we saw manufacturing challenge and component constraint the magnitude and duration of the disruption it continuing impact on and resulting decline in global business activity is uncertain these disruption include the unprecedented action taken to try to contain the pandemic such travel ban and restriction business closure and social distancing measure such quarantine and shelter in place order the covid pandemic and the responsive measure taken in many country have adversely affected and could in the future materially adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition shelter in place order and other measure including work from home and other policy implemented to protect worker ha and could in the future impact our supply chain vendor may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customer for business regulatory or political reason and or demand change in agreed pricing condition of supply such disruption may continue or worsen in the future in addition current and future restriction or disruption of transportation such reduced availability of air transport port closure and increased border control or closure can also impact our ability to meet customer demand and could materially adversely affect our customer have also experienced and may continue to experience disruption in their operation which can result in delayed reduced or canceled order and increased collection risk and which may adversely affect our result of operation the covid pandemic may also result in long term change in customer need for our product and service in various sector along with it of contentsrelated capital spending reduction or shift in spending focus that could materially adversely affect if we are unable to adjust our product and service offering to match customer need the recent shift to remote working environment also creates challenge for example governmental lockdown restriction or new regulation ha and could in the future impact the ability of our employee and vendor to work with the same speed and productivity in certain area even other area do not see negative impact the extent and or duration of ongoing workforce restriction and limitation could impact our ability to enhance develop and support existing product and service and hold product sale and marketing event to the extent we were able to previously in addition malefactor are seeking to use the covid pandemic to launch new cyber attack see the risk factor below entitled cyber attack data breach or malware may disrupt our operation harm our operating result and financial condition and damage our reputation and cyber attack or data breach on our customer network or in cloud based service provided by or enabled by could result in claim of liability against damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business and vulnerability and critical security defect prioritization decision regarding remedying vulnerability or security defect failure of third party provider to remedy vulnerability or security defect or customer not deploying security release or deciding not to upgrade product service or solution could result in claim of liability against damage our reputation or otherwise harm our business the covid pandemic ha also led to increased disruption and volatility in capital market and credit market the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resource in the future the input into certain of our judgment assumption and estimate considered the economic implication of the covid pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimate the actual result that we experience may differ materially from our estimate the covid pandemic continues to develop many of our estimate could require increased judgment and carry higher degree of variability and volatility event continue to evolve our estimate may change materially in future period we are continuing to monitor the pandemic and take appropriate action in accordance with the recommendation and requirement of relevant authority the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our operational and financial performance is currently uncertain and will depend on many factor outside our control including without limitation the timing extent trajectory and duration of the pandemic the development and availability of effective treatment and vaccine the imposition of protective public safety measure and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy potential negative impact of these external factor include but are not limited to material adverse effect on demand for our product and service our supply chain and sale and distribution channel collectability of customer account our ability to execute strategic plan impairment and our profitability and cost structure to the extent the covid pandemic adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risk discussed in this risk factor section our operating result may fluctuate in future period which may adversely affect our stock price our operating result have been in the past and will continue to be subject to quarterly and annual fluctuation result of numerous factor some of which may contribute to more pronounced fluctuation in an uncertain global economic environment these factor include fluctuation in demand for our product and service especially with respect to service provider and internet business in part due to change in the global economic environment change in sale and implementation cycle for our product and reduced visibility into our customer spending plan and associated revenue our ability to maintain appropriate inventory level and purchase commitment price and product competition in the communication and networking industry which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business model from various geographic region the overall movement toward industry consolidation among both our competitor and our customer the introduction and market acceptance of new technology and product and our success in new and evolving market and in emerging technology well the adoption of new standard the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offering where revenue is recognized over time variation in sale channel product cost mix of product sold or mix of direct sale and indirect of content the timing size and mix of order from customer manufacturing and customer lead time fluctuation in our gross margin and the factor that contribute to such fluctuation described below the ability of our customer channel partner contract manufacturer and supplier to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditure especially during period of global credit market disruption or in the event of customer channel partner contract manufacturer or supplier financial problem actual event circumstance outcome and amount differing from judgment assumption and estimate used in determining the value of certain asset including the amount of related valuation allowance liability and other item reflected in our consolidated financial statement how well we execute on our strategy and operating plan and the impact of change in our business model that could result in significant restructuring charge our ability to achieve targeted cost reduction benefit anticipated from our investment in engineering sale service and marketing change in tax law or accounting rule or interpretation thereofas consequence operating result for particular future period are difficult to predict and therefore prior result are not necessarily indicative of result to be expected in future period any of the foregoing factor or any other factor discussed elsewhere herein could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition that could adversely affect our stock price our operating result may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market condition and the uncertain geopolitical environment challenging economic condition worldwide have from time to time contributed and may continue to contribute to slowdown in the communication and networking industry at large well in specific segment and market in which we operate resulting in reduced demand for our product result of continued constraint on it related capital spending by our customer particularly service provider and other customer market well increased price competition for our product not only from our competitor but also consequence of customer disposing of unutilized product risk of excess and obsolete inventory risk of supply constraint risk of excess facility and manufacturing capacity higher overhead cost percentage of revenue and higher interest expensethe global macroeconomic environment continues to be challenging and inconsistent and is being significantly impacted by the covid pandemic during fiscal we continued to see more broad based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise market we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging country and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these market additionally instability in the global credit market the impact of uncertainty regarding global central bank monetary policy the instability in the geopolitical environment in many part of the world including result of the united kingdom brexit withdrawal from the european union the current economic challenge in china including global economic ramification of chinese economic difficulty and other disruption may continue to put pressure on global economic condition if global economic and market condition or economic condition in key market remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impact on our business operating result and financial condition of contentsour operating result in one or more segment may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic condition particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer market within that segment for example emerging country in the aggregate experienced decline in product order in fiscal and in certain prior period in addition report of certain intelligence gathering method of the government could affect customer perception of the product of it company which design and manufacture product in the united state trust and confidence in an it supplier is critical to the development and growth of our market impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory action taken in response to report of certain intelligence gathering method of the government could affect the demand for our product from customer outside of the united state and could have an adverse effect on our operating result we have been investing and expect to continue to invest in key priority and growth area well maintaining leadership in infrastructure platform and in service and if the return on these investment is lower or develops more slowly than we expect our operating result may be harmed we expect to realign and dedicate resource into key priority and growth area such security and application while also focusing on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platform and in service however the return on our investment may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefit anticipated from these investment including if our selection of area for investment doe not play out we expect or if the achievement of these benefit is delayed our operating result may be adversely affected our revenue for particular period is difficult to predict and shortfall in revenue may harm our operating result result of variety of factor discussed in this report our revenue for particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment the significant impact of the covid pandemic and related market uncertainty during fiscal we continued to see more broad based weakening in the global macroeconomic environment which impacted our commercial and enterprise market we also experienced continuing weakness in the service provider market and emerging country and we expect ongoing uncertainty in these market our revenue may grow at slower rate than in past period or decline it during fiscal and in certain prior period on year over year basis our ability to meet financial expectation could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sale pattern seen in some of our past quarter recurs in future period we have experienced period of time during which shipment have exceeded net booking or manufacturing issue have delayed shipment leading to nonlinearity in shipping pattern in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for particular period nonlinearity in shipping can increase cost because irregular shipment pattern result in period of underutilized capacity and period in which overtime expense may be incurred well in potential additional inventory management related cost in addition to the extent that manufacturing issue and any related component shortage result in delayed shipment in the future and particularly in period in which our contract manufacturer are operating at higher level of capacity it is possible that revenue for quarter could be adversely affected if such matter occur and are not remediated within the same quarter the timing of large order can also have significant effect on our business and operating result from quarter to quarter primarily in the united state and in emerging country from time to time we receive large order that have significant effect on our operating result in the period in which the order is recognized revenue the timing of such order is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such order may affect period to period change in revenue result our operating result could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such order and their ultimate recognition revenue inventory management remains an area of focus we have experienced longer than normal manufacturing lead time in the past which have caused some customer to place the same order multiple time within our various sale channel and to cancel the duplicative order upon receipt of the product or to place order with other vendor with shorter manufacturing lead time such multiple ordering along with other factor or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue and result could impair our ability to manage part inventory effectively in addition our effort to improve manufacturing lead time performance may result in more variability and le predictability in our revenue and operating result in addition when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation which in turn contribute to an increase in purchase commitment increase in our purchase commitment to shorten lead time could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charge if the demand for our product is le than our expectation we plan our operating expense level based primarily on forecasted revenue level these expense and the impact of long term commitment are relatively fixed in the short term shortfall in revenue could lead to operating result being below expectation because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expense in response to short term business change any of the factor could have material adverse impact on our operation and financial result of contentswe expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable although our product gross margin increased in fiscal our level of product gross margin declined in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have declined in certain prior period on year over year basis and could decline in future period due to adverse impact from various factor including change in customer geographic or product mix including mix of configuration within each product group introduction of new product including product with price performance advantage and new business model including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offering our ability to reduce production cost entry into new market or growth in lower margin market including market with different pricing and cost structure through acquisition or internal development sale discount increase in material labor or other manufacturing related cost which could be significant especially during period of supply constraint such those impacting the market for memory component excess inventory and inventory holding charge obsolescence charge change in shipment volume the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferral increased cost including those caused by tariff loss of cost saving or dilution of saving due to change in component pricing or charge incurred due to inventory holding period if part ordering doe not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturer or supplier deteriorates lower than expected benefit from value engineering increased price competition including competitor from asia especially from china change in distribution channel increased warranty cost increased amortization of purchased intangible asset especially from acquisition how well we execute on our strategy and operating planschanges in service gross margin may result from various factor such change in the mix between technical support service and advanced service well the timing of technical support service contract initiation and renewal and the addition of personnel and other resource to support higher level of service business in future period sale to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in order from this industry may harm our operating result and financial condition sale to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchase especially relating to our router sale and sale of certain other infrastructure platform and application product in addition to longer sale cycle service provider product order decreased during fiscal and in certain prior period and at various time in the past including in recent quarter we have experienced significant weakness in product order from service provider product order from the service provider market could continue to decline and ha been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended period of time given fluctuating market condition sale activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructure the availability of funding and the extent to which service provider are affected by regulatory economic of contentsand business condition in the country of operation weakness in order from this industry including result of any slowdown in capital expenditure by service provider which may be more prevalent during global economic downturn or period of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition such slowdown may continue or recur in future period order from this industry could decline for many reason other than the competitiveness of our product and service within their respective market for example in the past many of our service provider customer have been materially and adversely affected by slowdown in the general economy by overcapacity by change in the service provider market by regulatory development and by constraint on capital availability resulting in business failure and substantial reduction in spending and expansion plan these condition have materially harmed our business and operating result in the past and some of these or other condition in the service provider market could affect our business and operating result in any future period finally service provider customer typically have longer implementation cycle require broader range of service including design service demand that vendor take on larger share of risk often require acceptance provision which can lead to delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendor all these factor can add further risk to business conducted with service provider disruption of or change in our distribution model could harm our sale and margin if we fail to manage distribution of our product and service properly or if our distributor financial condition or operation weaken our revenue and gross margin could be adversely affected substantial portion of our product and service is sold through our channel partner and the remainder is sold through direct sale our channel partner include system integrator service provider other resellers and distributor system integrator and service provider typically sell directly to end user and often provide system installation technical support professional service and other support service in addition to network equipment sale system integrator also typically integrate our product into an overall solution and number of service provider are also system integrator distributor stock inventory and typically sell to system integrator service provider and other resellers we refer to sale through distributor our two tier system of sale to the end customer these distributor are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program if sale through indirect channel increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product and to degree the timing of order from our customer historically we have seen fluctuation in our gross margin based on change in the balance of our distribution channel although variability to date ha not been significant there can be no assurance that change in the balance of our distribution model in future period would not have an adverse effect on our gross margin and profitability some factor could result in disruption of or change in our distribution model which could harm our sale and margin including the following we compete with some of our channel partner including through our direct sale which may lead these channel partner to use other supplier that do not directly sell their own product or otherwise compete with them some of our channel partner may demand that we absorb greater share of the risk that their customer may ask them to bear some of our channel partner may have insufficient financial resource and may not be able to withstand change and challenge in business condition revenue from indirect sale could suffer if our distributor financial condition or operation weakenin addition we depend on our channel partner globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirement to the extent that they fail to do so that could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition further sale of our product outside of agreed territory can result in disruption to our distribution channel the market in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth the market in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technology and migration to networking and communication solution that offer relative advantage these market factor represent competitive threat to we compete with numerous vendor in each product category the overall number of our competitor providing niche product solution may increase also the identity and composition of competitor may change we increase our activity in newer product area and in key priority and growth area for example product related to network programmability such software defined networking sdn product become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from company that develop networking product based on commoditized hardware referred to white box hardware to the extent customer decide to purchase those product of contentsofferings instead of in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered service enables new competitor to enter the market we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic region in particular we have experienced price focused competition from competitor in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitor see the section entitled competition contained in item business of this report some of our competitor compete across many of our product line while others are primarily focused in specific product area barrier to entry are relatively low and new venture to create product that do or could compete with our product are regularly formed in addition some of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do we expand into new market we will face competition not only from our existing competitor but also from other competitor including existing company with strong technological marketing and sale position in those market we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributor of our product company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and in our view this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technology including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factor including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessor asics offering advanced service standard based protocol cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technology within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segment also some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center result of all of these development we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technology including competition from entity that are among our long term strategic alliance partner company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with the principal competitive factor in the market in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcome the ability to provide broad range of networking and communication product and service product performance price the ability to introduce new product including providing continuous new customer value and product with price performance advantage the ability to reduce production cost the ability to provide value added feature such security reliability and investment protection conformance to standard market presence the ability to provide financing disruptive technology shift and new business modelswe also face competition from customer to which we license or supply technology and supplier from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many company any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationship with customer supplier and strategic alliance partner could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition and accordingly affect our chance of success of contentsinventory management relating to our sale to our two tier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margin we must manage inventory relating to sale to our distributor effectively because inventory held by them could affect our result of operation our distributor may increase order during period of product shortage cancel order if their inventory is high or delay order in anticipation of new product they also may adjust their order in response to the supply of our product and the product of our competitor that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuation in end user demand our distributor are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program inventory management remains an area of focus we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory level to ensure competitive lead time against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our price and write inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margin supply chain issue including financial problem of contract manufacturer or component supplier or shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increased our cost or caused delay in our ability to fulfill order could have an adverse impact on our business and operating result and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margin the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facility and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our product and on our business and operating result any financial problem of either contract manufacturer or component supplier could either limit supply or increase cost reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturer by other company inside or outside of our industry could either limit supply or increase cost industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier market such the semiconductor market could either limit supply or increase costsa reduction or interruption in supply including disruption on our global supply chain result of the covid pandemic significant increase in the price of one or more component failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturer failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirement based on our business need or decrease in demand for our product could materially adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationship furthermore result of binding price or purchase commitment with supplier we may be obligated to purchase component at price that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase component at price in excess of the current market price when the component are actually used our gross margin could decrease we have experienced longer than normal lead time in the past although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation action when significant disruption have occurred if similar situation occur in the future they could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition see the risk factor above entitled our revenue for particular period is difficult to predict and shortfall in revenue may harm our operating result our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in part on our ability to obtain timely delivery of part from our supplier and contract manufacturer we have experienced component shortage in the past including shortage caused by manufacturing process issue that have affected our operation we may in the future experience shortage of certain component part result of our own manufacturing issue manufacturing issue at our supplier or contract manufacturer capacity problem experienced by our supplier or contract manufacturer including capacity or cost problem resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand in the industry for those part growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressure on and our supplier to accurately project overall component demand and component demand within specific product category and to establish optimal component level and manufacturing capacity especially for labor intensive component component for which we purchase substantial portion of the supply or the ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex product during period of shortage or delay the price of component may increase or the component may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortage if we do not accurately anticipate our need we may not be able to secure enough component at reasonable price or of acceptable quality to build new product in timely manner in the quantity or configuration needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer until other source can be developed our operating result would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more component than we need which is more likely to occur in period of demand uncertainty such we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance of contentsthat we will not encounter these problem in the future although in many case we use standard part and component for our product certain component are presently available only from single source or limited source and global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of component from one or more of these source especially during time such we have recently seen when there are supplier constraint based on labor and other action taken during economic downturn we may not be able to diversify source in timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver product to customer and seriously impact present and future sale we believe that we may be faced with the following challenge in the future new market in which we participate may grow quickly which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity we acquire company and new technology we may be dependent at least initially on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply partner we face competition for certain component that are supply constrained from existing competitor and company in other marketsmanufacturing capacity and component supply constraint could continue to be significant issue for we purchase component from variety of supplier and use several contract manufacturer to provide manufacturing service for our product during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing lead time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreement with contract manufacturer and supplier that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criterion defined by or that establish the parameter defining our requirement in certain instance these agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation which in turn contributes to an increase in purchase commitment increase in our purchase commitment to shorten lead time could also lead to excess and obsolete inventory charge if the demand for our product is le than our expectation if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of part could result in excess or obsolete component that could adversely affect our gross margin for additional information regarding our purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier see note to the consolidated financial statement we depend upon the development of new product and service and enhancement to existing product and service and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trend and customer changing need our operating result and market share may suffer the market for our product and service are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard new product and service introduction and evolving method of building and operating network our operating result depend on our ability to develop and introduce new product and service into existing and emerging market and to reduce the production cost of existing product if customer do not purchase and or renew our offering our business could be harmed the covid pandemic may also result in long term change in customer need for our product and service in various sector along with it related capital spending reduction or shift in spending focus that could materially adversely affect if we are unable to adjust our product and service offering to match customer need the process of developing new technology including intent based networking more programmable flexible and virtual network and technology related to other market transition such security digital transformation and iot and cloud is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customer changing need and emerging technological trend our business could be harmed we must commit significant resource including the investment we have been making in our strategic priority to developing new product and service before knowing whether our investment will result in product and service the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking doe not emerge we believe it will or if the industry doe not evolve we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiative and investment may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce product related to network programmability such software defined networking product in timely fashion or if product offering in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such for example networking product based on white box hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in timely fashion offering to address other transition or if the offering addressing these other transition that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in period surrounding our new product introduction if customer delay purchasing decision to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offering of contentswe have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual product and service to selling product and service integrated into architecture and solution and we are seeking to meet the evolving need of customer which include offering our product and solution in the manner in which customer wish to consume them part of this transformation we continue to make change to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including change in our business model with customer if our strategy for addressing our customer need or the architecture and solution we develop do not meet those need or the change we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenge with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdle that we fail to overcome in timely fashion or lack of appropriate resource this could result in competitor some of which may also be our strategic alliance partner providing those solution before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered service enables new competitor to enter the market the success of new product and service depends on several factor including proper new product and service definition component cost timely completion and introduction of these product and service differentiation of new product and service from those of our competitor and market acceptance of these product and service there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunity develop and bring new product and service to market in timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our product and service or that product service and technology developed by others will not render our product service or technology obsolete or noncompetitive the product and technology in our other product category and key priority and growth area may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new product and service change in industry structure and market condition could lead to charge related to discontinuance of certain of our product or business asset impairment and workforce reduction or restructuringsin response to change in industry and market condition we may be required to strategically realign our resource and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting business any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit business may result in the recording of special charge such inventory and technology related write offs workforce reduction or restructuring cost charge relating to consolidation of excess facility or claim from third party who were resellers or user of discontinued product our estimate with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of asset including purchased intangible asset could change result of such assessment and decision although in certain instance our supply agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed our loss contingency may include liability for contract that we can not cancel with contract manufacturer and supplier further our estimate relating to the liability for excess facility are affected by change in real estate market condition additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and between annual test in certain circumstance and future goodwill impairment test may result in charge to earnings we initiated restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal which includes voluntary early retirement program the implementation of this restructuring plan may be disruptive to our business and following completion of the restructuring plan our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activity including any related charge and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sale service and marketing activity and these investment may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefit which could harm our operating result while we intend to focus on managing our cost and expense over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resource related to our engineering sale service and marketing function we realign and dedicate resource on key priority and growth area such security and application and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in infrastructure platform and in service we are likely to recognize the cost associated with these investment earlier than some of the anticipated benefit and the return on these investment may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefit anticipated from these investment or if the achievement of these benefit is delayed our operating result may be adversely affected of contentsour business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the internet and internet based system substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on growth and evolution of the internet including the continued development of the internet and the anticipated market transition and on the deployment of our product by customer who depend on such continued growth and evolution to the extent that an economic slowdown or uncertainty and related reduction in capital spending adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure including spending or investment related to anticipated market transition we could experience material harm to our business operating result and financial condition because of the rapid introduction of new product and changing customer requirement related to matter such cost effectiveness and security we believe that there could be performance problem with internet communication in the future which could receive high degree of publicity and visibility because we are large supplier of networking product our business operating result and financial condition may be materially adversely affected regardless of whether or not these problem are due to the performance of our own product such an event could also result in material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock independent of direct effect on our business we have made and expect to continue to make acquisition that could disrupt our operation and harm our operating result our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing product and our ability to introduce new product on timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new product and enhance existing product through acquisition of other company product line technology and personnel acquisition involve numerous risk including the following difficulty in integrating the operation system technology product and personnel of the acquired company particularly company with large and widespread operation and or complex product diversion of management attention from normal daily operation of the business and the challenge of managing larger and more widespread operation resulting from acquisition potential difficulty in completing project associated with in process research and development intangible difficulty in entering market in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitor in such market have stronger market position initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply partner insufficient revenue to offset increased expense associated with acquisition the potential loss of key employee customer distributor vendor and other business partner of the company we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plansacquisitions may also cause to issue common stock that would dilute our current shareholder percentage ownership use substantial portion of our cash resource or incur debt significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition assume liability record goodwill and intangible asset that are subject to impairment testing on regular basis and potential periodic impairment charge incur amortization expense related to certain intangible asset incur tax expense related to the effect of acquisition on our legal structure incur large write offs and restructuring and other related of content become subject to intellectual property or other litigationmergers and acquisition of high technology company are inherently risky and subject to many factor outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisition will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating result or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisition could materially harm our business and operating result prior acquisition have resulted in wide range of outcome from successful introduction of new product and technology to failure to do so even when an acquired company ha already developed and marketed product there can be no assurance that product enhancement will be made in timely fashion or that pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issue that might arise with respect to such product in addition our effective tax rate for future period is uncertain and could be impacted by merger and acquisition risk related to new product development also apply to acquisition see the risk factor above including the risk factor entitled we depend upon the development of new product and service and enhancement to existing product and service and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trend and customer changing need our operating result and market share may suffer for additional information entrance into new or developing market expose to additional competition and will likely increase demand on our service and support operation we focus on new market opportunity and key priority and growth area we will increasingly compete with large telecommunication equipment supplier well startup company several of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do additionally customer in these market complete infrastructure deployment they may require greater level of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging country demand for these type of service support or financing contract may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide product service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunity further entry into other market ha subjected and will subject to additional risk particularly to those market including the effect of general market condition and reduced consumer confidence for example we add direct selling capability globally to meet changing customer demand we will face increased legal and regulatory requirement industry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating result there ha been trend toward industry consolidation in our market for several year we expect this trend to continue company attempt to strengthen or hold their market position in an evolving industry and company are acquired or are unable to continue operation for example some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them with the ability to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitor that are better able to compete sole source vendor for customer this could lead to more variability in our operating result and could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customer with the effect that loss of major customer could have material impact on result not anticipated in customer marketplace composed of more numerous participant product quality problem could lead to reduced revenue gross margin and net income we produce highly complex product that incorporate leading edge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bug that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operation there can be no assurance that our pre shipment testing program will be adequate to detect all defect either one in individual product or one that could affect numerous shipment which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sale opportunity or affect gross margin from time to time we have had to replace certain component and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defect or bug in product that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have material impact an inability to cure product defect could result in the failure of product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from product or market damage to our reputation inventory cost or product reengineering expense any of which could have material impact on our revenue margin and net income for example in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded charge to product cost of sale of million related to the expected remediation cost for anticipated failure in future period of widely used component sourced from third party which is included in several of our product and in the second quarter of fiscal we recorded pre tax charge of million related to the expected remediation cost for certain product sold in prior fiscal year containing memory component manufactured by single supplier between and of contentsdue to the global nature of our operation political or economic change or other factor in specific country or region could harm our operating result and financial conditionwe conduct significant sale and customer support operation in country around the world such our growth depends in part on our increasing sale into emerging country we also depend on non operation of our contract manufacturer component supplier and distribution partner our business in emerging country in the aggregate experienced decline in order in fiscal and in certain prior period we continue to ass the sustainability of any improvement in our business in these country and there can be no assurance that our investment in these country will be successful our future result could be materially adversely affected by variety of political economic or other factor relating to our operation inside and outside the united state including impact from global central bank monetary policy issue related to the political relationship between the united state and other country that can affect regulatory matter affect the willingness of customer in those country to purchase product from company headquartered in the united state or affect our ability to procure component if government body were to deny access to those component government related disruption or shutdown and the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment any or all of which could have material adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition including among others the following foreign currency exchange rate political or social unrest economic instability or weakness or natural disaster in specific country or region including the current economic challenge in china and global economic ramification of chinese economic difficulty instability result of brexit environmental protection measure trade protection measure such tariff and other legal and regulatory requirement some of which may affect our ability to import our product to export our product from or sell our product in various country or affect our ability to procure component political consideration that affect service provider and government spending pattern health or similar issue including pandemic or epidemic such the covid pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decision difficulty in staffing and managing international operation adverse tax consequence including imposition of withholding or other tax on our global operationswe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customer and to credit exposure in weakened market which could result in material loss most of our sale are on an open credit basis with typical payment term of day in the united state and because of local custom or condition longer in some market outside the united state we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangement seek to limit such open credit to amount we believe the customer can pay and maintain reserve we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful account beyond our open credit arrangement we have also experienced demand for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangement we believe customer financing is competitive factor in obtaining business particularly in serving customer involved in significant infrastructure project our loan financing arrangement may include not only financing the acquisition of our product and service but also providing additional fund for other cost associated with network installation and integration of our product and service our exposure to the credit risk relating to our financing activity described above may increase if our customer are adversely affected by global economic downturn or period of economic uncertainty although we have program in place that are designed to monitor and mitigate the associated risk including monitoring of particular risk in certain geographic area there can be no assurance that such program will be effective in reducing our credit risk in the past there have been significant bankruptcy among customer both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangement particularly among internet business and service provider causing to incur economic or financial loss there can be no assurance that additional loss will not be incurred although these loss have not been material to date future loss if incurred could harm our business and have material adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition portion of our sale is derived through our distributor these distributor are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program we maintain estimated accrual and allowance for such business term however distributor tend to have more limited financial of contentsresources than other resellers and end user customer and therefore represent potential source of increased credit risk because they may be more likely to lack the reserve resource to meet payment obligation additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit market make it more difficult for some customer to obtain financing those customer ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition we are exposed to fluctuation in the market value of our portfolio investment and in interest rate impairment of our investment could harm our earnings we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity our portfolio includes available for sale debt investment and equity investment the value of which are subject to market price volatility if such investment suffer market price decline we experienced with some of our investment in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investment below their cost basis our non marketable equity and other investment are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investment are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product they have under development are typically in the early stage and may never materialize we could lose our entire investment in these company for information regarding the market risk associated with the fair value of portfolio investment and interest rate refer to the section titled quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate that could negatively impact our financial result and cash flow because significant portion of our business is conducted outside the united state we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate these exposure may change over time business practice evolve and they could have material adverse impact on our financial result and cash flow historically our primary exposure have related to nondollar denominated sale in japan canada and australia and certain nondollar denominated operating expense and service cost of sale in europe latin america and asia where we sell primarily in dollar additionally we have exposure to emerging market currency which can have extreme currency volatility an increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the united state where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expense and procurement of raw material to the extent that we must purchase component in foreign currency we enter into foreign exchange forward contract and option to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuation on certain foreign currency receivables investment and payable in addition we periodically hedge anticipated foreign currency cash flow our attempt to hedge against these risk may result in an adverse impact on our net income our proprietary right may prove difficult to enforce we generally rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law to establish and maintain proprietary right in our technology and product although we have been issued numerous patent and other patent application are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patent or other proprietary right will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our right will in fact provide competitive advantage to furthermore many key aspect of networking technology are governed by industrywide standard which are usable by all market entrant in addition there can be no assurance that patent will be issued from pending application or that claim allowed on any patent will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the law of some foreign country may not protect our proprietary right to the same extent do the law of the united state the outcome of any action taken in these foreign country may be different than if such action were determined under the law of the united state although we are not dependent on any individual patent or group of patent for particular segment of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary right to the totality of the feature including aspect of product protected other than by patent right in market we may find at competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative product that have enabled to be successful we may be found to infringe on intellectual property right of others third party including customer have in the past and may in the future assert claim or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property right to technology and related standard that are relevant to these assertion have increased over time result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertion particularly in the united state because of the existence of large number of patent in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patent and the rapid rate of issuance of new patent it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether product or any of it component infringes or will infringe on the patent right of others the asserted claim and or initiated litigation can include claim against or our manufacturer supplier or customer alleging infringement of their proprietary right with respect to our existing or future product or component of those product regardless of the merit of these claim they can be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require to develop non infringing technology or enter into license agreement where claim are made by customer resistance of contentseven to unmeritorious claim could damage customer relationship there can be no assurance that license will be available on acceptable term and condition if at all or that our indemnification by our supplier will be adequate to cover our cost if claim were brought directly against or our customer furthermore because of the potential for high court award that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claim settled for significant amount if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify customer with respect to claim against the customer or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary right on commercially reasonable term and condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligation see note to the consolidated financial statement contained in this report our exposure to risk associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased result of acquisition we have lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risk further in the past third party have made infringement and similar claim after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition we rely on the availability of third party license many of our product are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third party it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew license relating to various aspect of these product there can be no assurance that the necessary license would be available on acceptable term if at all the inability to obtain certain license or other right or to obtain such license or right on favorable term or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matter could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our product of software or other intellectual property licensed from third party on nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary right in our product our operating result may be adversely affected and damage to our reputation may occur due to production and sale of counterfeit version of our productsas is the case with leading product around the world our product are subject to effort by third party to produce counterfeit version of our product while we work diligently with law enforcement authority in various country to block the manufacture of counterfeit good and to interdict their sale and to detect counterfeit product in customer network and have succeeded in prosecuting counterfeiter and their distributor resulting in fine imprisonment and restitution to there can be no guarantee that such effort will succeed while counterfeiter often aim their sale at customer who might not have otherwise purchased our product due to lack of verifiability of origin and service such counterfeit sale to the extent they replace otherwise legitimate sale could adversely affect our operating result our operating result and future prospect could be materially harmed by uncertainty of regulation of the internet currently few law or regulation apply directly to access or commerce on the internet we could be materially adversely affected by regulation of the internet and internet commerce in any country where we operate such regulation could include matter such voice over the internet or using ip encryption technology sale or other tax on internet product or service sale and access charge for internet service provider the adoption of regulation of the internet and internet commerce could decrease demand for our product and at the same time increase the cost of selling our product which could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition change in telecommunication regulation and tariff could harm our prospect and future sale change in telecommunication requirement or regulatory requirement in other industry in which we operate in the united state or other country could affect the sale of our product in particular we believe that there may be future change in telecommunication regulation that could slow the expansion of the service provider network infrastructure and materially adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition including net neutrality rule to the extent they impact decision on investment in network infrastructure future change in tariff by regulatory agency or application of tariff requirement to currently untariffed service could affect the sale of our product for certain class of customer additionally in the united state our product must comply with various requirement and regulation of the federal communication commission and other regulatory authority in country outside of the united state our product must meet various requirement of local telecommunication and other industry authority change in tariff or failure by to obtain timely approval of product could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition of contentsfailure to retain and recruit key personnel would harm our ability to meet key objective our success ha always depended in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical managerial sale and marketing personnel competition for these personnel is intense especially in the silicon valley area of northern california stock incentive plan are designed to reward employee for their long term contribution and provide incentive for them to remain with volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or equity incentive award or change to our overall compensation program including our stock incentive program resulting from the management of share dilution and share based compensation expense or otherwise may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employee result of one or more of these factor we may increase our hiring in geographic area outside the united state which could subject to additional geopolitical and exchange rate risk the loss of service of any of our key personnel the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future or delay in hiring required personnel particularly engineering and sale personnel could make it difficult to meet key objective such timely and effective product introduction in addition company in our industry whose employee accept position with competitor frequently claim that competitor have engaged in improper hiring practice we have received these claim in the past and may receive additional claim to this effect in the future adverse resolution of litigation or governmental investigation may harm our operating result or financial condition we are party to lawsuit in the normal course of our business litigation can be expensive lengthy and disruptive to normal business operation moreover the result of complex legal proceeding are difficult to predict for example brazilian authority have investigated our brazilian subsidiary and certain of it former employee well brazilian importer of our product and it affiliate and employee relating to alleged evasion of import tax and alleged improper transaction involving the subsidiary and the importer brazilian tax authority have assessed claim against our brazilian subsidiary based on theory of joint liability with the brazilian importer for import tax interest and penalty the asserted claim by brazilian federal tax authority which remain are for calendar year through and the asserted claim by the tax authority from the state of sao paulo are for calendar year through the total remaining asserted claim by brazilian state and federal tax authority aggregate to million for the alleged evasion of import and other tax million for interest and million for various penalty all determined using an exchange rate of july we have completed thorough review of the matter and believe the asserted claim against our brazilian subsidiary are without merit and we are defending the claim vigorously while we believe there is no legal basis for the alleged liability due to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding the judicial process in brazil and the nature of the claim asserting joint liability with the importer we are unable to determine the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome against our brazilian subsidiary and are unable to reasonably estimate range of loss if any we do not expect final judicial determination for several year an unfavorable resolution of lawsuit or governmental investigation could have material adverse effect on our business operating result or financial condition for additional information regarding certain of the matter in which we are involved see note to the consolidated financial statement subsection legal proceeding change in our provision for income tax or adverse outcome resulting from examination of our income tax return could adversely affect our result our provision for income tax is subject to volatility and could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in country that have lower tax rate and higher than anticipated in

significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income tax the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd an international association comprised of country including the united state ha made change to numerous long standing tax principle there can be no assurance that these change once adopted by country will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income tax further result of certain of our ongoing employment and capital investment action and commitment our income in certain country wa subject to reduced tax rate our failure to meet these commitment could adversely impact our provision for income tax in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service and other tax authority we regularly ass the likelihood of adverse outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax there can be no assurance that the outcome from these continuous examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition of contentsour business and operation are especially subject to the risk of earthquake flood and other natural catastrophic event our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operation are located in the silicon valley area of northern california region known for seismic activity additionally certain number of our facility are located near river that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our supplier and logistics center are located in region that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity which in the past ha disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of component and delivery of product significant natural disaster such an earthquake hurricane volcano or flood could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and

result in industry growth however alliance carry an element of risk because in most case we must compete in some business area with company with which we have strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business area also if these company fail to perform or if these relationship fail to materialize expected we could suffer delay in product development or other operational difficulty joint venture can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interest of joint venture partner our stock price may be volatile historically our common stock ha

policy described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimate such accounting policy require significant judgment assumption and estimate used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement and actual result could differ materially from the amount reported based on these policy the input into certain of our judgment assumption and estimate considered the economic implication of the covid pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimate the covid pandemic did not have material impact on our significant judgment assumption and estimate that are reflected in our result for fiscal these estimate include goodwill and identified purchased intangible asset and income tax among other item the actual result that we experience may differ materially from our estimate the covid pandemic continues to develop many of our estimate could require increased judgment and carry higher degree of variability and volatility event continue to evolve our estimate may change materially in future period revenue recognition we enter into contract with customer that can include various combination of product and service which are generally distinct and accounted for separate performance obligation result our contract may contain multiple performance obligation we determine whether arrangement are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on it own or together with other resource that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligation in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software license and saas distinct performance obligation term software license represent multiple obligation which include software license and software maintenance in transaction where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and cost of good sold on gross basis we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised good or service in contract with customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product or service transfer of control occurs once the customer ha the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss ha transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and service the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software license are distinct performance obligation where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software license include multiple performance obligation where the term license are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term service and software update are provided saas arrangement do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term the customer consumes the service on our product sale we record consideration from shipping and handling on gross basis within net product sale we record our revenue net of any associated sale tax revenue is allocated among these performance obligation in manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised good or service based on standalone selling price ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of product or service when we sell the good separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer in instance where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we apply judgment in determining the transaction price we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalty and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive program that we offer to our distributor channel partner and customer when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these program applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customer right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable if actual credit received by distributor under these program were to deviate significantly from our estimate which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detail of contentsloss contingencieswe are subject to the possibility of various loss arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of impairment of an asset or the incurrence of liability well our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingency an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset ha been impaired or liability ha been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated we regularly evaluate information available to to determine whether such accrual should be made or adjusted and whether new accrual are required third party including customer have in the past and may in the future assert claim or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property right to technology and related standard that are relevant to these assertion have increased over time result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertion particularly in the united state if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against by any third party is successful or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary right on commercially reasonable term and condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairmentsour methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisition is determined through established valuation technique goodwill represents residual value of the acquisition date which in most case result in measuring goodwill an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net asset acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment test on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual test in certain circumstance for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible asset is based on factor that market participant would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial asset in response to change in industry and market condition we could be required to strategically realign our resource and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting business which could result in an impairment of goodwill there wa no impairment of goodwill in fiscal and for the annual impairment testing in fiscal the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting unit wa billion for the america billion for emea and billion for apjc during the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting unit and determined that hypothetical decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit the fair value of acquired technology and patent well acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discount expected future cash flow to present value the discount rate used in the present value calculation are typically derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis and adjusted to reflect risk inherent in the development lifecycle appropriate we consider the pricing model for product related to these acquisition to be standard within the high technology communication industry and the applicable discount rate represent the rate that market participant would use for valuation of such intangible asset we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased intangible asset with finite life whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible asset with finite life is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate we review indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our purchased intangible asset are complex and subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast our ongoing consideration of all the factor described previously could result in impairment charge in the future which could adversely affect our net income income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction our effective tax rate differ

different than the amount recorded such difference will impact the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made the provision for income tax includes the impact of reserve provision and change to reserve that are considered appropriate well the related net interest and penalty significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax asset in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider all available evidence including past operating result estimate of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategy in the event that we change our determination to the amount of deferred tax asset that can be realized we will adjust our valuation allowance with corresponding impact to the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made our provision for income tax is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower than anticipated in country that have lower tax rate and higher than anticipated in country that have higher tax rate by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability by change to

manufacturer which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment cost our lease have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lessee we determine if an arrangement is lease at commencement our rou lease asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment related to the lease operating lease rou asset and liability are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term we use incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of our lease payment certain of our lease agreement contain variable lease payment our variable lease payment can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain service where we have elected to combine lease and non lease component while these payment are not included part of our lease liability they are recognized variable lease expense in the period they are incurred we provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third party product primarily through our channel partner and distributor for which the income arising from these lease is recognized through interest income lessor we determine if an arrangement is lease at inception we provide leasing arrangement for our equipment to certain qualified customer our lease portfolio primarily consists of sale type lease we allocate the consideration in bundled contract with our customer based on relative standalone selling price of our lease and non lease component the residual value on our leased equipment is determined at the inception of the lease based on an analysis of estimate of the value of equipment market factor and historical customer behavior residual value estimate are reviewed on periodic basis and other than temporary decline are expensed in the period they occur our lease generally provide an end of term option for the customer to extend the lease under mutually agreed term return the leased equipment or purchase the equipment for either the then market value of the equipment or pre determined purchase price if customer chooses to terminate their lease prior to the original end of term date the customer is required to pay all remaining lease payment in full

purchase consideration of our acquisition to the tangible asset liability and intangible asset acquired including in process research and development ipr based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill ipr is initially capitalized at fair value an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when an ipr project is completed the ipr is reclassified an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset estimated useful life acquisition related expense and related restructuring cost are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed incurred of content goodwill and purchased intangible asset goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and when specific circumstance dictate between annual test when impaired the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value identifying potential impairment consists of comparing the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount including goodwill purchased intangible asset with finite life are carried at cost le accumulated amortization amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the respective asset see long lived asset for our policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible asset with finite life purchased intangible asset with indefinite life are assessed for potential impairment annually or when event or circumstance indicate that their carrying amount might be impaired long lived asset long lived asset that are held and used by are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of long lived asset is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flow resulting from the use of the asset and it eventual disposition measurement of an impairment loss for long lived asset that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying value long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value le cost to sell fair value fair value is defined the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we also consider assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability the accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value the standard establishes fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the input used to measure fair value financial instrument categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy is follows level applies to asset or liability for which there are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level applies to asset or liability for which there are input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability such quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical asset or liability in market with insufficient volume or infrequent transaction le active market or model derived valuation in which significant input are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data we use input such actual trade data benchmark yield broker dealer quote and other similar data which are obtained from quoted market price independent pricing vendor or other source to determine the ultimate fair value of asset or liability level applies to asset or liability for which there are unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability the fair value are determined based on model based technique such discounted cash flow model using input that we could not corroborate with market data derivative instrument we recognize derivative instrument either asset or liability and measure those instrument at fair value the accounting for change in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of aoci and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affect earnings the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately for derivative instrument designated net investment hedge of our foreign operation the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within aoci together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operation any ineffective portion of the net investment hedge is reported in earnings during the period of change for derivative instrument that are not designated accounting hedge change in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change we record derivative instrument in the statement of cash flow to operating investing or financing activity consistent with the cash flow of the hedged item hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contract used cash flow hedge is assessed by comparing the change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flow of the hedged item hedge effectiveness for equity forward contract and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contract is assessed by comparing change in fair value due to change in spot rate for both the derivative and the hedged item for foreign exchange option contract hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument entire change in fair value hedge effectiveness for interest rate swap is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to change in the benchmark interest rate of content foreign currency translation asset and liability of non subsidiary that operate in local currency environment where that local currency is the functional currency are translated to dollar at exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date with the resulting translation adjustment directly recorded to separate component of aoci income and expense account are translated at average exchange rate during the year remeasurement adjustment are recorded in other income loss net the effect of foreign currency exchange rate on cash and cash equivalent wa not material for any of the fiscal year presented concentration of risk cash and cash equivalent are maintained with several financial institution deposit held with bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposit generally these deposit may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institution with reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk we seek to mitigate our credit risk by spreading such risk across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties we perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customer and with the exception of certain financing transaction do not require collateral from our customer we receive certain of our component from sole supplier additionally we rely on limited number of contract manufacturer and supplier to provide manufacturing service for our product the inability of contract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirement could materially impact future operating result revenue recognition we enter into contract with customer that can include various combination of product and service which are generally distinct and accounted for separate performance obligation result our contract may contain multiple performance obligation we determine whether arrangement are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on it own or together with other resource that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligation in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software license and saas distinct performance obligation term software license represent multiple obligation which include software license and software maintenance in transaction where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and cost of good sold on gross basis we refer to our term software license security software license saas and associated service arrangement subscription offer we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised good or service in contract with customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product or service transfer of control occurs once the customer ha the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment or once title and risk of loss ha transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and service the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software license are distinct performance obligation where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software license include multiple performance obligation where the term license are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term service and software update are provided saas arrangement do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term the customer consumes the service on our product sale we record consideration from shipping and handling on gross basis within net product sale we record our revenue net of any associated sale tax an allowance for future sale return is established based on historical trend in product return rate the allowance for future sale return of july and july wa million and million respectively and wa recorded reduction of our account receivable and revenue significant judgment revenue is allocated among these performance obligation in manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised good or service based on standalone selling price ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of product or service when we sell the good separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer in instance where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we apply judgment in determining the transaction price we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalty and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive program that we offer to our distributor channel partner and customer when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these program applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customer right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable we ass certain software license such for security software that contain critical update or upgrade which customer can download throughout the contract term without these update or upgrade the functionality of the software would diminish over relatively short time period these update or upgrade provide the customer the full functionality of the purchased security software license and are required to maintain the security license utility the risk and threat in the environment are rapidly of contentschanging in these circumstance the revenue from these software arrangement is recognized single performance obligation satisfied over the contract term we adopted asc at the beginning of fiscal using the modified retrospective method to those contract that were not completed of july for the additional information see note advertising cost we expense all advertising cost incurred advertising cost included within sale and marketing expense were approximately million million and million for fiscal and respectively share based compensation expense we measure and recognize the compensation expense for all share based award made to employee and director including employee stock option restricted stock unit rsus performance based restricted stock unit prsus and employee stock purchase related to the employee stock purchase plan employee stock purchase right based on estimated fair value the fair value of employee stock option is estimated on the date of grant using lattice binomial option pricing model lattice binomial model or the black scholes model and for employee stock purchase right we estimate the fair value using the black scholes model the fair value for time based stock award and stock award that are contingent upon the achievement of financial performance metric is based on the grant date share price reduced by the present value of the expected dividend yield prior to vesting the fair value of market based stock award is estimated using an option pricing model on the date of grant share based compensation expense is reduced for forfeiture software development cost software development cost including cost to develop software sold leased or otherwise marketed that are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized if significant cost incurred during the application development stage for internal use software are capitalized if significant capitalized software development cost are amortized using the straight line amortization method over the estimated useful life of the applicable software such software development cost required to be capitalized have not been material to date income tax income tax expense is based on pretax financial accounting income deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected tax consequence of temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized we account for uncertainty in income tax using two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement we classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefit current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position are recognized in the provision for income tax computation of net income per share basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share and dilutive potential common share outstanding during the period diluted share outstanding includes the dilutive effect of in the money option unvested restricted stock and restricted stock unit the dilutive effect of such equity award is calculated based on the average share price for each fiscal period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the amount the employee must pay for exercising stock option and the amount of compensation cost for future service that we have not yet recognized are collectively assumed to be used to repurchase share consolidation of variable interest entity our approach in assessing the consolidation requirement for variable interest entity focus on identifying which enterprise ha the power to direct the activity that most significantly impact the variable interest entity economic performance and which enterprise ha the obligation to absorb loss or the right to receive benefit from the variable interest entity should we conclude that we are the primary beneficiary of variable interest entity the asset liability and result of operation of the variable interest entity will be included in our consolidated financial statement of content use of estimate the preparation of financial statement and related disclosure in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make estimate and judgment that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note estimate are used for the following among others revenue recognition allowance for account receivable sale return and financing receivables inventory valuation and liability for purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier loss contingency and product warranty fair value measurement and other than temporary impairment goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment income taxesthe input into certain of our judgment assumption and estimate considered the economic implication of the covid pandemic on our critical and significant accounting estimate the actual result experienced by may differ materially from our estimate the covid pandemic continues to develop many of our estimate could require increased judgment and carry higher degree of variability and volatility event continue to evolve our estimate may change materially in future period new accounting update recently adoptedleases in february the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard codification asc lease new standard requiring lessee to recognize operating and finance lease liability on the balance sheet well corresponding right of use rou asset this standard also made some change to lessor accounting and aligns key aspect of the lessor accounting model with the revenue recognition standard we adopted this standard at the beginning of fiscal and applied it at the beginning of the period of adoption and did not restate prior period in connection with the adoption of asc we recognized billion of operating lease rou asset which wa included in other asset and billion of operating lease liability which wa included in other current liability and other long term liability there were no transition adjustment recorded from the adoption of asc lessor we elected to apply the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance within asc which doe not require reassessment of initial direct cost classification of lease and definition of lease we also elected additional practical expedient which resulted in allowing not to reassess the accounting treatment for existing or expired land easement in transition ii combining lease and non lease component and iii not recording lease with an initial term of le than month on our consolidated balance sheet recent accounting standard or update not yet effective of fiscal year end credit loss of financial instrument in june the fasb issued an accounting standard update that requires measurement and recognition of expected credit loss for financial asset held based on historical experience current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new standard replaces the incurred loss impairment model under this standard we will be required to use forward looking expected credit loss model for account receivable financing receivables contract asset and other financial instrument credit loss relating to available for sale debt security will also be recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security we will adopt this standard at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on modified retrospective basis with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded an adjustment to retained earnings this standard will not have material impact
