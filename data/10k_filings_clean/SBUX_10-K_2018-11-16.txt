and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operation we purchase green coffee bean from multiple coffee producing region around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standard for our many blend and single origin coffee the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility although most coffee trade in the commodity market high altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by starbucks tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium the coffee commodity price both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase supply and price can be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including weather natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition price is also impacted by trading activity in the arabica coffee future market including hedge fund and commodity index fund in addition green coffee price have been affected in the past and may be affected in the future by the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply we buy coffee using fixed price and price to be fixed purchase commitment depending on market condition to secure an adequate supply of

adopted new regulation that became effective in may called the general data protection regulation gdpr which requires company to meet new requirement regarding the handling of personal data including it use protection and transfer and the ability of person whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about failure to meet the gdpr requirement could result in penalty of up to of annual worldwide revenue the gdpr also confers private right of action on certain individual and association our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customer could also be adversely impacted if we fail or are perceived to have failed to properly respond to these incident such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability compliance with the gdpr and other applicable international and privacy cybersecurity and related law can be costly and time consuming significant capital investment and other expenditure could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problem and prevent future breach including cost associated with additional security technology personnel expert and credit monitoring service for those whose data ha been breached these cost which could be material could adversely impact our result of operation in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempt to breach our information technology system medium or other report of existing or perceived security vulnerability in our system or those of our third party business partner or service provider can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business even if no breach ha been attempted or ha occurred additionally the technique and sophistication used to conduct cyber attack and breach of information technology system well the source and target of these attack change frequently and are often not recognized until such attack are launched or have been in place for period of time we continue to make significant investment in technology third party service and personnel to develop and implement system and process that are designed to anticipate cyber attack and to prevent or minimize breach of our information technology system or data loss but these security measure can not provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breach or data loss of content we rely heavily on information technology in our operation and growth initiative and any material failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial result we rely heavily on information technology system across our operation including for administrative function point of sale processing and payment in our store and online management of our supply chain starbucks card online business delivery service mobile technology including mobile payment and ordering apps reloads and loyalty functionality and various other process and transaction and many of these system are interdependent on one another for their functionality additionally the success of several of our initiative to drive growth including our priority to increase digital relationship with our customer to drive incremental traffic and spend is highly dependent on our technology system our ability to effectively manage our business launch digital and other initiative and coordinate the production distribution administration and sale of our product depends significantly on the reliability integrity and capacity of these system we also rely on third party provider and platform for some of these information technology system and support additionally our system hardware software and service provided by third party service provider are not fully redundant within market or across our market although we have operational safeguard in place they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these system or platform to operate effectively and be available such failure may be caused by various factor including power outage catastrophic event physical theft computer and network failure inadequate or ineffective redundancy problem with transitioning to upgraded or replacement system or platform flaw in third party software or service error or improper use by our employee or third party service provider or breach in the security of these system or platform including through cyber attack such those that result in the blockage of our or our third party business partner or service provider system and platform and those discussed in more detail in this risk factor section if our incident response disaster recovery and business continuity plan do not resolve these issue in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operation and could cause material negative impact to our product availability and sale the efficiency of our operation and our financial result in addition remediation of any problem with our system could result in significant unplanned expense we may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiative or effectively managing growth which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial result there is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiative in accordance with our expectation or that they will generate expected return which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial result these strategic initiative are designed to create growth improve our result of operation and drive long term shareholder value and include being an employer of choice and investing in employee to deliver superior customer experience building our leadership position around coffee driving convenience brand engagement and digital relationship through our mobile loyalty delivery and digital capability both domestically and internationally simplifying store administrative task to allow store partner to better engage with customer increasing the scale of the starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store format moving to more licensed store model in some market and more company owned model in other market creating new occasion in store across all dayparts with new product offering including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup continuing the global growth of our channel development business through our supply distribution and licensing agreement with nestlé and other channel development business partner delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business including our tea business through the teavana brand in our starbucks retail store and other channel and internationally and reducing our general and administrative cost in addition to other factor listed in this risk factor section factor that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiative which could have material adverse impact on our business and financial result include the following increase in labor cost including wage and benefit which in retail business such are two of our most significant cost both domestically and internationally these increase include significant and sudden increase in labor cost triggered by regulatory action regarding wage and scheduling and benefit requirement they also include increased health care and worker compensation insurance cost well increased wage and cost of other of contentsbenefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employee with the right skill set whether due to changing industry practice competition or our expansion into new channel or technology dependent operation not successfully developing and implementing new technology necessary to effectuate our growth strategy including increasing our digital relationship with customer to drive growth due to inability to attract and retain qualified high tech personnel or other factor increasing competition in channel in which we operate or seek to operate from new and existing large competitor or well funded smaller one that sell high quality specialty coffee beverage continuing disruption in retail caused by on line commerce resulting in reduced foot traffic to brick mortar retail store consumer shifting category of where they spend their discretionary income away from outside the home food and beverage imposition of additional tax by jurisdiction such on certain type of beverage or based on number of employee construction cost increase associated with new store opening and remodeling of existing store delay in store opening for reason beyond our control or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate either of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target in the and internationally not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure our product offering increase and we continue to expand including our emphasis on broad range of high quality food offering the ability of our licensee partner to implement our growth platform and product innovation lack of customer acceptance of new product including due to price increase necessary to cover the cost of new product or higher input cost brand such the global expansion of the teavana brand in our starbucks retail store and other channel and platform such feature of our mobile technology change in our loyalty reward program and our delivery service initiative or customer reducing their demand for our current offering new product are introduced the degree to which we enter into maintain develop and are able to negotiate appropriate term and condition of and enforce commercial and other agreement and the performance of our business partner under such agreement not successfully consummating and implementing favorable strategic transaction or integrating acquired business including our east china business the effect of the tax cut and job act and related guidance and regulation that may be promulgated and the deterioration in our credit rating which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiative our channel development business is heavily reliant on nestlé which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged good and foodservice product to retailer and operator with exception if nestlé fails to perform it distribution and marketing commitment under our agreement and or fails to support protect and grow our brand in channel development our channel development business could be adversely impacted for period of time present long term challenge to our brand limit our ability to grow our channel development business and have material adverse impact on our business and financial result additionally our channel development business is also in part dependent on the level of support our retail business partner provide our product and in some market there are only few retailer if our retail business partner do not provide sufficient level of support for our product which is at their discretion it could limit our ability to grow our channel development business also relatively small number of licensee partner own large number of licensed store if such licensee partner are not able to access sufficient fund or financing or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their business including their licensed store it could have material adverse effect on our result in the market in which they operate their licensed store effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly we continue to expand into new channel outside the retail store model implement our arrangement with nestlé for most of our global channel development business and grow our teavana brand in our starbucks retail store and other channel well expand into new market internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goal philosophy and standard growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure consistent supply of high quality raw material to locate and hire sufficient number of key employee to maintain an effective system of internal control for globally dispersed enterprise and to train employee worldwide to deliver consistently high quality product and customer of contentsexperience furthermore if we are not successful in implementing these strategic initiative such large acquisition and integration we may be required to evaluate whether certain asset including goodwill and other intangible have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have material impact on our financial result we face intense competition in each of our channel and market which could lead to reduced profitability the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience such delivery service and mobile ordering and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these area in each of our channel and market accordingly we do not have leadership position in all channel and market in the the ongoing focus by large competitor in the quick service restaurant sector on selling high quality specialty coffee beverage could lead to decrease in customer traffic to starbucks store and or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sale and result of operation similarly continued competition from well established competitor or competition from large new entrant or well funded smaller company in our domestic and international market could hinder growth and adversely affect our sale and result of operation in those market many small competitor also continue to open coffee specialty store in many of our market across the world which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decrease of customer traffic to our store in those market increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single serve and ready to drink coffee beverage market including from new and large entrant to this market could adversely affect the profitability of the channel development segment furthermore decline in general consumer demand for specialty coffee product for any reason including due to consumer preference for other product or flattening demand for our product could have negative effect on our business we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our america operating segment our financial performance is highly dependent on our america operating segment it comprised approximately of consolidated total net revenue in fiscal if the america operating segment revenue trend slow or decline especially in our and canada market our other segment may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial result could be adversely affected and because the america segment is relatively mature and produce the large majority of our operating cash flow such slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flow for funding the expansion of our international business and other initiative and for returning cash to shareholder we are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international market in order to achieve our growth target our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international market some or all of our international market business unit mbus which we generally define by the country in which they operate may not be successful in their operation or in achieving expected growth which ultimately requires achieving consistent stable net revenue and earnings the performance of these international operation may be adversely affected by economic downturn in one or more of the country in which our large mbus operate decline in performance of one or more of our significant international mbus could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result the cap segment is one of our two significant profit center driving our global return along with our america segment in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and cap net revenue and earnings china is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall with our recent acquisition of the east china business the china market is now company owned and along with the market due to the significance of our china market for our profit and growth we are exposed to risk in china including the risk mentioned elsewhere below and the following the effect of current china relation including round of tariff increase and retaliation and increasing restrictive regulation potential boycott and increasing anti americanism entry of new competitor to the specialty coffee market in china change in economic condition in china and potential negative effect to the growth of it middle class wage labor inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain cost ongoing government regulatory reform including relating to food safety tariff and tax bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretation which may be contrary to ours well potential significant increase in compliance cost food safety related matter including compliance with food safety regulation and ability to ensure product quality and safety and the ability to successfully integrate the east china business additionally some factor that will be critical to the success of our international operation overall are different than those affecting our store and licensee taste naturally vary by region and consumer in some mbus may not embrace our product to the same extent consumer in the or other international market occupancy cost and store operating expense can be higher internationally than in the due to higher rent for prime store location or cost of compliance with of contentscountry specific regulatory requirement because many of our international operation are in an early phase of development operating expense percentage of related revenue are often higher compared to more developed operation such in the additionally our international joint venture partner or licensee may face capital constraint or other factor that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in certain market our international operation are also subject to additional inherent risk of conducting business abroad such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation or requirement to transact in specific currency change or uncertainty in economic legal regulatory social and political condition in our market well negative effect on business due to increasing anti american sentiment in certain market interpretation and application of law and regulation including tax tariff labor merchandise anti bribery and privacy law and regulation uncertainty and effect of the implementation of the united kingdom referendum to withdraw membership from the european union refer to brexit including financial legal tax and trade implication restrictive action of foreign or governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment especially during period of heightened tension the and such foreign governmental authority including protective measure such export and custom duty and tariff government intervention favoring local competitor and restriction on the level of foreign ownership import or other business licensing requirement the enforceability of intellectual property and contract right limitation on the repatriation of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction due to current or new and international regulation in developing economy the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient level of disposable income may not be fast we forecast difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental action affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural difference well challenge in recruiting and retaining high quality employee in local market local law that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employee delay in store opening for reason beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitor or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate any of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target and in turn negatively impact net revenue operating income and earnings per share and disruption in energy supply affecting our market moreover many of the foregoing risk are particularly acute in developing country which are important to our long term growth prospect increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity or decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity could have an adverse impact on our business and financial result we purchase roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee bean and related coffee product the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and ha and may increase significantly due to one or more of the factor described below the high quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium above the price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increase in the coffee commodity price do increase the price of high quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed price purchase commitment we frequently enter into supply contract whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated term are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base coffee commodity price component will be fixed ha not yet been established these are known price to be fixed contract the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factor in the producing country such weather including the potential effect of climate change natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition well the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply speculative trading in coffee commodity can also influence coffee price because of the significance of coffee bean to our operation combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practice and hedging activity increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean could have material of contentsadverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantity of green coffee due to any of the above factor or to worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have material adverse impact on our profitability we also purchase significant amount of dairy product particularly fluid milk to support the need of our company operated retail store additionally and although le significant to our operation than coffee or dairy other commodity including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage input such cocoa produce baking ingredient meat egg and energy well the processing of these input are important to our operation increase in the cost of dairy product and other commodity or lack of availability whether due to supply shortage delay or interruption in processing or otherwise especially in international market could have material adverse impact on our profitability our financial condition and result of operation are sensitive to and may be adversely affected by number of factor many of which are largely outside our control our operating result have been in the past and will continue to be subject to number of factor many of which are largely outside our control any one or more of the factor listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factor section could have material adverse impact our business financial condition and or result of operation increase in real estate cost in certain domestic and international market adverse outcome of litigation severe weather or other natural or man made disaster affecting large market or several closely located market that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such market and especially in our larger or fast growing market labor discord or disruption geopolitical event war terrorism including incident targeting political instability boycott increasing anti american sentiment in certain market social unrest and natural disaster including health pandemic that lead to avoidance of public place or restriction on public gathering such in our store interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our product and could negatively impact our business and profitability any material interruption in our supply chain such material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plant interruption in service by our third party logistic service provider or common carrier that ship good within our distribution channel trade restriction such increased tariff or quota embargo or custom restriction natural disaster or political dispute and military conflict that cause material disruption in our supply chain could have negative material impact on our business and our profitability additionally our food beverage and other product are sourced from wide variety of domestic and international business partner in our supply chain operation and in certain case are produced or sourced by our licensee directly we rely on these supplier to provide high quality product and to comply with applicable law our ability to find qualified supplier who meet our standard and supply product in timely and efficient manner is significant challenge especially with respect to good sourced from outside the especially country or region with diminished infrastructure developing or failing economy or experiencing political instability or social unrest and we increase our fresh and prepared food offering for certain product we may rely on one or few supplier supplier failure to meet our standard provide product in timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable law is beyond our control these issue especially for those product for which we rely on one or few supplier could have material negative impact on our business and profitability failure to meet market expectation for our financial performance and fluctuation in the stock market whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock failure to meet market expectation going forward particularly with respect to operating margin earnings per share comparable store sale operating cash flow shareholder return and net revenue will likely result in decline and or increased volatility in the market price of our stock in addition price and volume fluctuation in the stock market whole may affect the market price of our stock in way that may be unrelated to our financial performance the loss of key personnel or difficulty recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial result much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel the loss of any of our executive officer or other key senior management personnel could harm our business we must continue to recruit retain and motivate management and other employee sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiative some of which involve ongoing expansion in business channel outside of our traditional company operated store model our success also depends substantially on the contribution and ability of our retail store employee we rely on to give customer superior in store experience and elevate our brand accordingly our performance of contentsdepends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employee to work in and manage our store both domestically and internationally our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic market where the competition for relatively small number of qualified employee is intense or in market where large high tech company are able to offer more competitive salary and benefit well where there is strong economy with many available job and intense competition for the available workforce additionally there is intense competition for qualified technology system developer necessary to develop and implement new technology for our growth initiative including increasing our digital relationship with customer if we are

operating segment structure in support of the newly established global coffee alliance our reportable segment have been restated if those smaller business were previously within our channel development segment concurrent with the change in reportable operating segment we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment

performed sensitivity analysis based on basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale security of september and determined that such change would not have significant impact on the fair value of these instrument application of critical accounting policiescritical accounting policy are those that management belief are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption our significant accounting policy are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this we believe that of our significant accounting policy the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity we consider financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past five fiscal year we have not made any material change to the accounting methodology used to ass the area discussed below unless noted otherwise of contentsproperty plant and equipment and other finite lived assetswe evaluate property plant and equipment and other finite lived asset for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes it new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset remaining useful life long lived asset are grouped with other asset and liability at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of store asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model for other long lived asset fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant fact and circumstance which may include discounted cash flow comparable transaction or comparable company analysis our impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and asset fair value key assumption used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair value include projected revenue growth and operating expense well forecasting asset useful life and selecting an appropriate discount rate for company operated store estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection and consider the store historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store performance the discount rate is selected based on we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the store these estimate are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flow and asset fair value is affected by factor such ongoing maintenance and improvement of the asset change in economic condition and change in operating performance during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption aside from those related to the decision to close certain company operated store in the and canada which had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assetswe evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating these asset for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flow or combination of discounted cash flow and market approach when assessing goodwill for impairment our decision to perform qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in given year is influenced by number of factor inclusive of the size of the reporting unit goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting unit estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessment and the date of acquisition if we perform quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit goodwill our impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flow and asset fair value including projected revenue growth and operating expense related to existing business product innovation and new store concept well utilizing valuation multiple of similar publicly traded company and selecting an appropriate discount rate estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection considering the reporting unit past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiative local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region these estimate well the selection of comparable company and valuation multiple used in the market approach are highly subjective and our ability to realize the future cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such the success of strategic initiative change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy including retail initiative and international expansion when assessing indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment where we perform qualitative assessment we evaluate if change in event or circumstance have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist if we do not perform qualitative impairment assessment or if change in event and circumstance indicate that quantitative assessment should be performed management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group the fair value calculation includes estimate of revenue growth which are based on past performance and internal projection for the intangible asset group forecasted growth and royalty rate which are adjusted for our particular fact and circumstance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimate are highly subjective and our of contentsability to achieve the forecasted cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such the success of strategic initiative change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy including retail initiative and international expansion the goodwill impairment charge related to the switzerland reporting unit are discussed in note other intangible asset and goodwill to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax base of our asset and liability deferred tax asset and liability are measured using current enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax asset and may record valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax asset within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and result of operation in projecting future taxable income we consider historical result and incorporate assumption about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for item that do not have tax consequence our assumption regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plan and estimate we use to manage our underlying business in evaluating the objective evidence that historical result provide we consider three year of cumulative operating income loss in addition our income tax return are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authority these audit include review of our tax filing position including the timing and amount of deduction taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdiction we evaluate our exposure associated with our various tax filing position and recognize tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit of our position for uncertain tax position that do not meet this threshold we record related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitation expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available discussed in note income tax to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this there is reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within month due to the expiration of statute of limitation and or resolution of examination with taxing authority we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdiction that may be subject to additional income or withholding tax we have historically asserted our intent to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future the company continues to evaluate it plan for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus ha not adjusted it previous indefinite reinvestment assertion for the effect of the tax act while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the to satisfy domestic liquidity need if these amount were distributed to the in the form of dividend or otherwise we may be subject to additional income or withholding tax which could be material our income tax expense deferred tax asset and liability and liability for unrecognized tax benefit reflect management best assessment of estimated current and future tax to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our liability for unrecognized tax benefit require significant management judgment regarding applicable statute and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audit and our particular fact and circumstance although we believe that the judgment and estimate discussed herein are reasonable actual result could differ and we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material to the extent we prevail in matter for which liability ha been established or are required to pay amount in excess of our established liability our effective income tax

asset or pay to transfer liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participant for asset and liability recorded or disclosed at fair value on recurring basis we determine fair value based on the following level the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent approximates fair value because of the short term nature of these instrument for trading and government treasury security and commodity future contract we use quoted price in active market for identical asset to determine fair value level when quoted price in active market for identical asset are not available we determine the fair value of our available for sale security and our over the counter forward contract collar and swap based upon factor such the quoted market price of similar asset or discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data which may include of contentsinterest rate curve and forward and spot price for currency and commodity depending on the nature of the investment the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the quoted market price for the same or similar issue or on the current rate offered to for debt of the same remaining maturity level we determine the fair value of our auction rate security using an internally developed valuation model using input that include interest rate curve credit and liquidity spread and effective maturity asset and liability recognized or disclosed at fair value on nonrecurring basis may include item such property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible asset equity and cost method investment and other asset we determine the fair value of these item using level input described in the related section below derivative instrumentswe manage our exposure to various risk within our consolidated financial statement according to market price risk management policy under this policy we may engage in transaction involving various derivative instrument to hedge interest rate commodity price and foreign currency denominated revenue stream inventory purchase asset and liability and investment in certain foreign operation in order to manage our exposure to these risk we use various type of derivative instrument including forward contract commodity future contract collar and swap forward contract and commodity future contract are agreement to buy or sell quantity of currency or commodity at predetermined future date and at predetermined rate or price collar is strategy that us combination of purchased call option and sold put option with equal premium to hedge portion of anticipated cash flow or to limit the range of possible gain or loss on an underlying asset or liability to specific range swap agreement is contract between two party to exchange cash flow based on specified underlying notional amount asset and or index we do not enter into derivative instrument for speculative purpose we record all derivative on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value and typically do not offset derivative asset and liability excluding interest rate swap and foreign currency debt we generally do not enter into derivative instrument with maturity longer than three year however we are allowed to net settle transaction with respective counterparties for certain derivative contract inclusive of interest rate swap and foreign currency forward with single net amount payable by one party to the other we also enter into collateral security arrangement that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instrument fluctuates from contractually established threshold of september and october we received million and million respectively of cash collateral related to the derivative instrument under collateral security arrangement of september and october the potential effect of netting arrangement with our derivative contract excluding the effect of collateral would be reduction to both derivative asset and liability of million and million respectively resulting in net derivative asset of million and net derivative liability of million of september and net derivative asset of million and net derivative liability of million of october by using these derivative instrument we expose to potential credit risk credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the term of the derivative contract we minimize this credit risk by entering into transaction with carefully selected credit worthy counterparties and distribute contract among several financial institution to reduce the concentration of credit risk cash flow hedgesfor derivative instrument that are designated and qualify cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is reported component of other comprehensive income oci and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci on our consolidated balance sheet the gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affect net earnings to the extent that the change in the fair value of the contract corresponds to the change in the value of the anticipated transaction using forward rate on monthly basis the hedge is considered effective and is recognized described above the remaining change in fair value of the contract represents the ineffective portion which is immediately recorded in interest income and other net on our consolidated statement of earnings cash flow hedge related to anticipated transaction are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the term of the contract to the underlying transaction cash flow from hedging transaction are classified in the same category the cash flow from the respective hedged item established cash flow hedge generally remain designated such until the hedged item impact net earnings or the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur for de designated cash flow hedge or for transaction that are no longer likely to occur the related accumulated derivative gain or loss are recognized in interest income and other net or interest expense on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction of contentsnet investment hedgesfor derivative instrument that are designated and qualify net investment hedge the effective portion of the derivative gain or loss is reported component of oci and recorded in aoci the gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated to the extent that the change in the fair value of the forward contract corresponds to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using spot rate on monthly basis the hedge is considered effective and is recognized described

immediately recognized in interest income and other net on our consolidated statement of earnings normal purchase normal salewe enter into fixed price and price to be fixed green coffee purchase commitment which are described further at note inventory for both fixed price and price to be fixed purchase commitment we expect to take delivery of and to utilize the coffee in reasonable period of time and in the conduct of normal business accordingly these purchase commitment qualify normal purchase and are not recorded at fair value on our balance sheet refer to note derivative financial instrument and note inventory for further discussion of our derivative instrument and green coffee purchase commitment receivables net of allowance for doubtful accountsour receivables are mainly comprised of receivables for product and equipment sale to and royalty from our licensee well receivables from our cpg customer our allowance for doubtful account is calculated based on historical experience customer credit risk and application of the specific identification method of september and october our allowance for doubtful account wa million and million respectively inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost primarily moving average cost or net realizable value we record inventory reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory count inventory reserve are based on inventory obsolescence trend historical experience and application of the specific identification method of september and october inventory reserve were million and million respectively property plant and equipmentproperty plant and equipment which includes asset under capital lease are carried at cost le accumulated depreciation cost includes all direct cost necessary to acquire and prepare asset for use including internal labor and overhead in some case depreciation is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from to year for equipment and to year for building leasehold improvement are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the related lease life generally year for lease with renewal period at our option we generally use the original lease term excluding renewal option period to determine estimated useful life if failure to exercise renewal option imposes an economic penalty to we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful life the portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facility is included in cost of sale including occupancy cost on our consolidated statement of earnings the cost of repair and maintenance are expensed when incurred while expenditure for refurbishment and improvement that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized when asset are disposed of whether through retirement or sale the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value le estimated cost to sell we evaluate property plant and equipment for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the of contentsasset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenue and operating cost using internal projection property plant and equipment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level we recognized net disposition charge of million million and million in fiscal and respectively additionally we recognized net impairment charge of million million and million in fiscal and respectively of the total net impairment charge million and million in fiscal and respectively were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expense unless it is restructuring related the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statement of earnings goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change such material deterioration in performance or significant number of store closure that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating goodwill for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit fair value is typically calculated using discounted cash flow model for certain reporting unit where deemed appropriate we may also utilize market approach for estimating fair value if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we may abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activity substantive process and asset that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset for goodwill related to our switzerland retail reporting unit we initially recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal this wa primarily due to the impact of the strength of the swiss franc continued shift of consumer behavior to neighboring country and the relocation of certain business sustaining beyond our projection and indicating the reporting unit carrying value would not be fully recovered since then the operational investment and improvement we made not sufficiently slow the performance decline and we recorded impairment charge of million for the remaining switzerland goodwill balance during fiscal noted above if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur due to the strategic decision to close teavana branded retail store and our subsequent review of this reporting unit fair value we recorded goodwill impairment charge of million during the third quarter of fiscal there were no material goodwill impairment charge recorded during fiscal refer to note other intangible asset and goodwill for further discussion other intangible assetsother intangible asset include finite lived intangible asset which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired right trade secret licensing agreement contract based patent and copyright these asset are amortized over their estimated useful life and are tested for impairment using similar methodology to our property plant and equipment described above indefinite lived intangible which consist primarily of trade name and trademark are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating other intangible asset for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount of contentswe calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach such relief from royalty model if the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value in addition we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful life if and when fact and circumstance change there were no significant other intangible asset impairment charge recorded during fiscal and insurance reserveswe use combination of insurance and
