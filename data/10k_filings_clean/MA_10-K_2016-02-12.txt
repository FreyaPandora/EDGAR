largest component of the cost that acquirer charge merchant in connection with the acceptance of payment card although we do not earn revenue from interchange fee they are factor on which we compete with other payment provider and therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we see on our card we have historically set default interchange fee in the united state and certain other country in some jurisdiction however interchange fee and related practice are subject to regulatory activity and litigation that have limited our ability to establish default rate regulator and legislative body in number of country well merchant are seeking to reduce these fee through legislation competition related regulatory proceeding central bank regulation and or litigation more broadly regulator in several jurisdiction increasingly have been leveraging or seeking to establish the authority to regulate certain aspect of payment system such ours these regulation have and could further result in obligation or restriction with respect to not only interchange fee but also the type of product that we may offer to consumer the country in which our card and other payment device may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the type of cardholder and merchant who can obtain or accept our card these obligation and restriction could be further increased more jurisdiction impose oversight of payment system example of activity related to interchange fee and payment system include the european union adopted legislation in regulating electronic payment issued and acquired within the european economic area including cap on consumer credit and debit interchange fee and the separation of brand and processing see business recent business and legal regulatory development in part item for more detail of content the european commission issued statement of objection in july related to our interregional interchange fee and central acquiring rule within the european economic area legislation regulating the level of domestic interchange fee ha been enacted or is being considered in many jurisdiction these jurisdiction include australia where the reserve bank of australia ha proposed further reduction to debit interchange well interchange fee cap on commercial and cross border transaction several jurisdiction have created or granted authority to create new regulatory body that either have or would have the authority to regulate payment system including the united kingdom and india which have designated payment system subject to regulation well brazil mexico and russia additionally merchant are seeking to reduce interchange fee and impact acceptance rule through litigation such litigation includes individual and or class action suit filed by merchant against mastercard visa and our customer in the united state and canada well claim filed by retailer against mastercard in the united kingdom and other european jusrisdictions see note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for more detail regarding litigation proceeding and inquiry related to interchange fee if issuer can not collect or we are forced to reduce interchange fee issuer will be unable to use interchange fee to recoup portion of the cost incurred for their service this could reduce the number of financial institution willing to participate in our four party payment system lower overall transaction volume and or make proprietary three party network or other form of payment more attractive issuer could also choose to charge higher fee to consumer to attempt to recoup portion of the cost incurred for their service thereby making our card program le desirable to consumer and reducing our transaction volume and profitability in addition issuer could attempt to decrease the expense of their card and other payment program by seeking reduction in the fee that we charge to them this could also result in le innovation and fewer product offering we are devoting substantial management and financial resource to the defense of interchange fee in regulatory proceeding litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any legislative regulatory or litigation action could have more positive or negative impact on mastercard relative to it competitor if we are ultimately unsuccessful in our defense of interchange fee any such legislation regulation and or litigation may have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation in addition regulatory proceeding and litigation could result in mastercard being fined and or having to pay civil damage additionally increased focus by jurisdiction on regulating payment system may result in costly compliance burden and or may otherwise increase our cost which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance moreover failure to comply with the law and regulation discussed above to which we are subject could result in fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation well have an impact on our reputation in order to successfully compete in such an environment we and our customer would each need to adjust our strategy accordingly limitation on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our result of operation we have historically implemented policy referred to no surcharge rule in certain region including the united state that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using mastercard product instead of other mean authority in several jurisdiction have acted to end or limit the application of these no surcharge rule or indicated interest in doing so additionally pursuant to the term of settlement of the merchant class litigation we have modified our no surcharge rule to permit merchant to surcharge credit card subject to certain limitation it is possible that over time merchant in some or all merchant category in these jurisdiction may choose to surcharge permitted by the rule change this could result in consumer viewing our product le favorably and or using alternative mean of payment instead of electronic product which could result in decrease in our overall transaction volume and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our result of operation current regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdiction or product which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation regulator around the world increasingly look at each other approach to the regulation of the payment and other industry in some area such interchange fee we believe that regulator are increasingly cooperating on their approach consequently development in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in other country state or region for example decision in europe related to interchange fee could increase the possibility of additional competition authority in european member state opening interchange fee proceeding similarly new law and regulation in country state or region involving one product may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to another product for example regulation affecting debit transaction could lead to regulation of other product such credit of contentsas result the risk created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential they have to be replicated in other jurisdiction or involving other product affecting our business these include matter like interchange rate network standard and network exclusivity and routing agreement conversely if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our product service fee and other important aspect of our business with the effect either of these outcome could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation preferential or protective government action preferential and protective government action related to domestic payment service could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue government in some country such china russia and india have acted or in the future may act to provide resource preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and processing provider or have created or may in the future create their own national provider this action may displace from prevent from entering into or substantially restrict from participating in particular geography and may prevent from competing effectively against those provider for example government in some country are considering or may consider regulatory requirement that mandate processing of domestic payment either entirely in that country or by only domestic company in particular russia ha amended it national payment system law to require all payment system to process domestic transaction through government owned payment switch result all mastercard domestic transaction in russia are now processed by that system instead of by mastercard regional group of country such the gulf cooperation country in the middle east and number of country in south east asia are considering or may consider effort to restrict our participation in the processing of regional transaction such development would prevent and in russia have prevented from utilizing our global processing capability for domestic or regional customer our effort to effect change in or work with these country may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand privacy data protection and security regulation of privacy data protection and security could increase our cost well negatively impact our growth we are subject to regulation related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdiction in which we do business these regulation could result in negative impact to our business we continue to develop product and service to meet the need of changing marketplace we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data across multiple channel this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulation on our business regulation of privacy and data protection and information security may require change to our data practice in regard to the collection use disclosure or security of personal and sensitive information in addition due to the european court of justice recent invalidation of the safe harbor treaty we may be subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirement in the european union failure to comply with these law regulation and requirement could result in fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation and overall business well have an impact on our reputation new requirement in these area either from new regulation or law or any addition or change well the manner in which they could be interpreted or applied may also increase our cost and could impact aspect of our business such fraud monitoring the development of information based product and solution and technology operation in addition these requirement may increase the cost to our customer of issuing payment product which may in turn decrease the number of our card and other payment device that they issue moreover due to recent account data compromise event at large based retailer well the disclosure of the monitoring activity by certain governmental agency there ha been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirement any of these development could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation of contentsregulation related to our participation in the payment industryregulations affecting the global payment industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation we are subject to regulation that affect the payment industry in the many jurisdiction in which our card and other device are used in particular many of our customer are subject to regulation applicable to bank and other financial institution and consequently we are at time affected by such regulation regulation of the payment industry including regulation applicable to and our customer ha increased significantly in the last several year see business government regulation in part item for detailed description of such regulation and related legislation example include anti money laundering and economic sanction we are subject to aml law and regulation including the usa patriot act in the united state well the various economic sanction program administered by ofac including restriction on financial transaction with certain country and with person and entity included on ofac sanction list including the sdn list we have policy procedure and control designed to comply with applicable aml and ofac sanction requirement we take measure to prevent transaction that do not comply with ofac sanction including obligating our customer to screen cardholder and merchant against ofac sanction list however despite these measure it is possible that such transaction may be processed through our payment system activity such money laundering or terrorist financing involving our card could result in an enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customer association with those country person or entity or the existence of any such transaction any enforcement action or reputational damage could reduce the use and acceptance of our product and or increase our cost and thereby have material adverse impact on our business in addition geopolitical event and resulting ofac sanction could lead jurisdiction affected by those sanction to take action in response that could adversely affect our business for example in response to the global sanction imposed result of the ukraine conflict the russian government amended it national payment system law requiring all payment system to process domestic transaction through government owned payment switch there is risk that in the future other jurisdiction or their sympathizer may take similar or other action in response to sanction that could negatively impact consumer financial protection bureau cfpb in the united state the cfpb could regulate consumer financial product including amending existing requirement or imposing new one the cfpb also ha supervisory and independent examination authority well enforcement authority over certain financial institution their service provider and other entity which could include due to our processing of credit debit and prepaid transaction it is not clear whether and or to what extent the cfpb will regulate broader aspect of payment card network increased central bank oversight several central bank or similar regulatory body around the world that have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payment industry are in some case considering designating them systemically important payment system or critical infrastructure if mastercard were designated systemically important in particular jurisdiction it would be subject to new regulation relating to it payment clearing and settlement activity which could address area such risk management policy and procedure collateral requirement participant default policy and procedure the ability to complete timely clearing and settlement of financial transaction and capital and financial resource requirement also mastercard could be required to obtain prior approval for change to it system rule procedure or operation that could materially affect the level of risk presented by that payment system issuer practice legislation and regulation our financial institution customer are subject to numerous regulation which impact consequence existing or new regulation in these or other area may diminish the attractiveness of our product to our customer regulation of internet and digital transaction proposed legislation in various jurisdiction relating to internet gambling and other digital area such cyber security copyright trademark infringement and privacy could impose additional compliance burden on and or our customer including requiring or our customer to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various category of payment card transaction increased regulatory focus on such in connection with the matter discussed above may result in costly compliance burden and or may otherwise increase our cost similarly increased regulatory focus on our customer may cause such customer to reduce the volume of transaction processed through our system finally failure to comply with the law and regulation discussed above to which we are subject could result in fine sanction or other penalty each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and or our overall business and result of operation well have an impact on our reputation of contentscompetition substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the global payment industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the global payment industry is highly competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment including cash and check electronic mobile and commerce payment platform cryptocurrencies ach payment service and other payment network which can have several competitive impact on our business within the global general purpose payment industry we face substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide from system such visa american express discover unionpay jcb and paypal among others in certain jurisdiction including the united state visa ha greater volume scale and market share than we do which may provide significant competitive advantage visa ha also announced it purchase of visa europe which will create global company that may provide visa with additional competitive advantage some of our traditional competitor well alternative payment service provider may have substantially greater financial and other resource than we have may offer wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategy to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcome of litigation competition related regulatory proceeding central bank activity and legislative activity certain of our competitor including american express discover private label card network and certain alternative payment system operate three party payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer these competitor may derive competitive advantage from their business model operator of three party payment system tend to have greater control over consumer and merchant customer service than operator of four party payment system such ours in which we must typically rely on our issuing and acquiring financial institution customer our inability to control end to end processing may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to introduce value added program and service that are dependent upon processing the underlying transaction even when competitor operate program that utilize four party system these competitor have generally not attracted the same level of regulatory or legislative scrutiny of their pricing and business practice have operator of four party payment system such ours if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitor we operate four party system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in way in which our competitor are not we could lose business to these competitor see business competition in part item if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor drive value for our customer and or effectively align our resource with our goal and objective we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat our competitor may also more effectively introduce their own innovative program and service that adversely impact our growth we also compete against new entrant that have developed alternative payment system commerce payment system and payment system for mobile device well physical store location number of these new entrant rely principally on the internet to support their service and may enjoy lower cost than we do which could put at competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation disintermediation from stakeholder both within and outside of the payment value chain could harm our business the payment industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risk including party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position an intermediary in the payment process for example merchant could process and in some case are processing transaction directly with issuer additionally processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer large scale consolidation within processor could result in these processor developing bilateral agreement or in some case processing the entire transaction on their own network thereby disintermediating of content large digital company and other technology company that leverage our technology platform and network to deliver their product could develop platform or network that disintermediate from digital payment and impact our ability to compete physical and digital payment converge competitor customer large digital and other technology company government and other industry participant may develop product that compete with or replace value added product and service we currently provide to support our transaction switching and payment offering these product could replace our own processing and payment offering or could force to change our pricing or practice for these offering participant in the payment industry may merge create joint venture or form other business combination that may strengthen their existing business service or create new payment service that compete with our service our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our business and result of operation in order to increase transaction volume enter new market and expand our mastercard branded card and enabled payment device we seek to enter into business agreement with customer through which we offer incentive pricing discount and other support that promote our product in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentive and pricing discount over the past several year we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customer for better pricing arrangement and greater rebate and incentive moderate our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to process additional transaction volume or to provide additional service to our customer at level sufficient to compensate for such lower fee or increased cost in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition increased pressure on price increase the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those relating to customer incentive we may not succeed in these effort in the future we may not be able to enter into agreement with our customer on term that we consider favorable and we may be required to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitor are larger and have greater financial resource than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower price to our customer in addition to the extent that we offer discount or incentive under such agreement we will need to further increase transaction volume or the amount of service provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreement and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customer also may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase request for greater incentive or greater cost stability these factor could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation technologyrapid and significant technological development and change could negatively impact our result of operation or limit our future growth the payment industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change which can impact our business in several way technological change including continuing development of technology in the area of smart card and device contactless and mobile payment commerce and cryptocurrency and block chain technology could result in new technology that may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our program and service moreover these change could result in new and innovative payment method and program that could place at competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of mastercard product we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology the inability of these company to keep pace with technological development or the acquisition of these company by competitor could negatively impact mastercard offering our ability to develop and adopt new service and technology may be inhibited by industry wide solution and standard such those related to emv tokenization or other safety and security technology and by resistance from customer or merchant to such change of content our ability to develop evolving system and product may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining technology expert our ability to adopt these technology can also be inhibited by intellectual property right of third party we have received and we may in the future receive notice or inquiry from patent holder for example other operating company or non practicing entity suggesting that we may be infringing certain patent or that we need to license the use of their patent to avoid infringement such notice may among other thing threaten litigation against or our customer or demand significant license fee we work with large digital company and other technology company that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment related product and service quickly and efficiently to consumer our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customer to work with and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard failure to keep pace with these technological development or otherwise bring to market product that reflect these technology could lead to decline in the use of our product which could have material adverse impact on our result of operation information security and service disruption information security failure or breach could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our cost and cause loss information security risk for payment and technology company such mastercard have significantly increased in recent year in part because of the proliferation of new technology the use of the internet and telecommunication technology to conduct financial transaction and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime hacker terrorist and other external party these threat may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employee or third party or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threat include cyber attack such computer virus malicious code phishing attack or information security breach our operation rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer system and network our customer and other party in the payment value chain well our cardholder rely on our digital technology computer and email system software and network to conduct their operation in addition to access our product and service our customer and cardholder increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pc and other mobile device that may be beyond our control we routinely are subject to cyber threat and our technology system and network have been subject to cyber attack because of our position in the payment value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be target of such threat and attack additionally geopolitical event and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threat and attack by affected jurisdiction and their sympathizer to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber attack or other information security breach however if one or more of these event occurs it could lead to security breach of the network system or device that our customer use to access our product and service which could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromise such event could also cause service interruption malfunction or other failure in the physical infrastructure or operation system that support our business and customer such the lack of availability of our value added system well the operation of our customer or other third party any actual attack could lead to damage to our reputation with our customer and other party and the market additional cost to mastercard such repairing system adding new personnel or protection technology or compliance cost regulatory penalty financial loss to both and our customer and partner and the loss of customer and business opportunity if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded we maintain an information security program business continuity program and insurance coverage each reviewed by our board of director and it audit committee and our processing system incorporate multiple level of protection in order to address or otherwise mitigate these risk we also periodically test our system to discover and address any potential vulnerability despite these mitigation effort there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risk and not suffer loss in the future our risk and exposure to these matter remain heightened because of among other thing the evolving nature of these threat the prominent size and scale of mastercard and our role in the global payment and technology industry our plan to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategy and develop additional remote connectivity solution to serve our customer and cardholder when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third of contentsparty vendor and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunity result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our control process and practice designed to protect our system computer software data and network from attack damage or unauthorized access remain priority for cyber threat continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resource to continue to modify or enhance our protective measure or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerability any of the risk described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and result of operation service disruption that cause to be unable to process transaction or service our customer could materially affect our result of operation our transaction processing system and other offering may experience interruption result of disaster including but not limited to technology malfunction fire weather event power outage telecommunication disruption terrorism workplace violence accident or other catastrophic event our visibility in the global payment industry may also put at greater risk of attack by terrorist activist or hacker who intend to disrupt our facility and or system disaster that occurs at or in the vicinity of our primary and or back up facility in any global location could interrupt our service although we maintain business continuity program to analyze risk ass potential impact and develop effective response strategy we can not ensure that our business would be immune to these risk additionally we rely on third party service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed market could also result in service disruption which could impact our ability to do business in those market if one of our service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service because of the intrinsic importance of our processing system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of product carrying our brand and materially reduce our result of operation customerslosing significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customer could lead to significant revenue decrease in the longer term which could have material adverse impact on our business and our result of operation most of our customer relationship are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customer our customer can reassess their commitment to at any time in the future and or develop their own competitive service accordingly our business agreement with these customer may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customer may terminate their relationship with in favor of relationship with our competitor or for other reason or might not meet their contractual obligation to in addition significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customer loss of business from any of our large customer could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation exclusive near exclusive relationship certain customer have with our competitor may have material adverse impact on our business certain customer have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment product and these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to do significant amount of business with them to increase our revenue in addition these customer may be more successful and may grow faster than the customer that primarily issue our card which could put at competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customer with nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor such relationship could provide advantage to the customer to shift business from to the competitor with which they are principally aligned significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volume from these customer could have material adverse impact on our business consolidation in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the banking industry ha undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidation have included customer with substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institution with strong relationship with competitor if significant consolidation among customer were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for which could have material adverse impact on our business and prospect in addition one or more of our customer could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitor and any such transaction could also have material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce smaller number of large customer which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower price and or more favorable term for our customer these development could materially and adversely affect our result of operation of contentsstakeholdersour failure to maintain our relationship with issuer and acquirer may materially and adversely affect our business while we work directly with many stakeholder in the payment system including merchant government and large digital company and other technology company we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationship with our issuer and acquirer and their further relationship with cardholder and merchant to support our program and service we do not issue card or other payment device extend credit to cardholder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to cardholder using our product each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program feature in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchant are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customer result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and the strength of our relationship with them in turn our customer success depends on variety of factor over which we have little or no influence if our customer become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in risk factor settlement risk in this part item with respect to how we guarantee certain third party obligation for further discussion with the exception of the united state and select number of other jurisdiction most in country opposed to cross border transaction conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus card are authorized cleared and settled by our customer or other processor because we do not provide domestic processing service in these country and do not described above have direct relationship with cardholder we depend on our close working relationship with our customer to effectively manage our brand and the perception of our payment system among consumer in these country we also rely on these customer to help manage our brand and perception among regulator and merchant in these country alongside our own relationship with them from time to time our customer may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business if our customer action cause significant negative perception of the global payment industry or our brand cardholder may reduce the usage of our program which could reduce our revenue and negatively impact our result of operation merchant continued focus on acceptance cost may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding and increase our incentive program cost which could materially and adversely affect our profitability merchant are an important constituency in our payment system we rely on both our relationship with them well their relationship with our issuer and acquirer customer to continue to expand the acceptance of our card and payment device we also work with merchant to help them enable new sale channel create better purchase experience improve efficiency increase revenue and fight fraud in the retail industry there is set of larger merchant with increasingly global scope and influence we believe that these merchant are having significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry including mastercard some large merchant have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenge to interchange fee that mastercard ha been defending including the merchant litigation see our risk factor in this part item with respect to payment industry regulation including interchange fee the continued focus of merchant on the cost of accepting various form of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding merchant are also able to negotiate incentive from and pricing concession from our issuer and acquirer customer condition to accepting our payment card and device merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentive that we provide to certain merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer our work with government expose to unique risk that could have material impact on our business and result of operation we increase our work with national state and local government both indirectly through financial institution and with them directly our customer we may face various risk inherent in associating or contracting directly with government these risk include but are not limited to the following governmental entity typically fund project through appropriated monies change in governmental priority or other political development including disruption in governmental operation could impact approved funding and result in change in the scope or lead to the termination of the arrangement or contract we or financial institution enter into with respect to our payment product and service of content our work with government subject to and international anti corruption law including the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act violation and subsequent judgment or settlement under these law could subject to substantial monetary penalty and damage and have significant reputational impact working or contracting with government either directly or via our financial institution customer can subject to heightened reputational risk including extensive scrutiny and publicity well potential association with the policy of government result of business arrangement with that government any negative publicity or negative association with government entity regardless of it accuracy may adversely affect our reputation settlement and third party obligation riskour role guarantor expose to risk of loss or illiquidity guarantor of certain third party obligation including those of principal customer and affiliate debit licensee we are exposed to risk of loss or illiquidity we may incur obligation in connection with transaction settlement if an issuer or acquirer fails to fund it daily settlement obligation due to technical problem liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reason if principal customer or affiliate debit licensee of mastercard is unable to fulfill it settlement obligation to other customer we may bear the loss although we are not obligated to do so we may elect to keep merchant whole if an acquirer default on it merchant payment obligation or to keep prepaid cardholder whole if an issuer default on it obligation to safeguard unspent prepaid fund our gross settlement exposure for our brand wa approximately billion of december while we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure by our largest customer on it peak day including the availability of our revolving credit facility are able to seek assignment of underlying receivables from failed customer and may charge customer for settlement incurred during mastercard ordinary course activity the term and amount of our guarantee of obligation to principal customer is unlimited result concurrent settlement failure of more than one of our larger customer or of several of our smaller customer either on given day or over condensed period of time may exceed our available resource and could materially and adversely affect our overall business and liquidity even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may not be able to recover the cost of such payment and may therefore be exposed to significant loss which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation these condition subject to increased risk that we may have to perform under our settlement guarantee for more information on our settlement exposure and risk assessment and mitigation practice see note settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item separately mastercard also provides guarantee to certain customer and other company indemnifying them from loss stemming from our failure to perform with respect to our product and service or the failure of third party to perform any significant indemnification obligation which we owe to any such customer or other company could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation global economic and political environmentglobal financial market activity could result in material and adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation adverse economic trend including distress in financial market turmoil in specific economy around the world and additional government intervention have impacted the environment in which we operate the condition of the economic environment may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risk to our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following our customer may ørestrict credit line to cardholder or limit the issuance of new card to mitigate increasing cardholder default of contentsøimplement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase request for greater incentive or greater cost stability andødefault on their settlement obligation including result of sovereign default causing liquidity crisis for our other customer consumer spending can be negatively impacted by ødeclining economy foreign currency fluctuation and the pace of economic recovery which can change cross border travel pattern on which significant portion of our revenue is dependent and ølow level of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environment and those market experiencing relatively high unemployment government intervention including the effect of law regulation and or government investment in our customer may have potential negative effect on our business and our relationship with customer or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our product tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility any of these development could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation decline in cross border activity could adversely affect our result of operation we process substantially all cross border transaction using mastercard maestro and cirrus branded card and generate significant amount of revenue from cross border volume fee and transaction switching fee revenue from processing cross border and currency conversion transaction for our customer fluctuates with cross border travel and our customer need for transaction to be converted into their base currency cross border activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other condition these include the threat of terrorism and outbreak of flu virus and other disease any such decline in cross border activity could adversely affect our result of operation negative trend in consumer spending could negatively impact our result of operation the global payment industry depends heavily upon the overall level of consumer business and government spending general economic condition such unemployment housing and change in interest rate and other political condition such devaluation of currency and government restriction on consumer spending in key country in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or average purchase amount of transaction involving our payment card and device also we are headquartered in the united state negative perception of the united state could impact the perception of our company which could adversely affect our business adverse currency fluctuation and foreign exchange control could negatively impact our result of operation during approximately of our revenue wa generated from activity outside the united state this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in non

about certain item and future event that directly affect the company reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that the company considers to be the most critical to it financial statement an accounting estimate is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to the company financial condition senior management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit committee of the company board of director the company significant accounting policy including recent accounting pronouncement are described in note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item revenue recognitionapplication of the various accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires the company to make judgment and estimate specifically complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting domestic assessment revenue requires an estimate of our customer performance in order to recognize this revenue rebate and incentive are recorded reduction to gross revenue based on these estimate we consider various factor in estimating customer performance including review of specific transaction historical experience with that customer and market and economic condition difference between actual result and the company estimate are adjusted in the period the customer report actual performance if our customer actual performance is not consistent with our estimate of their performance net revenue may be materially different loss contingenciesthe company is currently involved in various claim and legal proceeding the company regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass it potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated the company accrues liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available the company reassesses the potential liability related to it pending claim and litigation and may revise it estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome see note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for further discussion income taxesin calculating our effective tax rate we need to make estimate regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible item which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdiction through our interpretation of local tax regulation adjustment to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdiction are reflected within various tax filing although we believe that our estimate and judgment discussed herein are reasonable actual result may be materially different than the estimated amount we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategy in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax asset in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is made with corresponding increase or decrease to earnings we record tax liability for uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority we consider all relevant fact and current authority in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained and if so how current law impact the amount reflected within these financial statement if upon examination we realize tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings in the period in certain situation the company will have offsetting tax credit or tax in other jurisdiction of contentswe do not record income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operation we consider business plan planning opportunity and expected future outcome in assessing the need for future expansion and support of our international operation if our business plan change or our future outcome differ from our expectation income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period valuation of assetsthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination and asset impairment review require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires the company to estimate the fair value of asset acquired liability assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration between asset that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset the company estimate are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuation require the use of management assumption which would not reflect unanticipated event and circumstance that may occur we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level the impairment evaluation utilizes quantitative assessment using two step impairment test the first step is to compare the reporting unit carrying value including goodwill to the fair value the company us market approach for estimating the fair value of it reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value then no potential impairment is considered to exist if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the second step is performed to determine if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment charge would be recorded if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible asset consists of qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant event and circumstance that could affect the significant input used to determine the fair value of indefinite lived intangible asset in performing the qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event and legal and regulatory factor if the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is le than their carrying amount the company must perform quantitative impairment test item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket risk is the potential for
