campaign during our total online advertising expense wa approximately billion substantial portion of which wa spent internationally through internet search engine meta search and travel research

mean although we intend to increase our offline advertising support for our brand including expanding campaign into additional market we recognize substantial majority of online advertising expense incurred at the time of booking but recognize most of our gross profit when the consumer travel is completed result online advertising expense may not be recognized in the period the associated gross profit advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in case outside of our control including average daily rate adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and then customer return directly to our website or mobile apps for future booking we use online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website result our online advertising expense ha significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition our online advertising ha grown faster than our gross profit due to lower return on investment roi from our online advertising brand mix within the priceline group and channel mix within our brand our online advertising roi have been year over year furthermore our international brand are generally growing faster than our brand and typically spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising finally certain of our brand are obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channel competition we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable to compete more effectively with we currently or potentially will compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such expedia hotel com hotwire elong carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity and lastminute com which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel hotel reservation service and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope car trawler ctrip homeaway makemytrip webjet rakuten jalan hotel urbano viajanet submarino viagens despegar decolar com bookit com cheapoair mr and mr smith odigeo and wotif large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel facebook groupon and living social traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator many of which combine physical location telephone service and online service such carlson wagonlit american express thomas cook and tui travel well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company and online travel search service and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such trivago in which expedia ha acquired majority ownership interest tripadvisor qunar skyscanner and hotelscombined tripadvisor the world leading travel research and review website and the world largest online travel service with over million unique monthly visitor across it website google the world largest search engine and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched meta search service and may create additional inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline ota and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for consumer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otas or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic tripadvisor ha begun supporting it meta search service with offline advertising and trivago leading meta search service in europe recently expanded it offline advertising campaign into the united state google offer hotel finder meta search service that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result result of our recent acquisition of kayak meta search service we now compete more directly with other meta search service meta search service kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider consumer attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior they may favor travel service offered by meta search site or search company over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in increase in profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in profit experienced by our ota brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otas by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor facilitates hotel reservation on it transaction website tingo and jetsetter and intends to allow consumer to make reservation while staying on tripadvisor to the extent consumer book travel service through meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search website or meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an ota like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation travel service provider including multi national hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider that sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance we have made significant progress creating mobile offering which have received strong review and solid download trend and which are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application instead of web browser if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple inc one of the most innovative and successful company in the world and the producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service or another mobile app mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation can offer reservation for example some accommodation offer room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount in expedia one of our largest competitor entered into partnership with groupon to sell accommodation reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name new entrant such hoteltonight backbid guestmob tingo hipmunk and room have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on accommodation reservation to consumer and that compete directly with if any of these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted accommodation room rate in august expedia and travelocity announced that they had entered into an exclusive long term strategic marketing agreement whereby expedia will power the technology platform for travelocity existing website in the united state and canada while providing travelocity access to expedia supply and customer service to the extent this enhances expedia and or travelocity ability to compete with in the affected market our market share and result of operation could be adversely affected competition in online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque accommodation reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque accommodation room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and we believe ha supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin with our opaque name your own price accommodation reservation service the name of the accommodation is not disclosed after booking we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate of our name your own price opaque accommodation service which began to experience decline in room night reservation in the third quarter of these and other competitor could also launch opaque rental car service which could negatively impact our opaque name your own price rental car service if expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque accommodation reservation service we may have le consumer demand for our opaque accommodation reservation service over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted accommodation room rate in an effort to compete more effectively these new offering in we launched express deal semi opaque price disclosed accommodation reservation service while express deal ha been significant contributor to the improved performance of our opaque accommodation reservation service the offering may not ultimately be successful at recovering or growing accommodation reservation service market share result of this increased competition our share of the discount accommodation reservation market in the united state could further decrease which would harm our business and result of operation we believe that number of factor including recent year over year increase in retail airfare could cause consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel further consumer attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior they may favor travel service offered by search company or meta search site over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in gross profit or increase in advertising and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our ota brand see risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance and risk factor recent trend in consumer adoption and use of mobile device create new challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system platform which designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability the platform are largely independent among booking com priceline com agoda com kayak and rentalcars com the software platform and architecture use variety of tool within each corporate implementation including server side java asp net perl php javascript and sql script integrated with oracle mysql mongodb cassandra and microsoft sql server database system these internal platform were designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such accommodation room airline ticket and rental car reservation system and financial service provider well individual accommodation service provider such individual hotel our application utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our worldwide operation are primarily hosted in england the netherlands hong kong switzerland and three location in the united state each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure ups conditioned power and hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data center all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back up system if one hosting facility were inaccessible for any reason we would need to divert all traffic to another hosting facility which may lead to disruption to our service resulting in foregone transaction and revenue and consumer complaint customer service for our international business is provided primarily through in house call center we outsource most of the call center and customer service function for our priceline com business and use real time interactive voice response system with transfer capability to our call center and customer service center property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering our service we regard the protection of our intellectual property critical to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on national federal state and common law right in the united state and internationally well variety of administrative procedure regulation convention and treaty we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right in our service we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we pursue the registration of our domain name trademark and service mark in the united state and internationally we currently hold numerous issued and international patent and pending and international patent application we file additional patent application on new invention we deem appropriate effective trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation we continue to expand internationally protecting our intellectual property right and other proprietary right involves an increasing number of jurisdiction process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location see risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property governmental regulation the service we provide are subject to various law and regulation for example our travel service are subject to law governing the offer and or sale of travel service well law requiring to register seller of travel in certain jurisdiction in addition our service may be subject to various taxing regulation see risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability risk factor our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of income tax in the future and risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation we are subject to law that require protection of user privacy and user data in our processing of travel reservation we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data in the united state europe and asia this data is increasingly subject to law and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction see risk factor our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability and risk factor cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business in addition our strategy involves rapid geographic expansion around the world including in asia south america and elsewhere many of which region and country have different legislation regulatory environment and tax law compliance with legal regulatory and tax requirement around the world place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence which may have an adverse effect on our business seasonalitya meaningful amount of gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which reservation are booked however we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation checkout for the year for our north american and european business in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example if easter fall in the first quarter of the year but fell in the second quarter of the prior year year over year first quarter growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin can be favorably affected whereas second quarter year over year growth rate would be negatively affected the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result employee of december we employed approximately employee of which approximately are based in the united state and approximately are based outside the united state we also retain independent contractor to support our customer service website content translation and system support function we have never had work stoppage and our employee are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we consider our relation with our employee to be good our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense see risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed the priceline group website we maintain website with the address www booking com www priceline com www agoda com www kayak com and www rentalcars com among others we are not including the information contained on our website part

addition the priceline com incorporated code of conduct is available through the www priceline com website and any amendment to or waiver from the code of conduct will be disclosed on that website risk factor the following risk factor and other information included in this annual report should be carefully considered the risk and uncertainty described are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business result of operation or financial condition if any of the following risk occur our business financial condition operating result and cash flow could be materially adversely affected decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance our financial prospect are significantly dependent upon the sale of travel service particularly leisure travel travel including accommodation including hotel bed and breakfast hostel apartment vacation rental and other property rental car and airline ticket reservation is dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service tend to decline during general economic downturn and recession when consumer engage in le discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel accordingly the recent worldwide recession led to weakening in the fundamental demand for our travel reservation service and an increase in the number of consumer who canceled existing travel reservation with also during the recession the accommodation industry experienced significant decrease in occupancy rate and average daily rate adrs while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in accommodation provider increasing their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for accommodation reservation transaction change proportionately with price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and negative effect on our gross profit further many government around the world including the government and certain european government are operating at large financial deficit resulting in high level of sovereign debt in such country failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solution to these issue ha resulted in high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook this uncertainty well concern over governmental austerity measure including higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel adrs across many region of the world particularly in those european country that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainty we believe that these business trend are likely impacted by weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern disruption in the economy of such country could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition in addition during period of elevated uncertainty the value of the dollar compared to other currency including the euro ha often increased which adversely affect our gross booking gross profit operating income and net income expressed in dollar the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior across region which may differ make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation in addition other unforeseen event beyond our control such higher oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident can disrupt travel or otherwise result in decline in travel demand because these event are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service which can adversely affect our business and result of operation for example in late hurricane sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern united state in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda com business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in that market in addition thailand ha recently experienced disruptive civil unrest which ha negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in early thailand also experienced civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda com thailand based operation future natural disaster or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation we face risk related to the growth rate and expansion of our international business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our international operation include the netherlands based accommodation reservation service booking com the asia based accommodation reservation service agoda com the based rental car reservation service rentalcars com and to lesser extent kayak international meta search service our international operation have achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer this growth rate which ha contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue gross profit and earnings per share ha declined trend we expect to continue the absolute level of our gross booking grows larger other factor may also slow the growth rate of our revenue derived from our international business including for example worldwide economic condition any strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation adverse change in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market decline in the growth rate of our international business could have negative impact on our future gross profit and earnings per share growth rate and consequence our stock price our strategy involves continued rapid international expansion in region throughout the world many of these region have different custom currency level of customer acceptance of the internet legislation regulatory environment tax law and level of political stability international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult and costly and take more time than anticipated in addition compliance with non legal regulatory or tax requirement place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence in some market such china legal and other regulatory requirement may prohibit or limit participation by foreign business such by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel related business illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those market uneconomic which could make our entry into and expansion in those market difficult or impossible require that we work with local partner or result in higher operating cost if we are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding in new and existing market and managing that expansion our business result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our website including hotel bed and breakfast hostel and vacation rental vacation rental generally consist of among others property categorized single unit and multi unit villa holiday home apartment and chalet and are generally self catered include kitchen directly bookable property many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room lower adrs or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin for example because vacation rental is either single unit or small collection of independent unit vacation rental property represent more limited booking opportunity than non vacation rental property which generally have more unit to rent per property our non hotel accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor if we increase our non hotel accommodation business these different market characteristic could negatively impact our profit margin and if these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our website our gross booking growth rate and property growth rate will likely diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of non hotel accommodation increase the number of reservation per property will likely decrease we believe that the increase in the number of accommodation provider that participate on our website and the corresponding access to accommodation room night ha been key driver of the growth of our accommodation hotel reservation business the growth in our accommodation booking typically make an attractive source of consumer demand for our accommodation provider however accommodation provider may wish to limit the amount of business that flow through single distribution channel result we may experience constraint on the number of accommodation room night available to which could negatively impact our growth rate and result of operation the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from le than in the first quarter of to approximately of december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by our international operation including result of our international acquisition result of such rapid expansion the average tenure of our employee ha become shorter we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and otherwise harm our business in addition expansion increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function our current and planned personnel system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage this growth and our future operation especially we employ personnel in multiple geographic location around the world we are subject to risk typical of international business including differing economic condition differing custom language and consumer expectation change in political climate differing tax structure and other regulation and restriction including labor law and custom and foreign exchange rate volatility competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with we currently or potentially will compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such expedia hotel com hotwire elong carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity and lastminute com which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel hotel reservation service and hotel de which are owned by hotel reservation service and autoeurope car trawler ctrip homeaway makemytrip webjet rakuten jalan hotel urbano viajanet submarino viagens despegar decolar com bookit com cheapoair mr and mr smith odigeo and wotif large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel facebook groupon and living social traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator many of which combine physical location telephone service and online service such carlson wagonlit american express thomas cook and tui travel well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including joint effort by travel service provider such room key an online hotel reservation service owned by several major hotel company and online travel search and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such trivago in which expedia ha acquired majority ownership interest tripadvisor qunar skyscanner and hotelscombined tripadvisor the world leading travel research and review website and the world largest online travel service with over million unique monthly visitor across it website google the world largest search engine and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched meta search service and may create additional inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline ota and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for consumer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otas or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic tripadvisor ha begun supporting it meta search service with offline advertising and trivago leading meta search service in europe recently expanded it offline advertising campaign into the united state google offer hotel finder meta search service that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result result of our recent acquisition of kayak meta search service we now compete more directly with other meta search service meta search service kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider to the extent otas or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak whether due to it affiliation with or otherwise kayak business and result of operation could be harmed and the value of our investment in kayak could be adversely affected consumer attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior they may favor travel service offered by meta search site or search company over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in profit experienced by our ota brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otas by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor facilitates hotel reservation on it transaction website tingo and jetsetter and intends to allow consumer to make reservation while staying on tripadvisor to the extent consumer book travel service through meta search website or directly with travel service provider after meta search website or meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an ota like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation travel service provider including multi national hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider that sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours there ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation can offer reservation for example some accommodation offer reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount in expedia one of our largest competitor entered into partnership with groupon to sell accommodation reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name new entrant such hoteltonight backbid guestmob tingo hipmunk and room have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on accommodation reservation to consumer and that compete directly with if any of these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted accommodation room rate in august expedia and travelocity announced that they had entered into an exclusive long term strategic marketing agreement whereby expedia will power the technology platform for travelocity existing website in the united state and canada while providing travelocity access to expedia supply and customer service to the extent this arrangement enhances expedia and or travelocity ability to compete with in the affected market our market share and result of operation could be adversely affected competition in online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque accommodation reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque accommodation reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and we believe ha supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin with our opaque name your own price and express deal accommodation reservation service the name of the accommodation is not disclosed until after booking the reservation we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate of our name your own price opaque accommodation service which began to experience decline in room night reservation in the third quarter of these and other competitor could also launch opaque rental car service which could negatively impact our opaque name your own price rental car service if expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque accommodation reservation service we may have le consumer demand for our opaque accommodation reservation service over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted accommodation room rate in an effort to compete more effectively against these new offering in we launched express deal semi opaque price disclosed accommodation reservation service while express deal ha been significant contributor to the improved performance of our opaque accommodation reservation service the offering may not ultimately be successful at recovering or growing accommodation reservation service market share result of this increased competition our share of the discount accommodation reservation market in the united state could further decrease which would harm our business and result of operation we believe that number of factor including recent year over year increase in retail airfare could cause consumer to engage in increased shopping behavior before making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel further consumer attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior they may favor travel service offered by search company or meta search site over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in gross profit or increase in advertising and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our ota brand rely on online advertising channel to enhance our brand awareness and to generate significant amount of traffic to our website we believe that maintaining and expanding the booking com priceline com agoda com kayak and rentalcars com brand along with our other owned brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer effective online advertising ha been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success our competitor spend increasingly more on advertising we are required to spend more in order to maintain our brand recognition and in the case of online advertising to maintain and grow traffic to our website in addition we have invested considerable money and resource in the establishment and maintenance of the booking com priceline com agoda com kayak and rentalcars com brand and we will continue to invest resource in advertising marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of these brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected our advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and then having customer return directly to our website or mobile apps for future booking we use third party website including online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website result our online advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition our online advertising ha grown faster than our gross profit due to lower return on investment roi from our online advertising brand mix within the priceline group and channel mix within certain of our brand our online advertising roi were down year over year for the year ended december furthermore our international brand are generally growing faster than our brand and typically spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising finally certain of our brand are obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channel any reduction in our advertising efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced gross profit or gross profit growth or through advertising expense increasing faster than gross profit and thereby reducing margin and earnings growth recent trend in consumer adoption and use of mobile device create new challenge and may enable device company such apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service provider and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important we have made significant progress creating mobile offering that have received strong review and achieved solid download trend and that are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application instead of web browser further many consumer use mobile device based web browser instead of an app result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile website optimized for mobile device to provide customer with appealing easy to use mobile website functionality if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple one of the most innovative and successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service or another mobile app mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but are reporting our result in dollar result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation for example strengthening of the euro increase our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar while weakening of the euro decrease our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our financial result certain european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may become more widespread and could include the united state ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the british pound sterling the dollar and other currency sovereign debt issue in the european union could lead to further significant and potentially longer term devaluation of the euro against the dollar which would adversely impact our euro denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and travel service provider confidence in our service any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based system could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and result of operation we currently require consumer who use certain of our service to guarantee their offer with their credit card either online or in some instance through our toll free telephone service we require user name and password in order to access our information technology system we also use encryption and authentication technology to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to our data or account it is possible that computer circumvention capability new discovery or advance or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of consumer data for example third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee or customer to disclose user name password or other sensitive information phishing which may in turn be used to access our information technology system our effort to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempt to book reservation through our service any of which could result in lost business and materially adversely affect our business reputation and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing security breach party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information in the last year several major company including target zappos apple aol linkedin google and yahoo experienced high profile security breach that exposed their customer personal information we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and we may need to increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security or to address problem caused and liability incurred by breach these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced security breach could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction security breach could also cause consumer to lose confidence in our security and choose to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share and our result of operation our insurance policy carry low coverage limit and would likely not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could inhibit the growth of the internet and negatively affect consumer willingness to provide private information or effect transaction on the internet generally including through our service some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system additionally consumer using our service could be affected by security breach at third party such travel service provider or global distribution system gd upon which we rely security breach at any such third party marketing affiliate travel service provider gd or other third party on which we rely could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and in any event could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement which could expose to liability in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary including employee information these law continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction non compliance with these law could result in penalty or significant legal liability we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business result of operation or financial condition we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with payment card processor under these rule and obligation if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuer for associated expense and penalty in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standard even if no customer information is compromised we could incur significant fine or experience significant increase in payment card transaction cost system capacity constraint system failure or denial of service or other attack could harm our business we have experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our website and through our mobile apps the number of accommodation on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation further an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between and consumer source of internet traffic such google and our travel service provider consumer increasingly turn to mobile device we also become dependent on consumer access to the internet through mobile carrier and their system disruption in internet access whether generally in specific market or otherwise especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur our computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand or result in consumer choosing to use competitive service any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing attack on our system and any such attack could cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time there are numerous other potential form of attack such phishing where third party attempt to infiltrate our system or acquire information by posing legitimate inquiry or electronic communication sql injection where third party attempt to obtain information or otherwise insert malicious code into our software through data entry field in our website and attempting to use our website platform to launch denial of service attack on another party each of which could cause significant interruption in our operation and potentially adversely affect our brand operation and result of operation or involve in legal or regulatory proceeding we expend significant resource in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effect of any such attack reduction in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volume during the of any such attack on our system and measure we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced successful attack could result in negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumer from booking travel service through during the attack any of which could cause consumer to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share and our result of operation we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the accommodation rental car and airline industry in connection with providing some of our service any interruption in these third party service system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we depend upon various third party to process credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transaction and related revenue until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor we do not have completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that can be substantial increase customer service cost harm our reputation and cause some consumer to switch to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the third party system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair we may have exposure to additional tax liability an international business providing travel reservation and advertising service around the world we are subject to income tax and non income based tax in both the united state and various non jurisdiction due to economic and political condition tax rate in various jurisdiction may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset or change in tax law or their interpretation if our effective tax rate were to increase our cash flow financial condition and result of operation would be adversely affected although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow if future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our cash flow financial condition and result of operation for example french authority have initiated an audit to determine whether we are in compliance with our tax obligation in france while we believe that we comply with french tax law french tax authority may determine that we owe additional tax and may also ass penalty and interest in general government in the united state and europe are increasingly focused on way to increase revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity and harsher stance by tax authority any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we will be subject to increased income tax in the event that our cash balance held outside the united state are remitted to the united state of december we held approximately billion of cash cash equivalent and short term investment outside of the united state we currently intend to use our cash held outside the united state to reinvest in our non operation if our cash balance outside the united state continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balance outside the united state diminishes it will become increasingly likely that we will repatriate some of these cash balance to the united state in such event we would likely be subject to additional income tax expense in the united state with respect to our unremitted non earnings we would not make additional income tax payment unless we were to actually repatriate our international cash balance to the united state we would only pay federal alternative minimum tax and certain state income tax long we have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset our taxable income additionally if we were to repatriate cash held outside the united state to the united state it would use portion of our net operating loss carryforwards which could result in being subject to cash income tax liability on the earnings of our business sooner than would otherwise have been the case president barack obama administration ha proposed significant change to international tax law that include minimum tax on foreign earnings limiting deduction for interest expense related to un repatriated non source income and putting in place certain tax disincentive for offshoring job or business segment we can not determine whether all of these proposal will be enacted into law or what if any change may be made to such proposal prior to being enacted into law if tax law change in manner that increase our tax obligation our result of operation could be adversely impacted additionally the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd issued an action plan in july calling for coordinated multi jurisdictional approach to base erosion and profit shifting by multinational company the action plan expressed the oecd view that international tax standard have not kept pace with change in global business practice and concluded that change are needed to international tax law to address situation where multinationals may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdiction by shifting profit away from jurisdiction where the activity creating those profit may take place the action plan identified action the oecd determined are needed to address base erosion and profit shifting and generally set target date for completion of each of the item between and any change to international tax law including new definition of permanent establishment could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity any change in or international taxation of our activity may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and could adversely affect our financial position and result of operation we are also subject to non income based tax such value added payroll sale use net worth property and good and service tax in the united state and various non jurisdiction well the potential for travel transaction tax in the united state discussed below from time to time we are under audit by tax authority with respect to these non income based tax and may have exposure to additional non income based tax liability for example in july and december the dutch government enacted certain amendment to dutch tax law including one time irrevocable levy on an employer applied to employee earnings equal to of an employee earnings in excess of euro this levy resulted in additional payroll tax of approximately million approximately million after tax in the fourth quarter of and approximately million approximately million after tax principally recorded in the third quarter of we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activity is taxed at the rate of innovation box tax rather than the dutch statutory rate of booking com obtained ruling from the dutch tax authority in february confirming that portion of it earnings qualifying earnings is eligible for innovation box tax treatment this ruling wa renewed in july and is valid through december in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain research and development certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative the certificate is current but should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any future period for example because the governmental agency not view booking com new or anticipated activity innovative or should this agency determine that the activity contemplated to be performed in prior period were not performed contemplated or not with the agency requirement booking com may lose it certificate and result the innovation box tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated booking com intends to apply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period however booking com application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced or the applicable tax rate on qualifying earnings may be higher than the current rate in addition the tax law may change resulting in reduction or elimination of the tax benefit the loss of the innovation box tax benefit would increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our result of operation our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of income tax in the future until our net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire we do not expect to make tax payment on most of our income except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax however we expect to pay non tax on our non income other than in country where we have operating loss carryfowards we expect that our international business will continue to generate most of our revenue and profit and will continue to grow pretax income at higher rate than our business and therefore we expect that our tax payment will continue to increase any increase in our effective tax rate would have an adverse effect on our result of operation adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against online travel company including related to among other thing the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc in addition number of state county and municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax see note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively or prospectively or both in connection with some travel transaction tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe that we are subject to such tax and even if we make such payment we intend to continue to vigorously assert our position that we should not be subject to such tax litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in september the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the city and against online travel company similarly in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that online travel company including are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the online travel company collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel we recorded an accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest and penalty of approximately million in december and approximately million in the three month ended march primarily related to this ruling during the year ended december the company paid approximately million under protest to the state of hawaii related to this ruling the company ha filed an appeal with the tax appeal court and intends to vigorously appeal this ruling these decision and any similar decision in other jurisdiction could have material adverse effect on our business margin and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our result of operation or cash flow in any given fiscal period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of travel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our travel reservation service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or travel service provider and reduce our travel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce our profit on affected travel transaction either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with travel transaction tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate travel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our travel service with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis we are dependent on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket we rely on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket to make their service available to consumer through our arrangement with travel service provider generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket or to make accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price during the course of our business we are in continuous dialog with our major travel service provider about the nature and extent of their participation in our service significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with consumer in their participation in our service for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our service in favor of one of our competitor system or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed further kayak meta search service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider to attract consumer to obtain this information kayak maintains relationship with travel service provider and otas many of kayak agreement with travel service provider and otas are short term agreement that may be terminated on day notice to the extent otas or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak whether due to it affiliation with or otherwise kayak ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumer could be diminished and it brand business and result of operation could be harmed to the extent consumer do not view kayak reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumer would likely visit it website which would also likely have negative impact on kayak advertising revenue and result of operation in addition if travel service provider or otas choose not to advertise with kayak or choose to reduce or eliminate the fee paid to kayak for referral from query result kayak result of operation and the value of our investment in kayak could be materially adversely affected our business could be negatively affected by change in internet search engine algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we utilize google and to much lesser extent other search engine and travel demand aggregation website to generate traffic to our website principally through the purchase of travel related keywords search engine such google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our website can be negatively affected for example google launched hotel finder utility that allows consumer to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the consumer and that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result if google change it search algorithm in manner that is competitively disadvantageous to whether to support it own travel related service or otherwise our ability to generate traffic to our website would be harmed which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation significant amount of our website traffic is directed to our website through participation in pay per click advertising campaign on internet search engine whose pricing and operating dynamic can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively in addition we purchase website traffic from number of source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we rely on various third party distribution channel marketing affiliate to distribute hotel room and rental car reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search engine ranking due to change in search engine algorithm or otherwise our business and result of operation could be negatively affected rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of certain key senior management in the united state europe and asia are critical to the overall management of our business we may not be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense both in the united state and abroad our international success in particular ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our international employee our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employee and to retain and motivate existing employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining and motivating existing employee our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could harm our business the service we offer are subject to legal regulation including law ordinance rule and other requirement and regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation our ability to provide our service is and will continue to be affected by such regulation the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation compliance with the law and regulation of multiple jurisdiction increase our cost of business these law and regulation which vary and sometimes conflict include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law tax law antitrust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country could delay or prevent potential acquisition and could also materially damage our reputation our brand our international expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee our business and our operating result in addition these restriction may provide competitive advantage to our competitor unless they are also subject to comparable restriction our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other regulatory and legal risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and anti trust law our ability to repatriate fund held by our non subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country our business ha grown substantially over the last several year and continues to expand into new geographic location in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to audit by tax authority in various jurisdiction the size of our business grows we may become increasingly subject to the scrutiny of anti trust and competition regulator in july the office of fair trading the oft the competition authority in the united kingdom issued statement of objection so to booking com which set out the oft preliminary view on it believed booking com others in the online accommodation reservation sector were allegedly in breach of and competition law the so alleged among other thing that there were agreement or concerted practice between accommodation and booking com and at least one other online travel company that restricted booking com and the other online travel company ability to discount hotel room reservation which the oft alleged wa form of resale price maintenance we dispute the allegation against booking com in the so booking com run an agency model accommodation reservation platform in which accommodation have complete discretion and control over setting the price that appear on the booking com website booking com is facilitator of accommodation room reservation it doe not take possession of or title to accommodation room and is not reseller of accommodation room because booking com play no role in price setting doe not control pricing and doe not resell accommodation room it doe not believe that it engages in the conduct alleged in the so on august the oft announced it intention to accept commitment offered by booking com well expedia and intercontinental hotel group to close the investigation the oft sought feedback on the proposed commitment from the public in light of the feedback received during the consultation and input from the european commission the party submitted revised commitment on december the oft opened further public consultation on the revised commitment proposed by the party this further consultation closed on january on january the oft announced that it accepted the revised commitment commitment from the party on the basis that they address the oft competition concern the oft ha now closed it investigation with no finding of infringement or admission of wrongdoing and no imposition of fine the commitment provide among other thing that hotel will continue to be able to set retail price for hotel room reservation on all online travel company website such booking com online travel company such booking com now have the flexibility to discount hotel retail price but only to member of closed group concept that is defined in the commitment who have previously made reservation with the online travel company the discount may be up to booking com commission in addition booking com will not require rate parity from hotel in relation to discounted rate that are provided by other online travel company or hotel to member of their closed group provided the discounted rate is not made public the commitment apply to booking by eea resident at hotel in addition the competition authority of many government have begun investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result for example national competition authority in france germany austria hungary sweden and switzerland have opened investigation that focus on booking com rate parity clause in it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction all of these investigation are at preliminary stage we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these investigation or our business may be affected possible outcome include requiring booking com to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction we note that the german competition authority ha required hotel reservation service to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with hotel though this decision is currently subject to appeal to the extent that regulatory authority require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding any such investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and result of operation further our business grows we may increasingly become the target of such investigation or be limited by anti trust or competition law for example our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition or our ability to expand into complementary business any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business cookie is text file that is stored on user web browser by website cooky are common tool used by thousand of website including ours to among other thing store or gather information remember log on detail so user doe not have to enter them when revisiting website and enhance the user experience on website cooky are valuable tool for website like ours to improve the customer experience and increase conversion on their website the european union eprivacy directive requires member country to adopt regulation governing the use of cooky by website servicing consumer in the european union for example on june an amendment to the dutch telecommunication act became effective the amended act requires website including booking com to provide dutch user with clear and comprehensive information about the storage and use of certain cooky and obtain prior consent from the user before placing certain cooky on user web browser to the extent any such regulation require opt in consent before certain cooky can be placed on user web browser our ability in particular booking com ability to serve certain customer in the manner we currently do might be adversely affected and our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our website might be impaired either of which could negatively affect consumer experience using our service result these regulation could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor quarterly variation in our operating result change in expectation to our future financial performance including financial estimate by security analyst and investor worldwide economic condition in general and in europe in particular fluctuation in currency exchange rate particularly between the dollar and the euro announcement of technological innovation or new service by or our competitor change in our capital structure change in market valuation of other internet or online service company announcement by or our competitor of price reduction promotion significant contract acquisition strategic partnership joint venture or capital commitment loss of major travel service provider participant such hotel chain rental car company or airline from our service change in the status of our intellectual property right lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of litigation proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding occurrence of significant security breach addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation sale of substantial number of share of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business we have in the past been defendant in security class action litigation security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in cost and divert management attention and resource either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the emergence and growth of the use of smart phone and tablet for mobile commerce transaction including through the increasing use of mobile apps result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service to evolving industry standard and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of our service in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in particular we believe that it will be increasingly important for to effectively offer our service through mobile application and mobile optimized website on smart phone and tablet any failure by to successfully develop and achieve customer adoption of our mobile application and mobile optimized website would likely have material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and result of operation we believe that ease of use comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile apps and mobile optimized website will be increasingly competitively critical consumer obtain more of their travel service through mobile device result we intend to continue to spend significant resource maintaining developing and enhancing our website including our mobile optimized website and our mobile apps and other technology in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to those new technology which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition for example kayak generates revenue in part by allowing consumer to compare search result that appear in additional pop under window recent change in browser functionality may either block or otherwise limit the use of pop under window which could have negative impact on our revenue any failure to implement or adapt to new technology in timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our customer acquisition cost or otherwise adversely affect our business and therefore adversely affect our brand market share and result of operation we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee travel service provider partner and others to protect our proprietary right we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property in the united state and other jurisdiction and we currently hold number of issued patent in multiple jurisdiction further in the future we may acquire additional patent or patent portfolio which could require significant cash expenditure however we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other mean of protecting our intellectual property we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party and these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online we may be required to expend significant time and resource to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property right while we believe that our intellectual property right including our issued patent and pending patent application help to protect our business there can be no assurance that third party will not have or obtain one or more patent that can prevent from practicing feature of our business or that will require to pay for license to use those feature our operation do not or will not infringe valid enforceable patent of third party we can successfully defend our patent against challenge by third party pending patent application will result in the issuance of patent competitor or potential competitor will not devise new method of competing with that are not covered by our patent or patent application because of variation in the application of our business model to each of our service our patent will be effective in preventing one or more third party from utilizing copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more category new prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent or legislative or judicial action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of our patent right including the ability to obtain and enforce so called business method patent if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property it could have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and ha and is likely to continue to divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject to possible litigation we use open source software in connection with our software development from time to time company that use open source software have faced claim challenging the use of open source software and or compliance with open source license term we could be subject to suit by party claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non compliance with open source licensing term some open source license require user who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software which in some circumstance could include valuable proprietary code of the user while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in manner that would require to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the term of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in part because open source license term are often ambiguous any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damage for breach of contract could be harmful to our business result of operation or financial condition and could help our competitor develop service that are similar to or better than ours our business is exposed to risk associated with processing credit card transaction our result have been negatively impacted by purchase made using fraudulent credit card because we act the merchant of record in majority of our priceline com transaction well those of agoda com and rentalcars com we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain retail transaction when we do not act merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card chargebacks if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition in the event that one of our major travel service provider voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such travel service provider for example airline that participate in our service and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy ourselves because we are the merchant of record on sale of name your own price airline ticket to our customer however we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition for example in april aloha airline and ata airline each ceased operation and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with ticket on those airline agoda com and rentalcars com process credit card transaction and operate in numerous currency credit card cost are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and in instance where cancellation occur success of our recent acquisition of kayak is subject to numerous risk and uncertainty result of our acquisition of kayak we are subject to risk associated with kayak business such risk include continued access to travel service information provided by other otas and travel service provider reduction in advertising on kayak website by competitor of ours consumer adoption of meta search service generally and kayak service in particular and kayak ability to expand it offering into international market uncertainty regarding kayak business operation following the acquisition may cause consumer travel service provider and advertiser to delay or defer decision concerning kayak service some of our competitor such expedia have commercial arrangement with kayak that they may decide to terminate or not renew out of competitive concern related to our ownership of kayak in addition management focus and resource could be diverted from the day to day operation of the business to matter relating to integration of kayak with the priceline group current and prospective kayak employee may experience uncertainty about their future role with or may decide that they do not want to work for the priceline group which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key kayak management sale marketing operation and technical personnel any of these risk could harm kayak business and result of operation and adversely affect the value of our investment in kayak substantial portion of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of the kayak business in may if kayak is unsuccessful in profitably growing it global online travel brand or it experience significant reduction in advertising revenue due to factor such loss of continued access to travel service information provided by other otas and travel service provider or reduction in advertising on it website and mobile apps we may incur an impairment charge related to this goodwill investment in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy or acquisition such endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return of capital and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or adversely affect the value of our investment further we may issue share of our common stock in these transaction which could result in dilution to our stockholder item unresolved staff comment none item property our corporate headquarters and the headquarters of our priceline com business are located in norwalk connecticut united state of america where we lease approximately square foot of office space our booking com business is headquartered in amsterdam netherlands where we lease approximately square foot of office space our agoda com business ha significant support operation in bangkok thailand where we lease approximately square foot of office space our kayak business is headquartered in stamford connecticut united state of america where we lease approximately square foot of office space and our

around the world including hosting and data center facility in the united state the united kingdom switzerland the netherlands and hong kong and sale and support facility in numerous location we do not own any real estate of december we believe that our existing facility are adequate to meet our current requirement and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available needed to accommodate any further expansion of corporate operation item legal proceeding litigation related to travel transaction tax we and certain third party online travel company otcs are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc our subsidiary lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the otcs violated each jurisdiction respective relevant travel transaction tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint typically seek compensatory damage

proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california which have been inactive for several year issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter we believe that the law at issue do not apply to the service we provide namely the facilitation of travel reservation and therefore that we do not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather we believe that the law at issue generally impose travel transaction tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation or other travel service in addition in many of these matter the taxing jurisdiction have asserted claim for conversion essentially that we have collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that we believe is without basis and have vigorously contested the taxing jurisdiction that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time we have found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city and county of san francisco assessed approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which we paid in july and issued second assessment totaling approximately million which we paid in january payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such tax and even if such payment are made we intend to continue to assert our position vigorously that we should not be subject to such tax in the san francisco action for example the court ruled in february that we and otcs do not owe transient accommodation tax to the city and ordered the city to refund the pay first amount paid in july we also are seeking refund of the amount paid first in january the city ha taken the position that it need not refund the pay first amount until after it ha exhausted all appeal litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that we and other otcs are not liable for the state transient accommodation tax but held that the otcs including are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the otc collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel we recorded an accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest and penalty with corresponding charge to cost of revenue of approximately million in december and approximately million in the three month ended march primarily related to this ruling during the twelve month ended december we paid approximately million under protest to the state of hawaii related to this ruling we have filed an appeal now pending before the hawaii supreme court and intend to vigorously appeal this ruling other adverse ruling include decision in september in which the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the district and against the otcs ruling that tax is due on the otcs margin and service fee also in july the circuit court of cook county illinois ruled that we and the other otcs are liable for tax and other obligation under chicago hotel accommodation tax in addition in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other otcs that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance we intend to vigorously appeal the trial court final judgment an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and could be material to our result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of travel reservation to our customer and consequently could make our travel reservation service le competitive compared to the service of other otcs or travel service provider and reduce our travel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service either action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we estimate that since our inception through december we have earned aggregate gross profit including fee from our entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this gross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that we believe have aggregate tax rate which may include hotel occupancy tax and state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on it historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate hotel reservation have not asserted that these tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis the gross profit figure above reflects all jurisdiction including those where legal proceeding have been resolved and some jurisdiction that have chosen to revise their tax ordinance rather than pursue claim for past tax reserve for travel transaction tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for the potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax in the amount of approximately million at december compared to approximately million at december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in the state of hawaii district of columbia san antonio and chicago the accrual is based on our estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issue our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made development in and after the year ended december in and after the year ended december ten new action commenced fargo expedia inc et al district court for ca county north dakota filed

booking com represented approximately of our gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and approximately of our consolidated operating income significant majority of our gross profit is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservation we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following source commission earned from facilitating reservation of accommodation rental car cruise and other travel service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our accommodation rental car and vacation package reservation service advertising revenue primarily earned by kayak from sending referral to travel service provider and otas well from advertising placement on kayak website and mobile apps and global distribution system gd reservation booking fee related to our name your own price accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation service and price disclosed airline ticket and rental car reservation service the retail and semi opaque travel service offered by our and international brand are recorded in revenue on net basis and have no associated cost of revenue our priceline com brand offer merchant name your own price opaque travel service which are recorded in revenue on gross basis and have associated cost of revenue therefore revenue increase and decrease are impacted by change in the mix of our revenue between name your own price travel service and other travel service gross profit reflects the commission or net margin earned for our retail name your own price and semi opaque travel service consequently gross profit ha become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business because in contrast to our revenue it is not affected by the mix between our name your own price travel service and our other travel service over the last several year we have experienced strong growth in our accommodation reservation service we believe this growth is the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the widespread adoption of mobile device the high growth of travel overall in emerging market such asia pacific and south america and the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to build accommodation supply content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our website and mobile apps we experienced strong year over year growth in recent year though that growth ha generally decelerated for example for the year ended december our accommodation room night reservation growth wa deceleration from in and in given size of our hotel reservation business we believe it is highly likely that our year over year growth rate will continue to decelerate though the rate of deceleration may fluctuate many government around the world including the government and certain european government are operating at large financial deficit resulting in high level of sovereign debt in such country failure to reach political consensus regarding workable solution to these issue ha resulted in high level of uncertainty regarding the future economic outlook this uncertainty well concern over governmental austerity measure including higher tax and reduced government spending could impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those european country that appear to be most affected by economic uncertainty we believe that these business trend are likely impacted by weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern disruption in the economy of such country could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition in addition during period of elevated uncertainty the value of the dollar compared to other currency including the euro ha often increased which adversely affect our gross booking gross profit operating income and net income expressed in dollar the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior across region which may differ make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation we compete with both online and traditional travel reservation service the market for the travel reservation service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple and facebook have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with we currently or potentially will compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such those owned by expedia orbitz travelocity ctrip rakuten odigeo jalan and wotif large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google facebook and groupon traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator such carlson wagonlit american express thomas cook and tui travel well thousand of individual travel agency around the world travel service provider such accommodation provider rental car company and airline and online travel search and price comparison service generally referred to meta search service such trivago in which expedia ha acquired majority ownership interest tripadvisor qunar and hotelscombined tripadvisor the world leading travel research and review website and the world largest online travel service with over million unique monthly visitor across it website google the world largest search engine and other large established company with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic have launched meta search service and may create additional inroad into online travel both in the united state and internationally meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider hotel rental car company or airline ota and other travel website and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otas or other travel website which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic tripadvisor ha begun supporting it meta search service with offline advertising and trivago leading meta search service in europe recently expanded it offline advertising campaign into the united state google offer hotel finder meta search service that google ha at time placed at or near the top of hotel related search result result of our recent acquisition of kayak meta search service we now compete more directly with other meta search service meta search service kayak depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otas and travel service provider consumer attempt to be more efficient in their shopping behavior they may favor travel service offered by meta search website or search company over otas which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation website increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and website and increase our advertising and other customer acquisition cost to the extent any such consumer behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in profit from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in profit experienced by ota brand further meta search service may evolve into more traditional otas by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their website for example tripadvisor facilitates hotel reservation on it transactional website tingo and jetsetter and intends to allow consumer to make reservation while staying on tripadvisor to the extent consumer book travel service through meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search website or meta search utility on traditional search engine without using an ota like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result we may need to increase our advertising or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation travel service provider including multi national hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone android enabled smart phone and tablet such the ipad coupled with the improved web browsing functionality and development of thousand of useful apps available on these device is driving substantial traffic and commerce activity to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform our major competitor and certain new market entrant are offering mobile application for travel product and other functionality including proprietary last minute discount for accommodation reservation advertising and distribution opportunity may be more limited on mobile device given their smaller screen size the gross profit earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of tablet and smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple travel service provider and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty are likely to become increasingly important we have made significant progress creating mobile offering which have received strong review and solid download trend and which are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer and to mobile application instead of web browser if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile apps are not downloaded and used by consumer we could lose market share to existing competitor or new entrant and our future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected apple inc one of the most innovative and successful company in the world and producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes passbook virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smart phone category and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel passbook siri apple voice recognition concierge service or another mobile app mean of entering the travel reservation marketplace similarly google android operating system is the leading smart phone operating system in the world result google could leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result to the extent apple or google use their mobile operating system or app distribution channel to favor their own travel service offering our business could be harmed there ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation for example some accommodation offer reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount in expedia one of our largest competitor entered into partnership with groupon to facilitate accommodation reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name new entrant such hoteltonight backbid guestmob tingo hipmunk and room have developed new and differentiated offering that endeavor to provide saving on accommodation reservation to consumer and that compete directly with if any of these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate august expedia and travelocity announced that they had entered into an exclusive long term strategic marketing agreement whereby expedia will power the technology platform for travelocity existing website in the united state and canada while providing travelocity access to expedia supply and customer service to the extent this arrangement enhances expedia and or travelocity ability to compete with in the affected market our market share and result of operation could be adversely affected we use third party website including online search engine primarily google and meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing primary mean of generating traffic to our website result our online advertising expense ha increased significantly in recent year trend we expect to continue in addition our online advertising expense ha generally been growing faster than our gross profit due to lower return on investment roi from our online advertising brand mix within the priceline group and channel mix within certain of our brand our online advertising roi were down year over year for the year ended december furthermore our international brand are generally growing faster than our brand and typically spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising finally certain of our brand are obtaining an increasing share of traffic through paid online advertising channel we also intend to continue to invest in offline advertising in particular for our booking com priceline com and kayak brand and expect to increase our overall offline advertising spend in for example building on it first offline advertising campaign which it launched in the united state in booking com recently began offline advertising campaign in australia canada and the united kingdom and may expand it offline advertising into other market during the inclusion of kayak since it acquisition on may had favorable impact on online advertising percentage of gross profit for the year ended december because kayak spends lower percentage of gross profit on online advertising than our other brand and our consolidated result exclude intercompany advertising by our brand on kayak this favorable impact will benefit year over year comparison until the anniversary of the acquisition on may advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and then having customer return directly to our website or mobile apps for future booking international trend the size of the travel market outside of the united state is substantially greater than that within the united state historically internet adoption rate and commerce adoption rate of international consumer have trailed those of the united state however international consumer are rapidly moving to online mean for purchasing travel accordingly recent international online travel growth rate have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rate within the united state we expect that over the long term international online travel growth rate will follow similar trend to that experienced in the united state in addition the base of hotel property in europe and asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the united state where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chain we believe online reservation system like ours may be more appealing to small chain and independent hotel more commonly found outside of the united state our growth ha primarily been generated by our international accommodation reservation service brand booking com and agoda com booking com our most significant brand includes over property on it website of february updated property count are available on the booking com website booking com ha added property over the past year in it core european market well higher growth market such north america which is newer market for booking com asia pacific and south america an increasing amount of our business from both destination and point of sale perspective is conducted in these newer market which are growing faster than our overall growth rate we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the market in which we operate we believe these trend and factor have enabled to become the leading online accommodation reservation service provider in the world measured by room night booked our international business represents the substantial majority of our financial result we expect to continue to see our operating result and other financial metric largely driven by international performance for example certain newer market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in adding accommodation available for reservation on our website including hotel bed and breakfast hostel and vacation rental vacation rental generally consist of among others property categorized single unit and multi unit villa holiday home apartment and chalet and are generally self catered include kitchen directly bookable property many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room lower adrs or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin for example because vacation rental is either single unit or small collection of independent unit vacation rental property represent more limited booking opportunity than non vacation rental property which generally have more unit to rent per property our non hotel in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor if we increase our non hotel accommodation business these different market characteristic could negatively impact our profit margin and if these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our website our gross booking growth rate and property growth rate will likely diverge over time since each such property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of non hotel accommodation increase the number of reservation per property will likely decrease another impact of the size of our international business is our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk because we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state and report our result in dollar we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation for example strengthening of the euro increase our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar while weakening of the euro decrease our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar certain european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the united state ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the dollar and other currency we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result however such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross booking revenue or gross profit see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract for example while revenue from our international operation grew year over year on local currency basis by approximately for the year ended december compared to the same period in result of the positive impact of currency exchange rate revenue from our international operation reported in dollar grew for the year ended december the competition authority of many government have begun investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result for example national competition authority in france germany austria hungary sweden and switzerland have opened investigation that focus on booking com rate parity clause in it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction all of these investigation are at preliminary stage we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these investigation or how our business may be affected possible outcome include requiring booking com to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with accommodation provider in those jurisdiction we note that the german competition authority ha required hotel reservation service to remove it rate parity clause from it contract with hotel though this decision is currently subject to appeal to the extent that regulatory authority require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding any such investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our market share and result of operation further our business grows we may increasingly become the target of such investigation or be limited by anti trust or competition law for example our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition or our ability to expand into complementary business any of which could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete domestic trend competition in online travel remains intense and online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque hotel reservation service to consumer an area in which our priceline com business ha been leader ha become more intense for example expedia make opaque hotel reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha we believe supported this initiative with steeper discount through lower margin with our opaque name your own price and express deal hotel reservation service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after booking the reservation we believe these offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year room night reservation growth rate for our name your own price opaque hotel reservation service which began to experience decline in the third quarter of in addition some hotel offer discounted room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social if expedia or others are successful in growing their opaque hotel reservation service and or daily deal website are successful in garnering sizable share of discounted hotel booking we may have le consumer demand for our opaque hotel reservation service over time and we would face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate in an effort to compete more effectively against these new offering in we launched express deal semi opaque price disclosed hotel reservation service while express deal ha been significant contributor to the improved performance of our opaque hotel reservation service the offering may not ultimately be successful at recovering or growing hotel reservation service market share result of this increased competition our share of the discount hotel reservation market in the united state could further decrease demand for online travel service in the united state continues to experience growth we believe that the market share of third party distributor is impacted in part by concerted initiative by travel service provider to direct customer to their own website in an effort to reduce distribution expense and establish more direct control over their pricing airline have at time reduced capacity and increased fare decrease in capacity reduce the amount of airline ticket available while significant increase in average airfare have adversely impacted leisure travel demand generally reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline com air ticket reservation service which in turn can have negative repercussion on our priceline com hotel and rental car service we expect continued variability in the breadth and depth of discounted airline ticket and rental car rate made available to in the future depending on market condition from time to time seasonality meaningful amount of gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which reservation are booked however we generally do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of accommodation checkout for the year for our north american and european business in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in our first quarter year over year growth rate in revenue gross profit operating income and operating margin were favorably affected by easter falling in the first quarter instead of the second quarter in conversely those year over year growth rate were negatively impacted in our second quarter the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable advertising expense in addition gross profit growth is typically le impacted in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result other factor we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel service and further expand into other international market factor beyond our control such worldwide recession higher oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority or travel related accident could adversely affect our business and result of operation and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiative described above for example in late hurricane sandy disrupted travel in the northeastern united state in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda com business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in addition thailand ha recently experienced disruptive civil unrest which ha negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in early thailand also experienced civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda com thailand based operation future natural disaster or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating margin we have experienced pressure on operating margin we prioritize initiative that drive growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing merger and acquisition our goal is to grow gross profit and achieve healthy operating margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain environment described above make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we may not be able to sustain gross profit growth and profitability may we acquired kayak software corporation leading travel meta search service in stock and cash transaction the purchase value wa billion

financial statement for further information on the acquisition critical accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting policy and estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain in applying those policy our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to the item described below those estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our significant accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following accounting for travel transaction tax discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement we are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc in addition over seventy nine municipality or county and at least thirteen state have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively historically we have not collected travel transaction tax on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transaction however in handful of jurisdiction we have been required recently by passage of new statute or by court order to start collecting and remitting certain tax local occupancy and or sale or excise tax imposed upon our margin and or service fee or in the case of hawaii on the full amount collected from the consumer the ultimate resolution of these matter in all jurisdiction can not be determined at this time we have established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax for prior and current period consistent with applicable accounting principle and in light of all current fact and circumstance we accrue for legal contingency where it is probable that loss ha occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued variety of factor could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factor include but are not limited to the number of and amount of gross profit represented by jurisdiction that ultimately assert claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate settlement and change in relevant statute the ultimate resolution of these matter may be greater or le than the liability recorded stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based award over the recipient service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award number of our equity award have performance target performance contingency which if satisfied can increase the number of share issued to the recipient at the end of the performance period or in certain instance if not satisfied reduce the number of share issued to the recipient sometimes to zero at the end of the performance period the performance period for our performance based equity award are typically three year we record stock based compensation expense for these performance based award based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period the estimated performance against the performance target we periodically adjust the cumulative stock based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance based award is updated based upon change in actual and forecasted operating result stock based compensation for the year ended december and includes charge amounting to million million and million respectively representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share unit our actual performance against the performance target could differ materially from our estimate we record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture in determining the estimated forfeiture rate we periodically review actual and projected forfeiture to the extent that actual or projected rate differ from current estimate such amount are recorded cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised valuation of goodwill we have recorded goodwill related to business we have acquired goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation technique in the event that future circumstance indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired an impairment charge would be recorded substantial portion of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of the kayak business in may if kayak is unsuccessful in profitably growing it global online travel brand or it experience significant reduction in advertising revenue due to factor such loss of continued access to travel service information provided by other otas and travel service provider or reduction in advertising on it website and mobile apps we may incur an impairment charge related to this goodwill the estimated fair value of our other reporting unit substantially exceed their respective carrying value since the annual impairment test in september there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment valuation of long lived asset and intangible we evaluate whether event or circumstance have occurred which indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset and intangible may be impaired the significant factor that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include change in business strategy market condition or the manner of use of an asset under performance relative to historical or expected future operating result and negative industry or economic trend in evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimate that asset future undiscounted cash flow to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to it carrying value the fair value represents the projected discounted cash flow of the asset over it

relating to the payment of travel transaction tax to date the majority of taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate the making of travel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our travel service with respect to jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis see note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding and part item risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in this annual report result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual for the probable cost of resolving issue related to travel transaction tax in the amount of approximately million at december and approximately million at december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in the state of hawaii district of columbia san antonio and chicago our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made we believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determination in the near term in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated given result to date because of our available cash it would not have material impact on our liquidity the following table represents our material contractual obligation and commitment of december see note to the

resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax refer to note to the consolidated financial statement and approximately million related to unrecognized tax benefit refer to note to the

accordingly we have classified the estimated liability non current on the consolidated balance sheet we have excluded other long term liability in the amount of million from the contractual obligation table because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment since the contingent conversion threshold for the convertible senior note due wa exceeded of december these note are convertible at the option of the holder if the holder elect to convert we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we will deliver cash or share of common stock at our option for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount we would likely fund our conversion obligation with cash and cash equivalent short term investment and borrowing under our revolving credit facility we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our then current stockholder would be diluted we may not generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future revenue growth or sustained profitability may not be realized and future borrowing or equity sale may not be available in amount sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditure finance our strategy or repay our indebtedness off balance sheet arrangement of december we did not have any off balance sheet arrangement that have or are reasonably likely to have current or future effect on our financial condition result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and currency exchange rate affect general economic condition we would also be affected by such change we did not experience any material change in interest rate exposure during the year ended december based upon economic condition and leading market indicator at december we do not foresee significant adverse change in interest rate in the near future fixed rate investment are subject to unrealized gain and loss due to interest rate volatility we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the fair value of our available for sale investment assuming an adverse change of basis point hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment of december of approximately million these hypothetical loss would only be realized if we sold the investment prior to their maturity of december the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt is billion we estimate that the market value of such debt wa approximately billion of december substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bond we conduct significant portion of our business outside the united state through subsidiary with functional currency other than the dollar primarily euro result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the operating result of our international operation are translated from local currency into dollar upon consolidation if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income similarly our net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income will decrease if the dollar strengthens against the local currency additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operation from time to time we enter into foreign exchange derivative contract to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result our derivative contract principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the euro and the british pound sterling versus the dollar of december and there were no such outstanding derivative contract foreign exchange gain of million million and million for the year ended december and respectively were recorded in foreign currency transaction and other in the consolidated statement of operation of december and we had outstanding forward currency contract with notional value of billion euro and billion euro respectively that are designated hedge of our net investment in foreign subsidiary for accounting purpose these contract are all short term in nature mark to market adjustment on these net investment hedge are recorded currency translation adjustment the fair value of these derivative at december wa liability of million with million recorded in accrued expense and other current liability and million recorded in prepaid and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet the fair value of these derivative at december wa liability of million with million recorded in accrued expense and other current liability and recorded in prepaid expense and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet hypothetical strengthening of the foreign exchange rate relative

taxing jurisdiction in which the company is taxpayer commitment and contingency litigation related to travel transaction tax the company and certain third party online travel company otcs are currently involved in approximately forty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of travel transaction tax hotel occupancy tax excise tax sale tax etc the company subsidiary lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the otcs violated each jurisdiction respective relevant travel transaction tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief in addition approximately seventy nine municipality or county and at least thirteen state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california which have been inactive for several year issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that the company is subject to travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter the company belief that the law at issue do not apply to the service it provides namely the facilitation of travel reservation and therefore that it doe not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather the company belief that the law at issue generally impose travel transaction tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation or other travel service in addition in many of these matter the taxing jurisdiction have asserted claim for conversion essentially that the company ha collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that the company belief is without basis and ha vigorously contested the taxing jurisdiction that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with the company and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time the company ha found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment the company may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the law in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city and county of san francisco assessed the company approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which the company paid in july and issued second assessment totaling approximately million which the company paid in january payment of these amount if any is not an admission that the company belief it is subject to such tax and even if such payment are made the company intends to continue to assert it position vigorously that it should not be subject to such tax in the san francisco action for example the court ruled in february that the company and otcs do not owe transient accommodation tax to the city and ordered the city to refund the pay first amount paid in july the company also is seeking refund of the amount paid first in january the city ha taken the position that it need not refund the pay first amount until after it ha exhausted all appeal litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in january the tax appeal court for the state of hawaii held that the company and other otcs are not liable for the state transient accommodation tax but held that the otcs including the company are liable for the state general excise tax on the full amount the otc collect from the customer for hotel room reservation without any offset for amount passed through to the hotel the company recorded an accrual for travel transaction tax including estimated interest and penalty with corresponding charge to cost of revenue of approximately million in december and approximately million in the three month ended march primarily related to this ruling during the twelve month ended december the company paid approximately million under protest to the state of hawaii related to this ruling the company ha filed an appeal now pending before the hawaii supreme court and intends to vigorously appeal this ruling other adverse ruling include decision in september in which the superior court in the district of columbia granted summary judgment in favor of the district and against the otcs ruling that tax is due on the otcs margin and service fee also in july the circuit court of cook county illinois ruled that the company and the other otcs are liable for tax and other obligation under chicago hotel accommodation tax in addition in october jury in san antonio class action found that the company and the other otcs that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance the company intends to vigorously appeal the trial court final judgment an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending the company position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on the company business and could be material to the company result of operation or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that the company ha tax collection responsibility or the company determines that it ha such responsibility with respect to future transaction the company may collect any such additional tax obligation from it customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of travel reservation to it customer and consequently could make the company travel reservation service le competitive compared to the service of other otcs or travel service provider and reduce the company travel reservation transaction alternatively the company could choose to reduce the compensation for it service either action could have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation the company estimate that since it inception through december it ha earned aggregate gross profit including fee from it entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for the company service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this gross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that the company belief have aggregate tax rate which may include hotel occupancy tax and state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date the taxing jurisdiction seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on the company gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to the company liability for tax owed on it historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which the company facilitates hotel reservation have not asserted that these tax are due and payable on the company merchant hotel business with respect to taxing jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from the company only on prospective basis the gross profit figure above reflects all jurisdiction including those where legal proceeding have been resolved and some jurisdiction that have chosen to revise their tax ordinance rather than pursue claim for past tax reserve for travel transaction tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax the company ha established an accrual including estimated interest and penalty for the potential resolution of issue related to travel transaction tax in the amount of approximately million at december compared to approximately million at december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in the state of hawaii district of columbia san antonio and chicago the accrual is based on the company estimate of the probable cost of resolving these issue the company legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for reasonably possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made development in and after the year ended december in and after the year ended december ten new action commenced fargo expedia inc et al district court for ca county north
