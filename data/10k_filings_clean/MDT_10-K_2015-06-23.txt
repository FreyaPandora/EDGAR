emphasis on cost effectiveness in health care delivery the current trend among hospital and other customer is to consolidate into larger purchasing group to enhance purchasing power this enhanced purchasing power may lead to pressure on pricing and increased use of preferred vendor our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic change across the geographic market we serve we are not dependent on any single customer for more than percent of our total net sale competition and industrywe compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical market in approximately country

it officer and employee could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalty including substantial fine and damage and exclusion from participation supplier of product to beneficiary covered by medicare or medicaid product approval processesauthorization to commercially distribute new medical device or technology in the is generally received in one of two way the first known pre market notification or the process requires to demonstrate that our new medical device or technology is substantially equivalent to legally marketed medical device or technology in this process we must submit data that support our equivalence claim if human clinical data is required it must be gathered in compliance with fda investigational device exemption regulation we must receive an order from the fda finding substantial equivalence to another legally marketed medical device or technology before we can commercially distribute the new medical device or technology modification to cleared medical device or technology can be made without using the process if the change do not significantly affect safety or effectiveness covidien product are generally subject to the pre market notification process small number of our device are exempt from pre market review the second more rigorous process known pre market approval pma requires to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective we do this by collecting data regarding design material bench and animal testing and human clinical data for the medical device the fda will authorize commercial distribution if it determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective this determination is based on the benefit outweighing the risk for the population intended to be treated with the device this process is much more detailed time consuming and expensive than the process third seldom used process for approval exists for humanitarian use device intended for patient population of le than patient per year in the this exemption is similar to the pma process however full showing of product effectiveness from large clinical trial is not required the threshold for approving these product is probable benefit and safety many country outside the to which we export medical device also subject such medical device and technology to their own regulatory requirement frequently regulatory approval may first be obtained in foreign country prior to application in the due to differing regulatory requirement however other country such china for example require approval in the country of origin first most country outside of the require that product approval be recertified on regular basis generally every five year the recertification process requires that we evaluate any device or technology change and any new regulation or standard relevant to the device or technology and where needed conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance where recertification application are required they must be approved in order to continue selling our product in those country export control and economic sanction law and regulation are complex and constantly changing we can not assure you that law and regulation may not be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in manner materially impacting our ability to sell or distribute product in the european union eu single regulatory approval process exists and conformity with the legal requirement is represented by the ce mark to obtain ce mark defined product must meet minimum standard of performance safety and quality the essential requirement and then according to their classification comply with one or more of selection of conformity assessment route notified body ass the quality management system of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the essential and other requirement within the medical device directive medtronic is subject to inspection by notified body for compliance the competent authority of the eu country generally in the form of their ministry or department of health oversee the clinical research for medical device and are responsible for market surveillance of product once they are placed on the market we are required to report device failure and injury potentially related to product use to these authority in timely manner various penalty exist for non compliance with the law transcribing the medical device directive to be sold in japan most medical device must undergo thorough safety examination and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval or shonin the japanese government through the ministry of health labour and welfare mhlw regulates medical device under the pharmaceutical affair law pal oversight for medical device is conducted with participation by the pharmaceutical and medical device agency pmda quasi government organization performing many of the review function for mhlw penalty for company noncompliance with pal could be severe including revocation or suspension of company business license and criminal sanction mhlw and pmda also ass the quality management system of the manufacturer and the product conformity to the requirement of the pal medtronic is subject to inspection for compliance by these agency our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable which could increase the time cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approval for our product several country that not have regulatory requirement for of contentsmedical device have established such requirement in recent year and other country have expanded or plan to expand on existing regulation certain regulator are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data while harmonization of global regulation ha been pursued requirement continue to differ significantly among country we expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve which could impact our ability to obtain future approval for our product or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approval in the future there can be no assurance that any new medical device we develop will be approved in timely or cost effective manner or approved at all ongoing fda regulationsboth before and after product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibility under fda regulation the fda review design and manufacturing practice labeling and record keeping and manufacturer required report of adverse experience and other information to identify potential problem with marketed medical device we are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda quality system regulation which govern the method used in and the facility and control used for the design manufacture packaging and servicing of all finished medical device intended for human use in addition the fda and other regulatory body including the federal trade commission the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human service the department of justice doj and various state attorney general monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our product although surgeon are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical device for indication other than those cleared or approved by the fda we are prohibited from promoting product for such label us and can only market our product for cleared or approved us if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law or regulation or that any of our medical device are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could require to notify health professional and others that the device present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health order recall repair replacement or refund of such device detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical device or ban such medical device the fda may also impose operating restriction enjoin and or restrain certain conduct resulting in violation of applicable law pertaining to medical device including hold on approving new device issue are resolved to it satisfaction and ass civil or criminal penalty against our officer employee or the fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj conduct giving rise to civil or criminal penalty may also form the basis for private civil litigation by third party payer or other person allegedly harmed by our conduct in april we entered into consent decree with the fda relating to our neuromodulation business synchromed drug infusion system and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree requires the company to complete certain correction and enhancement to the synchromed pump and the neuromodulation quality system the consent decree limit the company ability to manufacture and distribute the synchromed drug infusion system unless specific condition are met the agreement not require the retrieval of any of the company product but the company must retain third party expert to inspect the neuromodulation quality system and to provide certification that the system complies with the requirement of the consent decree once this certification is provided to the fda satisfaction the limitation on manufacturer and distribution of synchromed pump will be lifted thereafter the company must submit periodic audit report to the fda to ensure ongoing compliance with the consent decree governmental trade regulationsthe sale and shipment of our product and service across international border well the purchase of component and product from international source subject to extensive governmental trade regulation variety of law and regulation both in the and in the country in which we transact business apply to the sale shipment and provision of good service and technology across international border because we are subject to extensive regulation in the country in which we operate we are subject to the risk that law and regulation could change in way that would expose to additional cost penalty or liability these law and regulation govern among other thing our import and export activity the fda in cooperation with custom and border protection cbp administers control over the import of medical device into the the cbp imposes it own regulatory requirement on the import of our product including inspection and possible sanction for noncompliance medtronic is also subject to foreign trade control administered by several government agency including the bureau of industry and security within the commerce department and the office of foreign asset control within the treasury department we import raw material component and finished product into the country in which we transact business we act the import of record in many instance but we also sell and ship good to third party who are responsible for complying with applicable trade law and regulation in our role importer of record we are directly responsible for complying with custom law and regulation concerning the importation of our raw material component and finished product if applicable government agency were to determine that we or such third party were not in compliance with applicable fda or custom law and regulation when engaging in cross border transaction involving our product we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degree of liability depending on the nature of the violation and of contentsthe extent of our culpability in addition such determination may cause supply chain disruption and delay in the distribution of our product that impact our business activity many country including the control the export and export of good technology and service for reason including public health national security regional stability antiterrorism policy and other reason in certain circumstance approval from governmental authority may be required before good technology or service are exported or re exported to certain destination to certain end user and for certain end us in addition international sale of our medical device that have not received fda approval are subject to fda export requirement government may also impose economic sanction against certain country person or entity in addition to our need to comply with such regulation in connection with our direct export activity we also sell and provide good technology and service to agent representative and distributor who may export such item to customer and end user if applicable government agency were to determine that we or the third party through which we export good were not in compliance with applicable export control or economic sanction law and regulation when engaging in transaction involving our product we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degree of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability similarly such determination may cause disruption or delay in the distribution and sale of our product or result in restriction placed upon our international distribution and sale of product which may materially impact our business activity anti boycott lawsunder law and regulation company and their controlled in fact foreign subsidiary and affiliate are prohibited from participating or agreeing to participate in unsanctioned foreign boycott in connection with certain business activity including the sale purchase transfer shipping or financing of good or service within the or the and foreign country currently the considers the arab league boycott of israel to constitute an unsanctioned foreign boycott we are responsible for ensuring we comply with the requirement of anti boycott law for all transaction in which we are involved if we or certain third party through which we sell or provide good or service are determined to have violated anti boycott law and regulation we may be subject to civil or criminal enforcement action and varying degree of liability dependent upon the nature of the violation and the extent of our culpability penalty for any violation of anti boycott law and regulation could include criminal penalty and civil sanction such fine imprisonment debarment from government contract loss of export privilege and the denial of certain tax benefit including foreign tax credit and foreign subsidiary deferral patient privacy lawsu federal and state law protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information including patient medical record and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by health care provider in particular in april the department of health and human service hhs published patient privacy rule under the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and in april published security rule for protected health information the hipaa privacy and security rule govern the use disclosure and security of protected health information by covered entity which are health care provider that submit electronic claim health plan and health care clearinghouses in congress passed the hitech act which modified certain provision of the hipaa privacy and security rule for covered entity and their business associate which is anyone that performs service on behalf of covered entity involving the use or disclosure of protected health information and is not member of the covered entity workforce these included directing hhs to publish more specific security standard and increasing breach notification requirement well tightening certain aspect of the privacy rule hhs published the final version of these new rule in january and covered entity and business associate were expected to be in compliance by september in addition the hitech act provided that business associate will be subject to the security requirement covered entity and that with regard to both the security and privacy rule business associate will be subject to direct enforcement by hhs including civil and criminal liability covered entity are in the past hipaa ha generally affected indirectly medtronic is generally not covered entity except for unit such our diabetes business medtronic monitoring inc and our health insurance plan medtronic only operates business associate to covered entity in limited number of instance in those case the patient data that we receive and analyze may include protected health information we are committed to maintaining the security and privacy of patient health information and believe that we meet the expectation of the hipaa rule some modification to our system and policy may be necessary but the framework is already in place however the potential for enforcement action against is now greater hhs can take action directly against business associate thus while we believe we are and will be in substantial compliance with hipaa standard there is no guarantee that the government will agree enforcement action can be costly and interrupt regular operation of our business we believe the ongoing cost and impact of assuring compliance with the hipaa privacy and security rule are not material to our business in addition there ha been developing trend of civil lawsuit and class action relating to breach of consumer data held by large company while medtronic ha not been named in any such suit if substantial breach or loss of data from our record were to occur we could become target of such litigation we are also impacted by the privacy requirement of country outside the united state privacy standard in europe and asia are becoming increasingly strict enforcement action and financial penalty related to privacy in the eu are growing and new of contentslaws and restriction are being passed the management of cross border transfer of information among and outside of eu member country is becoming more complex which may complicate our clinical research activity well product offering that involve transmission or use of clinical data china and russia have passed called data localization law which require multi national company that store certain individually identifiable data on their citizen to maintain that data on server located in their country restriction on transfer or processing of that data may apply well these law are new and the chinese and russian government have not yet issued guidance on they will apply or enforce the restriction may complicate our operation in those country adding complexity and additional management and oversight need we will continue our effort to comply with those requirement and to adapt our business process to applicable law cost containment initiativesgovernment and private sector initiative to limit the growth of health care cost including price regulation competitive pricing bidding and tender mechanic coverage and payment policy comparative effectiveness of therapy technology assessment and managed care arrangement are continuing in many country where we do business including the these change are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical device and therapy government program including medicare and medicaid private health care insurance and managed care plan have attempted to control cost by limiting the amount of reimbursement they will pay for particular procedure or treatment tying reimbursement to outcome shifting to population health management and other mechanism designed to constrain utilization and contain cost hospital which purchase implant are also seeking to reduce cost through variety of mechanism including for example creating centralized purchasing function that set pricing and in some case limiting the number of vendor that can participate in the purchasing program hospital are also aligning interest with physician through employment and other arrangement such gainsharing where hospital agrees with physician to share any realized cost saving resulting from the physician collective change in practice pattern such standardization of device where medically appropriate this ha created an increasing level of price sensitivity among customer for our product some third party payer must also approve coverage and set reimbursement level for new or innovative device or therapy before they will reimburse health care provider who use the medical device or therapy even though new medical device may have been cleared for commercial distribution we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement level have been obtained from governmental and private third party payer in addition some private third party payer require that certain procedure or that the use of certain product be authorized in advance condition of reimbursement international example of cost containment initiative and health care reform in market significant to medtronic business include japan where the government review reimbursement rate benchmark every two year which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedure using our medical device or deny coverage for those procedure result of our manufacturing efficiency cost control and other cost saving initiative we believe we are well positioned to respond to change resulting from the worldwide trend toward cost containment however uncertainty remains to the nature of any future legislation new or changed coverage and reimbursement government or private payor policy or decision or other reform making it difficult for to predict the potential impact of cost containment trend on future operating result regulation governing reimbursementthe delivery of our device is subject to regulation by hhs and comparable state and non agency responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care item and service law and regulation are imposed primarily in connection with the medicare and medicaid program well the government interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care foreign government also impose regulation in connection with their health care reimbursement program and the delivery of health care item and service federal health care law apply when we or customer submit claim for item or service that are reimbursed under medicare medicaid or other federally funded health care program the principal federal law include the anti kickback statute which prohibits offer to pay or receive remuneration of any kind for the purpose of purchasing ordering recommending making referral to item or service reimbursable by federal health care program the false claim act which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claim for payment to federally funded health care program including claim resulting from violation of the anti kickback statute the stark law which prohibits physician from referring medicare or medicaid patient to provider that bill these program for the provision of certain designated health service if the physician or member of the physician immediate family ha financial relationship with that provider and health care fraud statute that prohibit false statement and improper claim to any third party payer there are often similar state false claim anti kickback and anti self referral and insurance law that apply to state funded medicaid and other health care program and private third party payer insurance company can also bring private cause of action for treble damage against manufacturer for pattern of causing false claim to be filed under the federal racketeer influenced and corrupt organization act or rico in addition the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa can be used to prosecute company in the for arrangement with physician or other party outside the if the physician or party is government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country of contentsthe law and regulation of health care good and service that are applicable to including those described above are subject to evolving interpretation and enforcement discretion if governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law and regulation we and our officer and employee could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalty including for example exclusion from participation supplier of product to beneficiary covered by medicare any failure to comply with law and regulation relating to reimbursement and health care good and service could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flow our profitability and operation are subject to risk relating to change in and foreign legislative regulatory and reimbursement policy and decision well change to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decision and policy implementation of further legislative or administrative reform to the reimbursement system in the and abroad or adverse decision relating to our product by administrator of these system in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our product and the price that our customer are willing to pay for them environmental health and safety lawswe are also subject to various environmental health and safety law and regulation both within and outside the like other company in our industry our manufacturing and other operation involve the use and transportation of substance regulated under environmental health and safety law including those related to the transportation of hazardous material to the best of our knowledge at this time we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection law will have material impact on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow litigation riskspatent litigation we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation can result in significant damage award and injunction that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected product or result in significant royalty payment in order to continue selling the product at any given time we are involved both plaintiff and defendant in number of patent infringement action the outcome of which may not be known for prolonged period of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation incident to our business we believe the outcome associated with this type of litigation could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow for additional information see item risk factor we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and failing to protect such right or to be successful in litigation related to our right or the right of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and other proprietary right against others and note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form product liability and other claim we operate in an industry susceptible to significant product liability claim these claim may be brought by individual seeking relief on their own behalf or purporting to represent class we are also susceptible to other litigation including private security litigation shareholder derivative suit and contract litigation these claim may be asserted against in the future based on event we are not aware of at the present time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of product liability litigation we believe the outcome associated with this type of litigation could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow for additional information see item risk factor quality problem with and product liability claim in connection with our process good and service could lead to recall or safety alert harm our reputation and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and our cash flow and note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form self insurancewith the exception of insurance that covidien currently hold for certain risk we have elected to self insure most of our insurable risk we made this decision based on condition in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher level of self insurance retention increasing number of coverage limitation and dramatically higher insurance premium rate we maintain director and officer insurance policy providing limited coverage and we continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to of obtaining insurance coverage for other category of loss in the future based on historical loss trend we believe that our self insurance program accrual and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future loss historical trend however may not be indicative of future loss the absence of third party insurance coverage for other category of loss increase our exposure to unanticipated claim and these loss could have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow of contentssection of the exchange actunder section of the exchange act the company is required to include

discussed below each of the following risk be carefully considered based on the information currently known to we believe the following information identifies the most significant risk factor affecting our company however the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one related to our business and are not necessarily listed in the order of their importance additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business risk relating to the companywe operate in highly competitive industry and we may be unable to compete effectively we compete in both the therapeutic and diagnostic medical market in approximately country throughout the world these market are characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advance and scientific discovery in the product line in which we compete we face mixture of competitor ranging from large manufacturer with multiple business line to small manufacturer that offer limited selection of niche product development by other company of new or improved product process technology or the introduction of reprocessed product or generic version when our proprietary product lose their patent protection may make our product or proposed product le competitive in addition we face competition from provider of alternative medical therapy such pharmaceutical company competitive factor include product reliability product performance product technology product quality breadth of product line product service customer support price and reimbursement approval from health care insurance provider we also face competition for marketing distribution and collaborative development agreement for establishing relationship with academic and research institution and for license to intellectual property in addition academic institution governmental agency and other public and private research organization also may conduct research seek patient protection and establish collaborative arrangement for discovery research clinical development and marketing of product similar to these of contentscompanies and institution compete with in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel well in acquiring necessary product technology major shift in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problem physician advisory safety alert and publication about our product reflecting the importance of product quality product efficacy and quality system in our industry in the current environment of managed care consolidation among health care provider increased competition and declining reimbursement rate we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price in order to continue to compete effectively we must continue to create invest in or acquire advanced technology incorporate this technology into our proprietary product obtain regulatory approval in timely manner and manufacture and successfully market our product given these factor we can not guarantee that we will be able to compete effectively or continue our level of success in our industry reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative source for supply or other manufacturing difficulty may adversely affect our manufacturing operation and related product sale the manufacture of our product requires the timely delivery of sufficient amount of quality component and material and is highly exacting and complex due in part to strict regulatory requirement we manufacture most of our product at numerous manufacturing facility located throughout the world we purchase many of the component and raw material used in manufacturing these product from numerous supplier in various country we have generally been able to obtain adequate supply of such raw material and component however for reason of quality assurance cost effectiveness or availability we procure certain component and raw material from sole supplier we work closely with our supplier to try to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability however we can not guarantee that these effort will be successful in addition due to the stringent regulation and requirement of the fda regarding the manufacture of our product we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement source for certain component or material reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to develop alternative source for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our product in timely or cost effective manner and to make our related product sale other problem in the manufacturing process including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure defective raw material and environmental factor could lead to launch delay product shortage unanticipated cost lost revenue and damage to our reputation failure to identify and address manufacturing problem prior to the release of product to our customer may also result in quality or safety issue in addition several of our key product are manufactured at single manufacturing facility with limited alternate facility if an event occurs that result in damage to one or more of such facility we may be unable to manufacture the relevant product at the previous level or at all because of the time required to approve and license manufacturing facility third party manufacturer may not be available on timely basis to replace production capacity in the event manufacturing capacity is lost moreover pursuant to the conflict mineral requirement promulgated by the sec part of dodd frank we are required to report on the source of any conflict mineral used in our product well the process we use to determine the source of such material we will incur expense we work with our supplier to evaluate the source of any conflict mineral in our product and compliance with these requirement could adversely affect the sourcing supply and pricing of our raw material our industry is experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authority which may lead to greater regulation in the future our medical device and technology and our business activity are subject to complex regime of regulation and an aggressive enforcement environment including by the fda doj health and human service office of the inspector general and numerous other federal state and foreign governmental authority these authority and member of congress have been increasing their scrutiny of our industry in addition certain state government and the federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interaction with health care provider result we are required by law to disclose payment and other transfer of value to health care provider licensed by certain state and starting with payment or other transfer of value made on or after august to all physician and teaching hospital at the federal level any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirement could impact our business in addition we may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resource to further develop and implement policy system and process to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirement which may also impact our business we anticipate that governmental authority will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost exposure to litigation and other adverse effect to our operation we are subject to costly and complex and foreign law and governmental regulation and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operation our medical device are subject to regulation by numerous and foreign government agency including the fda and comparable agency outside the to varying degree each of these agency requires to comply with law and regulation of contentsgoverning the development testing manufacturing labeling marketing and distribution of our product we can not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing clearance for our new product or enhancement or modification to existing product and the failure to maintain approval or obtain approval or clearance could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow even if we are able to obtain such approval or clearance it may take significant amount of time require the expenditure of substantial resource involve stringent clinical and pre clinical testing well increased post market surveillance involve modification repair or replacement of our product and result in limitation on the proposed us of our product both before and after product is commercially released we have ongoing responsibility under fda regulation many of our facility and procedure and those of our supplier are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda to determine compliance with the fda requirement including primarily the quality system regulation and medical device reporting regulation the result of these inspection can include inspectional observation on fda form warning letter or other form of enforcement since the fda ha significantly increased it oversight of company subject to it regulation including medical device company by hiring new investigator and stepping inspection of manufacturing facility the fda ha recently also significantly increased the number of warning letter issued to company if the fda were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law or regulation or that any of our medical device are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk the fda could ban such medical device detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical device order recall repair replacement or refund of such device refuse to grant pending pre market approval application or require certificate of foreign government for export and or require to notify health professional and others that the device present unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health the fda may also ass civil or criminal penalty against our officer or employee and impose operating restriction on company wide basis or enjoin and or restrain certain conduct resulting in violation of applicable law the fda may also recommend prosecution to the doj any adverse regulatory action depending on it magnitude may restrict from effectively marketing and selling our product and limit our ability to obtain future pre market clearance or approval and could result in substantial modification to our business practice and operation in addition device manufacturer are permitted to promote product solely for the us and indication set forth in the approved product labeling number of enforcement action have been taken against manufacturer that promote product for

therapy are purchased principally by hospital or physician that typically bill various third party payors such governmental program medicare medicaid and comparable foreign program private insurance plan and managed care plan for the healthcare service provided to their patient the ability of our customer to obtain appropriate reimbursement for product and service from third party payors is critical because it affect which product customer purchase and the price they are willing to pay result our device product and therapy are subject to regulation regarding quality and cost by hhs including the center for medicare medicaid service cm well comparable state and non agency responsible for reimbursement and regulation of health care good and service the principal federal law

program and policy and change in and foreign legal regulatory requirement implementation of further legislative or administrative reform to the reimbursement system in the and abroad or adverse decision relating to our product by administrator of these system in coverage or reimbursement could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our product and the price that our customer are willing to pay for them the law and regulation of health care good and service that are applicable to including those described above are subject to evolving interpretation if governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable law and regulation we and our officer and employee could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalty including for example exclusion from participation supplier of product to beneficiary covered by cm any failure to comply with law and regulation relating to reimbursement and health care good and service could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition and cash flow of contentswe are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and failing to protect such right or to be successful in litigation related to our right or the right of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and other proprietary right against others we are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary right and rely on combination of patent trade secret and non disclosure and non competition agreement to protect our proprietary intellectual property we also operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation patent litigation against can result in significant damage award and injunction that could prevent our manufacture and sale of affected product or require to pay significant royalty in order to continue to manufacture or sell affected product at any given time we are generally involved both plaintiff and defendant in number of patent infringement action the outcome of which may not be known for prolonged period of time while it is not possible to predict the outcome of patent litigation we believe the result associated with any such litigation could result in our payment of significant monetary damage and or royalty payment negatively impact our ability to sell current or future product or prohibit from enforcing our patent and proprietary right against others which would generally have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow while we intend to defend against any threat to our intellectual property our patent trade secret or other agreement may not adequately protect our intellectual property further pending patent application owned by may not result in patent being issued to patent issued to or licensed by in the past or in the future may be challenged or circumvented by competitor and such patent may be found invalid unenforceable or insufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide with any competitive advantage third party could obtain patent that may require to negotiate license to conduct our business and the required license may not be available on reasonable term or at all we also rely on non disclosure and non competition agreement with certain employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right we can not be certain that these agreement will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third party will not otherwise gain access to our trade secret or proprietary knowledge in addition the law of certain country in which we market some of our product do not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law of the which could make it easier for competitor to capture market position in such country by utilizing technology that are similar to those developed or licensed by competitor also may harm our sale by designing product that mirror the capability of our product or technology without infringing our intellectual property right if we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these country it could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operation quality problem with and product liability claim in connection with our process good and service could lead to recall or safety alert harm our reputation and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and our cash flow quality is extremely important to and our customer due to the serious and costly consequence of product failure and our business expose to potential product liability risk that are inherent in the design manufacture and marketing of medical device in addition many of our product are often used in intensive care setting with seriously ill patient and some of the medical device we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long period of time or indefinitely component failure manufacturing defect design flaw off label use or inadequate disclosure of product related risk or product related information with respect to our product could result in an unsafe condition or injury to or death of patient these problem could lead to recall of or issuance of safety alert relating to our product and could result in product liability claim and lawsuit including class action which could ultimately result in certain case in the removal from the body of such product and claim regarding cost associated therewith due to the strong name recognition of the medtronic and covidien brand material adverse event involving one of our product could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all product within that brand and could harm our reputation and ability to market product in the future in addition our quality certification are critical to the marketing success of our good and service if we fail to meet these standard and our product are the subject of recall or safety alert our reputation could be damaged we could lose customer and our revenue and result of operation could decline our success also depends generally on our ability to manufacture to exact tolerance precision engineered component subassemblies and finished device from multiple material if our component fail to meet these standard or fail to adapt to evolving standard our reputation competitive advantage and market share could be harmed in certain situation we also may undertake voluntary recall of product or temporarily shut production line based on performance relative to our own internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data further we have elected to self insure with respect to product liability risk and any product liability claim brought against with or without merit could be costly to defend see our self insurance program may not be adequate to cover future loss any of the foregoing problem including product liability claim or product recall in the future regardless of their ultimate of contentsoutcome could harm our reputation and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow health care policy change including health care reform legislation signed in may have material adverse effect on in response to perceived increase in health care cost in recent year there have been and continue to be proposal by the federal government state government regulator and third party payer to control these cost and more generally to reform the health care system certain of these proposal could limit the price we are able to charge for our product or the amount of reimbursement available for our product and could limit the acceptance and availability of our product the adoption of some or all of these proposal could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation in march president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act of certain provision of the law will not be effective for number of year and there are many program and requirement for which the detail have not yet been fully established or consequence not fully understood and it is unclear the full impact will be from the law the legislation imposes significant new tax on medical device maker in the form of percent excise tax on all medical device sale that commenced in january under the legislation the total cost to the medical device industry is expected to be approximately billion over year the law also focus on number of medicare provision aimed at improving quality and decreasing cost it is uncertain at this point what negative unintended consequence these provision will have on patient access to new technology the medicare provision include value based payment program increased funding of comparative effectiveness research reduced hospital payment for avoidable readmission and hospital acquired condition and pilot program to evaluate alternative payment methodology that promote care coordination such bundled physician and hospital payment additionally the law includes reduction in the annual rate of inflation for medicare payment to hospital that began in and the establishment of an independent payment advisory board to recommend way of reducing the rate of growth in medicare spending we can not predict what health care program and regulation will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation however any change that lower reimbursement for our product or reduce medical procedure volume could adversely affect our business and result of operation our self insurance program may not be adequate to cover future loss we have elected to self insure most of our insurable risk we made this decision based on condition in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher level of self insurance retention increasing number of coverage limitation and dramatically higher insurance premium rate we maintain director and officer policy providing limited coverage and continue to monitor the insurance marketplace to evaluate the value to of obtaining insurance coverage for other category of loss in the future while based on historical loss trend we believe that our self insurance program accrual and our existing insurance coverage will be adequate to cover future loss we can not guarantee that this will remain true historical trend may not be indicative of future loss the fact that we do not maintain third party insurance coverage for all category of loss increase our exposure to unanticipated claim and these loss could have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow if we experience decreasing price for our good and service and we are unable to reduce our expense our result of operation will suffer we may experience decreasing price for our good and service due to pricing pressure experienced by our customer from managed care organization and other third party payer increased market power of our customer the medical device industry consolidates and increased competition among medical engineering and manufacturing service provider if the price for our good and service decrease and we are unable to reduce our expense our result of operation will be adversely affected we may experience higher cost to produce our product result of change in price for oil gas and other commodity we use resin other petroleum based material and pulp raw material in some of our product price of oil and gas also significantly affect our cost for freight and utility oil gas and pulp price are volatile and may increase resulting in higher cost to produce and distribute our product new law or regulation adopted in response to climate change could also increase energy cost and the cost of certain raw material and component due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment effort of our customer and third party payer we may be unable to pas along cost increase through higher price if we are unable to fully recover these cost through price increase or offset these increase through cost reduction we could experience lower margin and profitability and our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected of contentscontinuing worldwide economic instability could adversely affect our revenue financial condition or result of operation since fiscal year the global economy ha been impacted by the sequential effect of an ongoing global financial crisis this global financial crisis continues to cause disruption in the financial market including diminished liquidity and credit availability during certain period there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy our customer and vendor may experience financial difficulty or be unable to borrow money to fund their operation which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our product or to pay for our product on timely basis if at all with our customer and vendor these economic condition make it more difficult for to accurately forecast and plan our future business activity in addition significant amount of our trade receivables are with national health care system in many country repayment of these receivables is dependent upon the financial stability of the economy of those country in light of these global economic fluctuation we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of customer located outside the failure to receive payment of all or significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our result of operation we are subject to variety of market and financial risk due to our international operation that could adversely affect those operation or our profitability and operating result operation in country outside of the accounting for approximately percent of our net sale for the fiscal year ended april are accompanied by certain financial and other risk we intend to continue to pursue growth opportunity in sale outside the especially in emerging market which could expose to greater risk associated with international sale and operation our profitability and international operation are and will continue to be subject to number of risk and potential cost including fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate healthcare reform legislation multiple non regulatory requirement that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our product local product preference and product requirement longer term receivables than are typical in the trade protection measure and import or export licensing requirement le intellectual property protection in some country outside the than exists in the different labor regulation and workforce instability political and economic instability the potential payment of income tax on earnings of certain controlled foreign subsidiary subject to taxation upon repatriation the expiration and non renewal of foreign tax ruling and or grant potentially negative consequence from change in or interpretation of tax law and economic instability and inflation recession or interest rate fluctuation in particular the obama administration ha announced potential legislative proposal to tax profit of company earned abroad while it is impossible for to predict whether these and other proposal will be implemented or how they will ultimately impact they may materially impact our result of operation if for example our profit earned abroad are subject to income tax or we are otherwise disallowed deduction result of these profit finally change in foreign currency exchange rate may reduce the reported value of our foreign currency revenue net of expense and cash flow we can not predict change in currency exchange rate the impact of exchange rate change nor the degree to which we will be able to manage the impact of currency exchange rate change the failure to comply with foreign corrupt practice act and similar worldwide anti bribery law in non jurisdiction could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and or criminal sanction the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and similar worldwide anti bribery law in non jurisdiction generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment to non government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business because of the predominance of government sponsored healthcare system around the world most of our customer relationship outside of the are with governmental entity and are therefore potentially subject to such anti bribery law global enforcement of anti corruption law ha increased substantially in recent year with more frequent voluntary self disclosure by company aggressive investigation and enforcement proceeding by and foreign governmental agency and assessment of significant fine and penalty against company and individual our international operation create the risk of unauthorized payment or offer of payment by one of our employee consultant sale agent or distributor because these party are not always subject to our control it is our policy to implement safeguard to educate our employee and agent on of contentsthese legal requirement and discourage improper practice however our existing safeguard and any future improvement may prove to be le than effective and our employee consultant sale agent or distributor may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible in addition the government may seek to hold liable for successor liability fcpa violation committed by any company in which we invest or that we acquire any alleged or actual violation of these regulation may subject to government scrutiny severe criminal or civil sanction and other liability including exclusion from government contracting and could disrupt our business and result in material adverse effect on our reputation result of operation financial condition and cash flow law and regulation governing the export of our product could adversely impact our business the department of the treasury office of foreign asset control ofac and the bureau of industry and security at the department of commerce bi administer certain law and regulation that restrict person and in some instance non person in conducting activity transacting business with or making investment in certain country government entity and individual subject to economic sanction due to our international operation we are subject to such law and regulation which are complex restrict our business dealing with certain country and individual and are constantly changing further restriction may be enacted amended enforced or interpreted in manner that materially impact our operation from time to time certain of our subsidiary have limited business dealing in country subject to comprehensive sanction including iran sudan syria cuba and those in the region of crimea certain of our subsidiary sell medical device and surgical tool and may provide related service to distributor and other purchasing body in such country these business dealing represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenue and income but expose to heightened risk of violating applicable sanction regulation violation of these regulation are punishable by civil penalty including fine denial of export privilege injunction asset seizure debarment from government contract and revocation or restriction of license well criminal fine and imprisonment we have established policy and procedure designed to assist with our compliance with such law and regulation however there can be no assurance that our policy and procedure will effectively prevent from violating these regulation in every transaction in which we may engage and such violation could adversely affect our reputation business financial condition result of operation and cash flow consolidation in the health care industry could have an adverse effect on our revenue and result of operation many health care industry company including health care system are consolidating to create new company with greater market power the health care industry consolidates competition to provide good and service to industry participant will become more intense these industry participant may try to use their market power to negotiate price concession or reduction for medical device that incorporate component produced by if we are forced to reduce our price because of consolidation in the health care industry our revenue would decrease and our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow would suffer our business is indirectly subject to health care industry cost containment measure that could result in reduced sale of medical device and medical device containing our component most of our customer and the health care provider to our customer supply medical device rely on third party payer including government program and private health insurance plan to reimburse some or all of the cost of the procedure in which medical device that incorporate component we manufacture or assemble are used the continuing effort of governmental authority insurance company and other payer of health care cost to contain or reduce these cost could lead to patient being unable to obtain approval for payment from these third party payer if third party payer payment approval can not be obtained by patient sale of finished medical device that include our component may decline significantly and our customer may reduce or eliminate purchase of our component the cost containment measure that health care provider are instituting both in the and internationally could harm our ability to operate profitably for example managed care organization have successfully negotiated volume discount for pharmaceutical in an effort to reduce cost many existing and potential customer for our product within the have become member of group purchase organization gpo and integrated delivery network idns gpo and idns negotiate pricing arrangement with healthcare product manufacturer and distributor and offer the negotiated price to affiliated hospital and other member gpo and idns typically award contract on category by category basis through competitive bidding process bid are generally solicited from multiple manufacturer with the intention of driving down pricing due to the highly competitive nature of the gpo and idn contracting process we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract position with major gpo and idns across our product portfolio furthermore the increasing leverage of organized buying group may reduce market price for our product thereby reducing our profitability while contract with gpo and idn for given product category can facilitate sale to member of that gpo or idn such contract position can offer no assurance that sale volume of those product will be maintained gpo and idns increasingly are awarding contract to multiple supplier for the same product category even when we are the sole contracted supplier of of contentsgpo or idn for certain product category member of the gpo or idn generally are free to purchase from other supplier furthermore gpo and idn contract typically are terminable without cause upon to day notice accordingly although we have multiple contract with many major gpo and idns the member of such group may choose to purchase from our competitor due to the price or quality offered by such competitor which could result in decline in our sale and profitability our research and development effort rely upon investment and investment collaboration and we can not guarantee that any previous or future investment or investment collaboration will be successful our strategy to provide broad range of therapy to restore patient to fuller healthier life requires wide variety of technology product and capability the rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different area of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop broad portfolio of technological solution in addition to internally generated growth through our research and development effort historically we have relied and expect to continue to rely upon investment and investment collaboration to provide access to new technology both in area served by our existing business well in new area we expect to make future investment where we believe that we can stimulate the development or acquisition of new technology and product to further our strategic objective and strengthen our existing business investment and investment collaboration in and with medical technology company are inherently risky and we can not guarantee that any of our previous or future investment or investment collaboration will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow the continuing development of many of our product depends upon maintaining strong relationship with health care professional if we fail to maintain our working relationship with health care professional many of our product may not be developed and marketed in line with the need and expectation of the professional who use and support our product which could cause decline in our earnings and profitability the research development marketing and sale of many of our new and improved product is dependent upon our maintaining working relationship with health care professional we rely on these professional to provide with considerable knowledge and experience regarding the development marketing and sale of our product physician assist researcher marketing and product consultant inventor and public speaker if we are unable to maintain our strong relationship with these professional and continue to receive their advice and input the development and marketing of our product could suffer which could have material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings financial condition and or cash flow we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology system to operate our business and if we fail to properly maintain the integrity of our data or if our product do not operate intended or we experience cyber attack or other breach of these system our business could be materially affected we are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our product and infrastructure we rely on

significant resource to maintain protect and enhance existing system and develop new system to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology evolving system and regulatory standard the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer pattern result of technology initiative recently enacted regulation change in our system platform and integration of new business acquisition we have been consolidating and integrating the number of system we operate and have upgraded and expanded our information system capability in addition third party may attempt to hack into our product or system and may obtain data relating to patient with our product or the company proprietary information if we fail to maintain or protect our information

past several year have included period of significant economic uncertainty and at time general market distress especially in the banking and financial service sector during these period of economic uncertainty we may experience reduced liquidity across the fixed income investment market including the security in which we invest in the event we need to sell these security we may not be able to do so in timely manner or for value that is equal to the underlying principal in addition we may be required to adjust the carrying value of the security and record an impairment charge if we determine that the fair value of such security is temporarily impaired we would record temporary impairment component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholder equity if it is determined that the fair value of these security is other than temporarily impaired we would record loss in our consolidated statement of earnings which could materially adversely impact our result of operation and

integrate acquired business into our operation successfully could adversely affect our business part of our strategy to develop and identify new product and technology we have made several acquisition in recent year including the recent acquisition of covidien and may make additional acquisition in the future our integration of the operation of acquired business requires significant effort including the coordination of information technology research and development sale and marketing operation manufacturing and finance these effort result in additional expense and involve significant amount of management time that can not then be dedicated to other project our failure to manage and coordinate the growth of the combined company successfully could also have an adverse impact on our business in addition we can not be certain that the business we acquire will become profitable or remain so factor that will affect the success of our acquisition include the presence or absence of adequate internal control and or significant fraud in the financial system of acquired company adverse development arising of investigation by governmental entity of the business practice of acquired

these investigation and respond to such request however when an investigation begin we can not predict when it will be resolved the outcome of the investigation or it impact on an adverse outcome in one or more of these investigation could include the commencement of civil and or criminal proceeding substantial fine penalty and or administrative remedy including exclusion from government reimbursement program entry into corporate integrity agreement cia with governmental agency and amendment to existing cia in addition resolution of any of these matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligation finally if these investigation continue over long period of time they could divert the attention of management from the day to day operation of our business and impose significant administrative burden including cost on these potential consequence well any adverse outcome from these investigation or other investigation initiated by the government at any time could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation our substantial leverage and debt service obligation could adversely affect our business of april our total consolidated external debt wa approximately billion we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future our substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequence including making it more difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic regulatory and industry condition and placing at disadvantage compared to our competitor that are le leveraged limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and the industry in which we operate limiting our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate or other purpose and exposing to greater interest rate risk our debt service obligation will require to use portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal in indebtedness instead of for other corporate purpose including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditure which could impede our growth our ability to make payment on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund capital expenditure will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future this is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factor many of which are beyond our control change in tax law or exposure to additional income tax liability could have material impact

were to default in it obligation to another party to pay it share of the distribution tax that arise result of no party fault each non defaulting party would be required to pay equally with any other non defaulting party the amount in default in addition if another party to the tax sharing agreement that is responsible for all or portion of an income tax liability were to default in it payment of such liability to taxing authority covidien could be legally liable under applicable tax law for such liability and be required to make additional tax payment accordingly under certain circumstance covidien may be obligated to pay amount in excess of the agreed upon share of covidien tyco international and te connectivity tax liability on september tyco international spun off two of it business to it shareholder with tyco international remaining publicly traded company this could have material adverse impact on tyco international ability to fulfill it obligation to under the tax sharing agreement in addition the irs ha concluded it field examination of certain of tyco international federal income tax return for the year through and proposed tax adjustment several of which also affect covidien income tax return for year after tyco international ha appealed certain of the tax adjustment proposed by the irs and ha resolved all but one of the matter associated with the proposed tax adjustment with respect to the outstanding issue that remains in dispute on june tyco international advised covidien that it had received notice of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of tyco international former subsidiary owe additional tax of million plus penalty of million based on audit of the through tax year of tyco international and it subsidiary they existed at that time these amount exclude interest and do not reflect the impact on subsequent period if the position taken by the irs is ultimately proved correct the irs ha asserted in the notice of deficiency that substantially all of tyco international intercompany debt originating during the year through should not be treated debt for federal income tax purpose and ha disallowed interest deduction related to the intercompany debt and certain tax attribute adjustment recognized on tyco international income tax return totaling approximately billion on july tyco international filed petition with the tax court contesting the irs assessment the outcome of any such litigation is uncertain and could result in significant increase in liability for tax arising during these period in particular if the irs is successful in asserting it claim it would likely assert that approximately billion of interest deduction with respect to tyco international intercompany debt in subsequent time period should also be disallowed the company ha provided reserve for potential payment of tax to various tax authority related to uncertain tax position however the calculation of such tax liability involves the application of complex tax regulation in many jurisdiction therefore of contentsany dispute with tax authority may result in payment that is significantly different from current estimate if payment of these amount ultimately prof to be le than the recorded amount the reversal of the liability generally would result in tax benefit being recognized in the period when we determine the liability are no longer necessary if the company estimate of tax liability prof to be le than the amount for which it is ultimately liable we would incur additional charge to expense and such charge could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow if the distribution of mallinckrodt ordinary share to covidien shareholder in the distribution of covidien

tax free under section and of the code the private letter ruling also provided that certain internal transaction undertaken in anticipation of the separation from tyco international qualify for favorable treatment under the code in addition to obtaining the private letter ruling tyco international obtained tax opinion from the law firm of mcdermott will emery llp confirming the tax free status of the distribution and certain internal transaction the private letter ruling and the opinion relied on certain fact and assumption and certain representation and undertaking in the case of the separation from covidien and mallinckrodt and in the case of the separation from covidien te connectivity and tyco international regarding the past and future conduct of their respective business and other matter notwithstanding the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine on audit that the distribution or the distribution or the related internal transaction should be treated taxable transaction if it determines that any of the respective fact assumption representation or undertaking is not correct or ha been violated or that the distribution should be taxable for other reason including result of significant change in stock or asset ownership after the distribution or if the irs were to disagree with the conclusion of the tax opinion that are not covered by the

ireland and other country in which we and our affiliate do business could change on prospective or retroactive basis and any such change could materially adversely affect our business moreover and foreign tax authority may carefully scrutinize company that result from cross border business combination such which may lead such authority to assert that we owe additional tax which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and cash flow of contentsrisks relating to our jurisdiction of incorporationirish law differs from the law in effect in the and may afford le protection to holder of our security it may not be possible to enforce court judgment obtained in the against in ireland based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law in addition there is some uncertainty to whether the court of ireland would recognize or enforce judgment of court obtained against or our director or officer based on the civil liability provision of the federal or state security law or hear action against or those person based on those law we have been advised that the currently doe not have treaty with ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgment in civil and commercial matter therefore final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court based on civil liability whether or not based solely on federal or state security law would not automatically be enforceable in ireland an irish company we are governed by the irish company act which differ in some material respect from law generally applicable to corporation and shareholder including among others difference relating to interested director and officer transaction and shareholder lawsuit likewise the duty of director and officer of an irish company generally are owed to the company only shareholder of irish company generally do not have personal right of action against director or officer of

be subject to irish stamp duty transfer of our share effected by mean of the transfer of book entry interest in the depository trust company dtc will not be subject to irish stamp duty however if you hold our share directly rather than beneficially through dtc any transfer of your share could be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of of the higher of the price paid or the market value of the share acquired payment of irish stamp duty is generally legal obligation of the transferee the potential for stamp duty could adversely affect the price of your share in certain limited

relevant information to qualifying intermediary appointed by however other shareholder may be subject to dividend withholding tax which could adversely affect the price of their share shareholder entitled to an exemption from irish dividend withholding tax on dividend received from will not be subject to irish income tax in respect of those dividend unless they have some connection with ireland other than their shareholding in our company for example they are resident in ireland shareholder who receive dividend subject to irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to irish income tax on those dividend our share received by mean of gift or inheritance could be subject to irish capital acquisition tax irish capital acquisition tax cat could apply to gift or inheritance of our share irrespective of the place of residence ordinary residence or domicile of the party this is because our share will be regarded property situated in ireland the person who receives the gift or inheritance ha primary liability for cat gift and inheritance passing between spouse are exempt from cat child have tax free threshold of in respect of taxable gift or inheritance received from their parent risk relating to the covidien acquisition the transaction we may not realize all of the anticipated benefit of the transaction or those benefit may take longer to realize than expected we may also encounter significant unexpected difficulty in integrating medtronic inc and covidien our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction will depend to large extent on our ability to integrate the medtronic inc and covidien business the combination of two independent business is complex costly and time consuming process result we will be required to devote significant management attention and resource to integrating the business practice and operation of medtronic inc and covidien the integration process may disrupt the business and if implemented of contentsineffectively or if impacted by unforeseen negative economic or market condition or other factor we may not realize the full anticipated benefit of the transaction our failure to meet the challenge involved in integrating the two business to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction could cause an interruption or loss of momentum in our activity and could adversely affect our result of operation in addition the overall integration of the business may result in material unanticipated problem expense liability competitive response loss of customer relationship and diversion of management attention the difficulty of combining the operation of the company include among others the diversion of management attention to integration matter difficulty in achieving anticipated cost saving synergy business opportunity and growth prospect from combining the business difficulty in the integration of operation and system difficulty in the assimilation of employee difficulty in managing the expanded operation of significantly larger and more complex company challenge in keeping existing customer and obtaining new customer and challenge in attracting and retaining key personnel many of these factor will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased cost decrease in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact our business financial condition and result of operation in addition even if the operation of the business of medtronic inc and covidien are integrated successfully we may not realize the full benefit of the transaction including the synergy cost saving or sale or growth opportunity that we expect these benefit may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all furthermore additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the integration of the business of medtronic inc and covidien all of these factor could negatively impact our earnings per share decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the transaction and negatively impact the price of our ordinary share result we can not assure you that the combination of the medtronic inc and covidien business will result in the realization of the full benefit anticipated from the transaction future potential change to the tax law could result in being treated corporation for federal tax purpose and the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated foreign corporation for federal income tax purpose because we are an irish incorporated entity we would generally be classified foreign corporation under the general rule that corporation is considered tax resident in the jurisdiction of it organization or incorporation for federal income tax purpose even so the irs may assert that we should be treated corporation and therefore tax resident for federal income tax purpose pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of amended the code under section of the code if medtronic inc shareholder immediately prior to the transaction hold or more of the vote or value of our share by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc immediately after the transaction the ownership test and our expanded affiliated group after the transaction doe not have substantial business activity in ireland relative to it worldwide activity the substantial business activity test we would be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose based on the rule for determining share ownership under section of the code medtronic inc shareholder received approximately of our ordinary share by both vote and value by reason of holding stock in medtronic inc therefore under current law we should not be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose however there is limited guidance regarding the application of section including the application of the ownership test in addition change to section or the treasury regulation promulgated thereunder could affect our status foreign corporation for federal tax purpose any such change could have prospective or retroactive application since section wa enacted there have been various legislative proposal to broaden it scope such proposal could among other thing treat foreign acquiring corporation corporation under section if the former shareholder of the corporation own more than of the share of the foreign acquiring corporation after the transaction or if the foreign corporation affiliated group ha substantial business activity in the and the foreign corporation is primarily managed and controlled in the accordingly if enacted in their present form and retroactively effective to apply to the transaction such proposal could cause to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose if we were to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose based on our existing expected cash flow we could be subject to substantially greater tax liability than currently contemplated non corporation specifically if we were to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose we would be subject to corporate income tax on our worldwide income and the income of our foreign subsidiary would be subject to tax when repatriated or when deemed recognized under the tax rule for controlled foreign corporation cfc additionally covidien foreign of contentscorporations which are not currently cfc would become cfc making them potentially subject to current or future taxation which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow the treasury department and the irs may promulgate rule that would adversely affect our tax position the treasury department ha announced that it is examining possible change in the regulatory rule affecting company that move their tax domicile outside the in the event the treasury department and the irs were to change the applicable regulatory rule we could face potentially substantial tax cost result of the transaction we are unable to ass the potential impact of any such possible change if adopted until they are announced on september the treasury department and the irs issued new guidance announcing their intention to issue regulation interpreting multiple section of the code including section to address inversion transaction and transaction that treasury and the irs characterize post inversion tax avoidance transaction the irs notice when issued such regulation would apply to transaction completed on or after september the regulation described in the irs notice would expand the set of circumstance under which section applies to cause the foreign acquirer of corporation to be treated corporation for federal income tax purpose such regulation would also impose additional tax on certain transaction involving the acquired corporation cfc the regulation interpreting section of the code announced in the irs notice are not expected to cause to be treated corporation for federal tax purpose however if ultimately upheld by reviewing court the regulation announced in the irs notice would be expected to limit our ability to engage in various intercompany transaction involving non subsidiary in addition in the irs notice the treasury department and the irs announced their intention to issue additional guidance in the future intended to restrict our ability to undertake certain transaction which could reduce our tax liability according to the irs notice such guidance may include among other thing limitation on our ability to deduct interest on certain intercompany debt for federal income tax purpose we are unable to predict the likelihood that any such guidance will be issued the nature of regulation that may be promulgated thereunder or the effect such guidance may have on our business the transaction may not allow to maintain competitive global cash management and low effective corporate tax rate while we believe that being incorporated in ireland should help maintain competitive worldwide effective corporate tax rate and provide flexible global cash management we can not give any assurance to what our effective tax rate will be however because of among other thing uncertainty regarding the tax policy of the jurisdiction where we will operate additionally the tax law of ireland and other jurisdiction could change in the future and such change could cause material change in our effective tax rate legislative or other governmental action relating to the denial of federal or state governmental contract to company that redomicile abroad could adversely affect our business various federal and state legislative proposal that would deny governmental contract to company that move their corporate location abroad may affect we are unable to predict the likelihood that or final form in which any such proposed legislation might become law the nature of the regulation that may be promulgated under any future legislative enactment or the

covidien we reevaluated the judgment used by management of the company in making estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount for revenue expense asset and liability related to revenue recognition based upon the lag time between the original sale to distributor at list price and the related distributor rebate claim earned at time of sale to the end customer and the judgment involved

other class action income tax matter and environmental matter the outcome of these legal action are not within our complete control and may not be known for prolonged period of time in some action the claimant seek damage well other relief including injunction barring the sale of product that are the subject of the lawsuit that could require significant expenditure or result in lost revenue estimate of probable loss resulting from litigation governmental proceeding and income tax matter involving the company are inherently difficult to predict particularly when the matter are in early procedural stage with incomplete scientific fact or legal discovery involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claim for damage potentially involve penalty fine or punitive damage or could result in change in business practice our significant legal proceeding are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement in item financial statement and supplementary data in this annual report on form while it is not possible to predict the outcome for most of the matter discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement we believe it is possible that cost associated with them could have material adverse impact on our consolidated earnings financial position or cash flow of contentsincome tax our effective tax rate is based on income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate we establish reserve when despite our belief that our tax return position are fully supportable we believe that certain position are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail these reserve are established and adjusted in accordance with the principle of gaap under gaap if we determine that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the position we recognize the benefit we measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement we presume that all tax position will be examined by taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction across our global operation we regularly monitor our tax position and tax liability we reevaluate the technical merit of our tax position and recognize an uncertain tax benefit or derecognize previously recorded tax benefit when there is completion of tax audit ii there is change in applicable tax law including tax case or legislative guidance or iii there is an expiration of the statute of limitation significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserve although we believe that we have adequately provided for liability resulting from tax assessment by taxing authority position taken by these tax authority could have material impact on our effective tax rate consolidated earnings financial position or cash flow in the event there is non gaap adjustment recognized in our operating result the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by these discrete item that take place in the period we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non gaap nominal tax rate the non gaap nominal tax rate is defined the income tax provision percentage of income before income tax excluding non gaap adjustment we believe this resulting non gaap financial measure provides useful information to investor because it excludes the effect of these discrete item so that investor can compare our recurring result over multiple period investor should consider this non gaap measure in addition to and not substitute for financial performance measure prepared in accordance with gaap in addition this non gaap financial measure may not be the same or similar to measure presented by other company tax regulation require certain item to be included in the tax return at different time than when those item are required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statement result our effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statement is different than that reported in our tax return some of these difference are permanent such expense that are not deductible on our tax return and some are temporary difference such depreciation expense temporary difference create deferred tax asset and liability deferred tax asset generally represent item that can be used tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future year for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our consolidated statement of income we establish valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liability generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statement for which payment ha been deferred or expense ha already been taken deduction on our tax return but ha not yet been recognized an expense in our consolidated statement of income the company overall tax rate from continuing operation including the tax impact of non gaap adjustment resulted in an effective tax rate of percent for fiscal year excluding the impact of the non gaap adjustment our operational and tax strategy have resulted in non gaap nominal tax rate of percent versus the federal statutory rate of percent an

becomes an amortizable asset ipr represents the fair value of those research and development project for which the related product have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use determining the fair value of ipr requires the company to make significant estimate the fair value of ipr is determined by estimating the future cash flow of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flow back to their present value the discount rate used is determined at the time of measurement in accordance with accepted valuation methodology at the time of acquisition the company expects that all acquired ipr will reach technological feasibility but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability of these product will actually be achieved the nature of the

accordance with accepted valuation methodology the fair value of the contingent consideration is remeasured each reporting period with the change in fair value including accretion for the passage of time recognized income or expense within acquisition related item in the consolidated statement of income change in the fair value will impact the company earnings in such reporting period thereby resulting in potential variability in the company earnings until contingency are resolved derivative gaap requires company to recognize all derivative asset and liability on the balance sheet and to measure the instrument at fair value through earnings unless the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting if the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting depending on the nature of the hedge and hedge effectiveness change in the fair value of the derivative will either be recognized immediately in earnings or recorded in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings upon settlement termination the change in the fair value of the derivative are intended to offset the change in fair value of the hedged asset liability or probable commitment the company

company ha collateral credit agreement with it primary derivative counterparties under these agreement either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transaction covered by the agreement exceeds specific threshold thus limiting credit exposure for both party fair value measurement the company follows the authoritative guidance on fair value measurement and disclosure with respect to asset and liability that are measured at fair value on both recurring and nonrecurring basis under this guidance fair value is defined the exit price or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date the authoritative guidance also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the categorization of financial asset and financial liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the hierarchy is broken down into three level defined follows level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input are unobservable for the asset or liability financial asset that are classified level security include highly liquid government bond within government and agency security marketable equity security and exchange traded fund for which quoted market price are available in addition the company classifies foreign currency forward contract level since they are valued using quoted market price in active market which have identical asset or liability the valuation for most fixed maturity security are classified level financial asset that are classified level include corporate debt security government and agency security foreign government and agency security certificate of deposit other asset backed security debt fund and certain mortgage backed security whose value is determined using input that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data such pricing for similar security recently executed transaction cash flow model with yield curve and benchmark security in addition interest rate swap are included in level the company us input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset the level derivative instrument are primarily valued using standard calculation and model that use readily observable market data their basis financial asset are considered level when their fair value are determined using pricing model discounted cash flow methodology or similar technique and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable level financial asset also include certain investment security for which there is limited market activity such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation level investment security include certain corporate debt security auction rate security and certain mortgage backed security with the exception of auction rate security these security were valued using third party pricing source that incorporate transaction detail such contractual term maturity timing and amount of expected future cash flow well assumption about liquidity and credit valuation adjustment by market participant the fair value of auction rate security is estimated by the company using discounted cash flow model which incorporates significant unobservable input the significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the company auction rate security are year to principal recovery and the illiquidity premium that is incorporated into the discount rate significant increase decrease in any of those input in isolation would result in significantly lower higher fair value of the security warranty obligation the company offer warranty on various product the company estimate the cost that may be incurred under it warranty and record liability in the amount of such cost at the time the product is sold the amount of the reserve recorded is equal to the net cost to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim the company includes the
