issuer that file electronically with the sec item risk factor exxonmobil financial and operating result are subject to variety of risk inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical business many of these risk factor are not within the company control and could adversely affect our business our financial and operating result or our financial condition these risk factor include supply and demand the oil gas and petrochemical business are fundamentally commodity business this mean exxonmobil operation and earnings may be significantly affected by change in oil gas and petrochemical price and by change in margin on refined product oil gas petrochemical and product price and margin in turn depend on local regional and global event or condition that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity any material decline in oil or natural gas price could have material adverse effect on certain of the company operation especially in the upstream segment financial condition and proved reserve on the other hand material increase in oil or natural gas price could have material adverse effect on certain of the company operation especially in the downstream and chemical segment economic condition the demand for energy and petrochemical is generally linked closely with broad based economic activity and level of prosperity the occurrence of recession or other period of low or negative economic growth will typically have direct adverse impact on our result other factor that affect general economic condition in the world or in major region such change in population growth rate period of civil unrest government austerity program or currency exchange rate fluctuation also impact the demand for energy and petrochemical sovereign debt downgrade default inability to access debt market due to credit or legal constraint liquidity crisis the breakup or restructuring of fiscal monetary or political system such the european union and other event or condition that impair the functioning of financial market and institution also pose risk to exxonmobil including risk to the safety of our financial asset and to the ability of our partner and customer to fulfill their commitment to exxonmobil other demand related factor other factor that may affect the demand for oil gas and petrochemical and therefore impact our result include technological improvement in energy efficiency seasonal weather pattern increased competitiveness of alternative energy source change in technology or consumer preference that alter fuel choice such technological advance in energy storage that make wind and solar competitive for power generation or increased consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric vehicle and broad based change in personal income level other supply related factor commodity price and margin also vary depending on number of factor affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply source and technology to enhance recovery from existing source tend to reduce commodity price to the extent such supply increase are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increase in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margin on the affected product world oil gas and petrochemical supply level can also be affected by factor that reduce available supply such adherence by country to opec production quota and other agreement among sovereign and the occurrence of war hostile action natural disaster disruption in competitor operation logistics constraint or unexpected unavailability of distribution channel that may disrupt supply technological change can also alter the relative cost for competitor to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemical other market factor exxonmobil business result are also exposed to potential negative impact due to change in interest rate inflation currency exchange rate and other local or regional market condition government and political factor exxonmobil result can be adversely affected by political or regulatory development affecting our operation access limitation number of country limit access to their oil and gas resource or may place resource limit from development altogether restriction on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in time of high commodity price national government may have le need of outside source of private capital many country also restrict the import or export of certain product based on point of origin restriction on business exxonmobil is subject to law and sanction imposed by the united state or by other jurisdiction we business that may prohibit exxonmobil or certain of it affiliate from doing business in certain country or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restriction may provide competitive advantage to competitor who may not be subject to comparable restriction lack of legal certainty country in which we do business lack well developed legal system or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory framework for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty expose our operation to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable action by government official and also make more difficult for to enforce our contract in some case these risk can be partially offset by agreement to arbitrate dispute in an international forum the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award regulatory and litigation risk even in country with well developed legal system where exxonmobil business we remain exposed to change in law or interpretation of settled law including change that result from international treaty and accord that could adversely affect our result such increase in tax duty or government royalty rate including retroactive claim price control change in environmental regulation or other law that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunity including change in law related to offshore drilling operation water use methane emission hydraulic fracturing or plastic adoption of regulation mandating efficiency standard the use of alternative fuel or uncompetitive fuel component adoption of government payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause to violate the non disclosure law of other country and government action to cancel contract denominate the official currency renounce or default on obligation renegotiate term unilaterally or expropriate asset legal remedy available to compensate for expropriation or other taking may be inadequate we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in country such the united state in which large and unpredictable punitive damage award may occur or by government enforcement proceeding alleging non compliance with applicable law or regulation security concern successful operation of particular facility or project may be disrupted by civil unrest act of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attack and other local security concern such concern may require to incur greater cost for security or to shut operation for period of time climate change and greenhouse gas restriction due to concern the risk of climate change number of country have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas emission these include adoption of cap and trade regime carbon tax minimum renewable usage requirement restrictive permitting increased efficiency standard and incentive or mandate for renewable energy such policy could make our product more expensive le competitive lengthen project implementation time and reduce demand for hydrocarbon well shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower carbon source such natural gas current and pending greenhouse gas regulation or policy may also increase our compliance cost such for monitoring or sequestering emission government sponsorship of alternative energy many government are providing tax advantage and other subsidy to support alternative energy source or are mandating the use of specific fuel or technology government and others are also promoting research into new technology to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy source we are conducting our research both in house and by working with more leading university around the world including the massachusetts institute of technology princeton university the university of texas and stanford university our research project focus on developing algae based biofuels carbon capture and storage breakthrough energy efficiency process advanced energy saving material and other technology for example exxonmobil is working with fuel cell energy inc to explore using carbonate fuel cell to economically capture emission from gas fired power plant our future result may depend in part on the success of our research effort and on our ability to adapt and apply the strength of our current business model to providing the energy product of the future in cost competitive manner see operational and other factor operational and other factor in addition to external economic and political factor our future business result also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factor that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factor will impact our performance relative to competition for project in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co venturer we do not control exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development effort among other factor we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospect and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resource on line scheduled and within budget project and portfolio management the long term success of exxonmobil upstream downstream and chemical business depends on complex long term capital intensive project these project in turn require high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factor that can affect the performance of major project include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturer partner government supplier customer or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop market for project output whether through long term contract or the development of effective spot market manage change in operating condition and cost including cost of third party equipment or service such drilling rig and shipping prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulty that could delay project startup or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operator where exxonmobil doe not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual project exxonmobil success including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive return to shareholder depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among type and location of our project the term project used in this report can refer to variety of different activity and doe not necessarily have the meaning in any government payment transparency report operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil competitive performance especially given the commodity based nature of many of our business is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expense and improve production yield on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvement cost control productivity enhancement regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employee research and development and technological change to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our business and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil research and development organization must be successful and able to adapt to changing market and policy environment including developing technology to help reduce greenhouse gas emission to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefit of new and emerging technology safety business control and environmental risk management our result depend on management ability to minimize the inherent risk of oil gas and petrochemical operation to control effectively our business activity and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management system and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spill or other adverse environmental event for example we work to minimize spill through combined program of effective operation integrity management ongoing upgrade key equipment replacement and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing cost effective new technology and adopting new operating practice to reduce air emission not in response to government requirement but also to address community priority we also maintain disciplined framework of internal control and apply control management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liability and other adverse impact could result if our management system and control do not function intended cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruption from variety of threat actor including state sponsored actor exxonmobil defensive preparedness includes multi layered technological capability for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruption non technological measure such threat information sharing with governmental and industry group internal training and awareness campaign including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery if the measure we are taking to protect cybersecurity disruption prove to be insufficient exxonmobil well our customer employee or third party could be adversely affected cybersecurity disruption could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy asset compromise business system result in proprietary information altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or third party information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operation we could incur significant cost to remedy the effect of major cybersecurity disruption in addition to cost in connection with resulting regulatory action litigation or reputational harm preparedness our operation may be disrupted by severe weather event natural disaster human error and similar event for example hurricane may damage our offshore production facility or coastal refining and petrochemical plant in vulnerable area our facility are designed constructed and operated to withstand variety of extreme climatic and other condition with safety factor built in to cover number of engineering uncertainty including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow pattern permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extreme extreme rainfall event and earthquake our consideration of changing weather condition and inclusion of safety factor in design cover the engineering uncertainty that climate change and other event may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these event depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering well our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning insurance limitation the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risk it face described in this item is limited by the capacity of the applicable insurance market which may not be sufficient competition noted in item the energy and petrochemical industry are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firm but also from state owned company that are increasingly competing for opportunity outside of their home country in some case these state owned company may pursue opportunity in furtherance of strategic objective of their government owner with le focus on financial return than company owned by private shareholder such exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service company may also enhance the competitiveness of firm that may not have the internal resource and capability of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resource owning country to partner with private sector oil and gas company in order to monetize national resource reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset an operating incident significant cybersecurity disruption or other adverse event such those described in this item may have negative impact on our reputation which in turn could make it more difficult for to compete successfully for new opportunity obtain necessary regulatory approval or could reduce consumer demand for our branded product exxonmobil reputation may also be harmed by event which negatively affect the image of our industry whole projection estimate and description of exxonmobil plan and objective included or incorporated in item and of this report are forward looking statement actual future result including project completion date production rate capital expenditure cost and business plan could differ materially due to among other thing the factor discussed above and elsewhere in this report item unresolved staff comment none item property information with regard to oil and gas producing activity follows disclosure of reserve summary of oil and gas reserve at year end the table below summarizes the oil equivalent proved reserve in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiary and equity company natural gas is converted to an oil equivalent basis at six

view of equity company reserve it ha for reserve from consolidated subsidiary the corporation anticipates several project will come online over the next year providing additional production capacity however actual volume will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start ups operational outage reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery project regulatory change the impact of fiscal and commercial term asset sale weather event price effect on production sharing contract change in the amount and timing of capital investment that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factor described in item risk factor the estimation of proved reserve which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluation commercial and market assessment and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such flow rate and reservoir pressure furthermore the corporation only record proved reserve for project which have received significant funding commitment by management made toward the development of the reserve although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserve will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by number of factor including completion of development project reservoir performance regulatory approval government policy consumer preference and significant change in long term oil and natural gas price level in addition proved reserve could be affected by an extended period of low price which could reduce the level of the corporation capital spending and also impact our partner capacity to fund their share of joint project technology used in establishing proved reserve addition in addition to exxonmobil proved reserve in were based on estimate generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing well established technology that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent result data used in these integrated assessment included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such well log reservoir core sample fluid sample static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurement including high quality and seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tool used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software and commercially available data analysis package in some circumstance where appropriate analog reservoir were available reservoir parameter from these analog were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserve estimate qualification of reserve technical oversight group and internal control over proved reserve exxonmobil ha dedicated global reserve group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibility of this group include oversight of the reserve estimation process for compliance with security and exchange commission sec rule and regulation review of annual change in reserve estimate and the reporting of exxonmobil proved reserve this group also maintains the official company reserve estimate for exxonmobil proved reserve of crude oil natural gas liquid bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and it affiliate the manager of the global reserve group ha more than year of experience in reservoir engineering and reserve assessment ha degree in engineering and currently serf on the oil and gas reserve committee of the society of petroleum engineer spe the group is staffed with individual that have an average of more than year of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserve under the sec guideline this group includes individual who hold advanced degree in either engineering or geology the global reserve group maintains central database containing the official company reserve estimate appropriate control including limitation on database access and update capability are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system control is performed by internal audit key component of the reserve estimation process include technical evaluation and analysis of well and field performance and rigorous peer review no change may be made to the reserve estimate in the central database including addition of any new initial reserve estimate or subsequent revision unless these change have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the operating organization in addition change to reserve estimate that exceed certain threshold require review and approval of the appropriate level of management within the operating organization the change may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserve group for all proved reserve change is mandatory component of this review process after all change are made review are held with senior management for final endorsement proved undeveloped reserve at year end approximately billion oil equivalent barrel goeb of exxonmobil proved reserve were classified proved undeveloped this represents percent of the goeb reported in proved reserve this compare to the goeb of proved undeveloped reserve reported at the end of during the year exxonmobil conducted development activity that resulted in the transfer of approximately goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserve by year end the largest transfer were related to drilling activity in the united state the united arab emirate canada and russia during extension and discovery primarily in the united state resulted in an addition of approximately goeb of proved undeveloped reserve also the corporation reclassified approximately goeb of proved undeveloped reserve which no longer met the sec definition of proved reserve primarily in the netherlands at the groningen gas field and the united state overall investment of billion were made by the corporation during to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserve including billion for oil and gas producing activity and additional investment for other non oil and gas producing activity such the construction of support infrastructure and other related facility these investment represented percent of the billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditure one of exxonmobil requirement for reporting proved reserve is that management ha made significant funding commitment toward the development of the reserve exxonmobil ha disciplined investment strategy and many major field require long lead time in order to be developed development project typically take several year from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserve to the start of production and can exceed five year for large and complex project proved undeveloped reserve in the united state canada australia and kazakhstan have remained undeveloped for five year or more primarily due to constraint on the capacity of infrastructure well the time required to complete development for very large project the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserve will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by number of factor including completion of development project reservoir performance regulatory approval government policy consumer preference the pace of co venturer government funding change in the amount and timing of capital investment and significant change in long term oil and natural gas price level of the proved undeveloped reserve that have been reported for five or more year over percent are contained in the aforementioned country in canada proved undeveloped reserve are related to drilling activity in the offshore hebron field and onshore cold lake operation in australia proved undeveloped reserve are associated with future compression for the gorgon jansz lng project in kazakhstan the proved undeveloped reserve are related to the remainder of the initial development of the producing offshore kashagan field which is included in the north caspian production sharing agreement and the tengizchevroil joint venture which includes production license in the tengiz korolev field complex the tengizchevroil joint venture is producing and proved undeveloped

factor discussed herein and in item risk factor the term project used in this report can refer to variety of different activity and doe not necessarily have the same meaning in any government payment transparency report overview the following discussion and analysis of exxonmobil financial result well the accompanying financial statement and related note to consolidated financial statement to which they refer are the responsibility of the management of exxon mobil corporation the corporation accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect it integrated business model involving exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas and manufacture trade transport and sale of crude oil natural gas petroleum product petrochemical and wide variety of specialty product exxonmobil with it resource base financial strength disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio is well positioned to participate in substantial investment to develop new energy supply the company integrated business model with significant investment in upstream downstream and chemical segment reduces the corporation risk from change in commodity price while commodity price depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on short term basis exxonmobil investment decision are grounded on fundamental reflected in our long term business outlook and use disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunity the corporate plan is fundamental annual management process that is the basis for setting near term operating and capital objective in addition to providing the longer term economic assumption used for investment evaluation purpose volume are based on individual field production profile which are also updated annually price range for crude oil natural gas refined product and chemical product are based on corporate plan assumption developed annually by major region and are utilized for investment evaluation purpose major investment opportunity are evaluated over range of potential market condition once major investment are made reappraisal process is completed to ensure relevant lesson are learned and improvement are incorporated into future project management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation business environment and risk assessment long term business outlook the long term business outlook is based on the corporation outlook for energy which is used to help inform our long term business strategy and investment plan by the world population is projected at around billion people or about billion more than in coincident with this population increase the corporation expects worldwide economic growth to average close to percent per year with economic output nearly doubling by economy and population grow and living standard improve for billion of people the need for energy is expected to continue to rise even with significant efficiency gain global energy demand is projected to rise by about percent from to this increase in energy demand is expected to be driven by developing country those that are not member nation of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd expanding prosperity help drive global energy demand higher increasing use of energy efficient technology and practice well lower emission fuel will continue to help significantly reduce energy consumption and emission per unit of economic output over time substantial efficiency gain are likely in all key aspect of the world economy through affecting energy requirement for power generation transportation industrial application and residential and commercial need global electricity demand is expected to increase approximately percent from to with developing country likely to account for about percent of the increase consistent with this projection power generation is expected to remain the largest and fastest growing major segment of global primary energy demand supported by wide variety of energy source the share of coal fired generation is likely to decline substantially and approach percent of the world electricity in versus nearly percent in in part result of policy to improve air quality well reduce greenhouse gas emission to address the risk of climate change from to the amount of electricity supplied using natural gas nuclear power and renewables is likely to nearly double and account for about percent of the growth in electricity supply electricity from wind and solar is likely to increase about percent helping total renewables including other source hydropower to account for about half of the increase in electricity supply worldwide through total renewables will likely reach nearly percent of global electricity supply by natural gas and nuclear are also expected to increase share over the period to reaching about percent and percent of global electricity supply respectively by supply of electricity by energy type will reflect significant difference across region reflecting wide range of factor including the cost and availability of various energy supply energy for transportation including car truck ship train and airplane is expected to increase approximately percent from to transportation energy demand is likely to account for approximately percent of the growth in liquid fuel demand worldwide over this period liquid fuel demand for light duty vehicle is expected to remain relatively flat to the impact of better fuel economy and significant growth in electric car led by china europe and the united state work to offset growth in the worldwide car fleet of about percent by light duty vehicle are expected to account for about percent of global liquid fuel demand during the same time period nearly all the world transportation fleet are likely to continue to run on liquid fuel which are widely available and offer practical advantage in providing large quantity of energy in small volume liquid fuel provide the largest share of global energy supply today reflecting broad based availability affordability ease of transportation and fitness practical solution to meet wide variety of need by global demand for liquid fuel is projected to grow to approximately million barrel of oil equivalent per day an increase of about percent from the non oecd share of global liquid fuel demand is expected to increase to about percent by liquid fuel demand in the oecd is likely to decline by close to percent much of the global liquid fuel demand today is met by crude production from traditional conventional source these supply will remain important and significant development activity is expected to offset much of the natural decline from these field at the same time variety of emerging supply source including tight oil deepwater oil sand natural gas liquid and biofuels are expected to grow to help meet rising demand the world resource base is sufficient to meet projected demand through technology advance continue to expand the availability of economic supply option however timely investment will remain critical to meeting global need with reliable and affordable supply natural gas is versatile and practical fuel for wide variety of application and it is expected to grow the most of any primary energy type from to meeting more than percent of global energy demand growth global natural gas demand is expected to rise nearly percent from to with about percent of that increase in the asia pacific region significant growth in supply of unconventional gas the natural gas found in shale and other tight rock formation will help meet these need in total about percent of the growth in natural gas supply is expected to be from unconventional source at the same time conventionally produced natural gas is likely to remain the cornerstone of global supply meeting about two third of worldwide demand in liquefied natural gas lng trade will expand significantly meeting about one third of the increase in global demand growth with much of this supply expected to help meet rising demand in asia pacific management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation the world energy mix is highly diverse and will remain through oil is expected to remain the largest source of energy with it share remaining close to one third in coal is currently the second largest source of energy but it is likely to lose that position to natural gas in the timeframe the share of natural gas is expected to reach percent by while the share of coal fall to about percent nuclear power is projected to grow significantly many nation are likely to expand nuclear capacity to address rising electricity need well energy security and environmental issue total renewable energy is likely to exceed percent of global energy by with biomass hydro and geothermal contributing combined share of more than percent total energy supplied from wind solar and biofuels is expected to increase rapidly growing nearly percent from to when they will likely be about percent of the world energy mix the corporation anticipates that the world available oil and gas resource base will grow not only from new discovery but also from increase in previously discovered field technology will underpin these increase the investment to develop and supply resource to meet global demand through will be significant even if demand remains flat this reflects fundamental aspect of the oil and natural gas business in that the international energy agency iea note in it world energy outlook key underlying driver for new investment is declining output from existing field according to the iea new policy scenario the investment required to meet oil and natural gas supply requirement worldwide over the period will be about trillion measured in dollar or approximately billion per year on average international accord and underlying regional and national regulation covering greenhouse gas emission continue to evolve with uncertain timing and outcome making it difficult to predict their business impact for many year the corporation ha taken into account policy established to reduce energy related greenhouse gas emission in it long term outlook for energy the climate accord reached at the conference of the party cop in paris set many new goal and many related policy are still emerging our outlook reflects an environment with increasingly stringent climate policy and is consistent with the aggregation of nationally determined contribution which were submitted by signatory to the united nation framework convention on climate change unfccc paris agreement our outlook seek to identify potential impact of climate related policy which often target specific sector it estimate potential impact of these policy on consumer energy demand by using various assumption and tool including depending on the sector application of proxy cost of carbon or assessment of targeted policy automotive fuel economy standard for purpose of the outlook proxy cost on energy related emission is assumed to reach about per tonne on average in in oecd nation china and other leading non oecd nation are expected to trail oecd policy initiative nevertheless people and nation look for way to reduce risk of global climate change they will continue to need practical solution that do not jeopardize the affordability or reliability of the energy they need practical solution to the world energy and climate challenge will benefit from market competition well well informed well designed and transparent policy approach that carefully weigh cost and benefit such policy are likely to help manage the risk of climate change while also enabling society to pursue other high priority goal around the world including clean air and water access to reliable affordable energy and economic progress for all people all practical and economically viable energy source both conventional and unconventional will need to be pursued to continue meeting global energy demand recognizing the scale and variety of worldwide energy need well the importance of expanding access to modern energy to promote better standard of living for billion of people the information provided in the long term business outlook includes exxonmobil internal estimate and forecast based upon internal data and analysis well publicly available information from external source including the international energy agency upstream exxonmobil continues to sustain diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunity which enables the corporation to be selective maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risk exxonmobil fundamental strategy guide our global upstream business including capturing material and accretive opportunity to continually high grade the resource portfolio selectively developing attractive oil and natural gas resource developing and applying high impact technology and pursuing productivity and efficiency gain these strategy are underpinned by relentless focus on operational excellence development of our employee and investment in the community within which we operate future development project and drilling activity bring new production online the corporation expects shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunity from which volume are produced based on current investment plan oil equivalent production from the america is expected to increase to be majority of total production over the next several year further the proportion of our global production from unconventional deepwater and lng resource type currently contributes over third of global production and is expected to grow to be more than half in the next few year management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation the corporation anticipates several project will come online over the next few year providing additional production capacity however actual volume will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start ups operational outage reservoir performance performance of enhanced oil recovery project regulatory change the impact of fiscal and commercial term asset sale weather event price effect on production sharing contract change in the amount and timing of capital investment that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment and other factor described in item risk factor the market for crude oil and natural gas have history of significant price volatility exxonmobil belief price over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand with the demand side largely being function of general economic activity level of prosperity technology advance consumer preference and government policy on the supply side price may be significantly impacted by political event the action of opec and other large government resource owner and other factor to manage the risk associated with price exxonmobil evaluates annual plan and major investment across range of price scenario in the upstream business produced million oil equivalent barrel per day during the year the corporation added billion oil equivalent barrel of proved reserve the corporation continued to have exploration success in guyana and also made strategic acreage acquisition in mozambique brazil papua new guinea and tight oil downstream exxonmobil downstream is large diversified business with global logistics trading refining and marketing the corporation ha presence with established market in the america and europe well in the growing asia pacific region exxonmobil fundamental downstream business strategy competitively position the company across range of market condition these strategy include targeting best in class operation in all aspect of the business maximizing value from advanced technology capitalizing on integration across exxonmobil business selectively investing for resilient advantaged return operating efficiently and effectively and providing quality valued and differentiated product and service to customer exxonmobil operating result noted in item property reflect refinery located in country with distillation capacity of million barrel per day and lubricant basestock manufacturing capacity of thousand barrel per day exxonmobil fuel and lube value chain have significant global reach with multiple channel to market serving diverse customer base our portfolio of world renowned brand includes exxon mobil esso synergy and mobil demand for product continued to grow in north america margin strengthened and refinery within the region also benefitted from crude differential associated with the permian basin and western canada margin in europe and asia weakened under pressure from lower cost production from north america and increased product export from china in the near term we see variability in refining margin new capacity addition are expected to outpace capacity rationalization and growth in global demand which can also be affected by global economic condition and regulatory change refining margin are largely driven by difference in commodity price and are function of the difference between refinery pay for it raw material primarily crude oil and the market price for the range of product produced primarily gasoline heating oil diesel oil jet fuel and fuel oil crude oil and many product are widely traded with published price including those quoted on multiple exchange around the world new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange price for these commodity are determined by the global marketplace and are influenced by many factor including global and regional supply demand balance inventory level industry refinery operation import export balance currency fluctuation seasonal demand weather and political climate exxonmobil long term outlook is that industry refining margin will remain volatile subject to the pace of new capacity growth relative to global demand growth exxonmobil integration including logistics trading refining and marketing enhances our ability to generate return across the value chain in both fuel and lubricant business described in more detail in item risk factor proposed carbon policy and other climate related regulation in many country well the continued growth in biofuels mandate could have negative impact on the downstream business management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation exxonmobil continued to progress the multi year transition of the direct served dealer company operated retail network in portion of europe to more capital efficient branded wholesaler model the lubricant business continues to grow leveraging world class brand and integration with industry leading basestock refining capability through the mobil branded property such mobil mobil is the worldwide leader among synthetic motor oil the downstream portfolio is continually evaluated during all part of the business cycle and numerous asset divestments have been made over the past decade when investing in the downstream exxonmobil remains focused on selective and resilient project at the end of three key project are in operation with the new delayed coker unit at the refinery in antwerp belgium to upgrade low value bunker fuel into higher value diesel product and the proprietary hydrocracker at the refinery in rotterdam netherlands to produce higher value ultra low sulfur diesel and group ii basestocks finally the new hydrofiner at the beaumont texas refinery wa completed which increase production of ultra low sulfur fuel by approximately barrel per day chemical exxonmobil is major manufacturer and marketer of petrochemical and wide variety of specialty product exxonmobil sustains it competitive advantage through continued operational excellence investment and cost discipline balanced portfolio of product and integration with downstream and upstream operation all underpinned by proprietary technology demand for product continued to grow in polyolefin and specialty product margin weakened with capacity addition outpacing global demand growth over the long term demand for chemical product is forecast to outpace growth in global gdp and energy demand for the next two decade exxonmobil estimate that global demand for chemical will rise by approximately percent over the next decade exxonmobil integration with refining enhances our ability to generate return across the value chain in chemical business in we completed start up of the new world scale ethane cracker in baytown texas the specialty elastomer plant expansion in newport wale and the new halobutyl rubber unit in singapore to further extend our specialty product capacity construction continues on the expansion of the polyethylene plant in beaumont texas with

available surplus to the corporation immediate need is carefully managed through counterparty quality and investment guideline to ensure it is secure and readily available to meet the corporation cash requirement and to optimize return to support cash flow in future period the corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new field and continue to develop and apply new technology and recovery process to existing field in order to maintain or increase production after period of production at plateau rate it is the nature of oil and gas field eventually to produce at declining rate for the remainder of their economic life averaged over all the corporation existing oil and gas field and without new project and growth in key tight oil play exxonmobil production is expected to decline at an average of approximately percent per year over the next few year decline rate can vary widely by individual field due to number of factor including but not limited to the type of reservoir fluid property recovery mechanism work activity and age of the field furthermore the corporation net interest in production for individual field can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial term the corporation ha long been successful at offsetting the effect of natural field decline through disciplined investment in quality opportunity and project execution the

ngl per barrel natural gas per thousand cubic foot consolidated subsidiary crude oil natural gas petroleum product and chemical price have fluctuated in response to changing market force the impact of these price fluctuation on earnings from upstream downstream and chemical operation have varied in the upstream per barrel change in the weighted average realized price of oil would have approximately million annual after tax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings excluding the impact of derivative similarly per thousand cubic foot change in the worldwide average gas realization would have approximately million annual after tax effect on upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings excluding the impact of derivative for any given period the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movement of individual type of crude oil result of trading activity tax and other government take impact price adjustment lag in long term gas contract and crude and gas production volume accordingly change in benchmark price for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicator of change in the earnings experienced in any particular period in the very competitive downstream and chemical environment earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price level of product sold refining margin are function of the difference between what refiner pay for it raw material primarily crude oil and the market price for the range of product produced these price in turn depend on global and regional supply demand balance inventory level refinery operation import export balance and weather management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation the global energy market can give rise to extended period in which market condition are adverse to one or more of the corporation business such condition along with the capital intensive nature of the industry and very long lead time associated with many of our project underscore the importance of maintaining strong financial position management view the corporation financial strength competitive advantage in general segment result are not dependent on the ability to sell and or purchase product to from other segment instead where such sale take place they are the result of efficiency and competitive advantage of integrated refinery chemical complex additionally intersegment sale are at market based price the product bought and sold between segment can also be acquired in worldwide market that have substantial liquidity capacity and transportation capability about percent of the corporation intersegment sale represent upstream production sold to the downstream other intersegment sale include those between refinery and chemical plant related to raw material feedstock and finished product although price level of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global economic condition political event decision by opec and other major government resource owner and other factor industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand accordingly the corporation evaluates the viability of it major investment over range of price the corporation ha an active asset management program in which underperforming asset are either improved to acceptable level or considered for divestment the asset management program includes disciplined regular review to ensure that all asset are contributing to the corporation strategic objective resulting in an efficient capital base risk management the corporation size strong capital structure geographic diversity and the complementary nature of the upstream downstream and chemical business reduce the corporation enterprise wide risk from change in commodity price currency rate and interest rate in addition the corporation us commodity based contract including derivative to manage commodity price risk and for trading purpose the corporation commodity derivative are not accounted for under hedge accounting at time the corporation also enters into forward currency and interest rate derivative none of which are material to the corporation financial position of december and or result of operation for the year ended and credit risk associated with the corporation derivative position is mitigated by several factor including the use of derivative clearing exchange and the quality of and financial limit placed on derivative counterparties no material market or credit risk to the corporation financial position result of operation or liquidity exist result of the derivative described in note the corporation maintains system of control that includes the authorization reporting and monitoring of derivative activity the corporation is exposed to change in interest rate primarily on it short term debt and the portion of long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting the corporation debt would not be material to earnings cash flow or fair value the corporation ha access to significant capacity of long term and short term liquidity internally generated fund are expected to cover the majority of financial requirement supplemented by long term and short term debt some joint venture partner are dependent on the credit market and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint venture project the corporation conduct business in many foreign currency and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flow related to sale expense financing and investment transaction fluctuation in exchange rate are often offsetting and the impact on exxonmobil geographically and functionally diverse operation are varied the corporation make limited use of currency exchange contract to mitigate the impact of change in currency value and exposure related to the corporation limited use of the currency exchange contract are not material inflation and other uncertainty the general rate of inflation in many major country of operation ha remained moderate over the past few year and the associated impact on non energy cost ha generally been mitigated by cost reduction from efficiency and productivity improvement price for service and material continue to evolve in response to constant change in commodity market and industry activity impacting operating and capital cost the corporation monitor market trend and work to minimize cost in all commodity price environment through it economy of scale in global procurement and it efficient project management practice management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation recently issued accounting standard effective january the corporation adopted the financial accounting standard board standard lease topic amended the standard requires all lease to be recorded on the balance sheet right of use asset and lease liability the corporation used transition method that applies the new lease standard at january and recognizes any cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings the corporation applied policy election to exclude short term lease from balance sheet recognition and also elected certain practical expedient at adoption permitted under these expedient the corporation did not reassess whether existing contract are or contain lease the lease classification for any existing lease initial direct cost for any existing lease and whether existing land easement and right of way that were not previously accounted for lease are or contain lease at january the operating lease liability is estimated to be in the range of billion and the operating lease right of use asset is estimated to be in the range of billion including about billion related to prepaid lease the cumulative effect adjustment is expected to be de minimis critical accounting estimate the corporation accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect it integrated business model involving exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas and manufacture trade transport and sale of crude oil natural gas petroleum product petrochemical and wide variety of specialty product the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability the corporation accounting policy are summarized in note oil and natural gas reserve the estimation of proved reserve is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluation commercial and market assessment and detailed analysis of well information such flow rate and reservoir pressure decline among other factor the estimation of proved reserve is controlled by the corporation through long standing approval guideline reserve change are made within well established disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professional assisted by the global reserve group which ha significant technical experience culminating in review with and approval by senior management notably the corporation doe not use specific quantitative reserve target to determine compensation key feature of the reserve estimation process are covered in disclosure of reserve in item oil and natural gas reserve include both proved and unproved reserve proved oil and natural gas reserve are determined in accordance with security and exchange commission sec requirement proved reserve are those quantity of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating condition and government regulation proved reserve are determined using the average of first of month oil and natural gas price during the reporting year proved reserve can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserve proved developed reserve include amount which are expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve include amount expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled proved acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for completion proved undeveloped reserve are recognized only if development plan ha been adopted indicating that the reserve are scheduled to be drilled within five year unless specific circumstance support longer period of time the percentage of proved developed reserve wa percent of total proved reserve at year end including both consolidated and equity company reserve an increase from percent in and ha been over percent for the last ten year although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserve will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by number of factor including completion of development project reservoir performance regulatory approval government policy consumer preference and significant change in long term oil and natural gas price unproved reserve are quantity of oil and natural gas with le than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserve probable reserve are reserve that together with proved reserve are likely not to be recovered revision in previously estimated volume of proved reserve for existing field can occur due to the evaluation or re evaluation of already available geologic reservoir or production data new geologic reservoir or production data or change in the average of first of month oil and natural gas price and or cost that are used in the estimation of reserve revision can also result from significant change in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation unit of production depreciation oil and natural gas reserve quantity are used the basis to calculate unit of production depreciation rate for most upstream asset depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserve or proved developed reserve applied to actual production the volume produced and asset cost are known while proved reserve are based on estimate that are subject to some variability in the event that the unit of production method doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset an alternative method is used the straight line method may be used in limited situation where the expected life of the asset doe not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserve for example certain asset used in the production of oil and natural gas have shorter life than the reserve and such the corporation us straight line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of it useful life to the extent that proved reserve for property are substantially de booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life asset will be depreciated using unit of production method based on reserve determined at the most recent sec price which result in more meaningful quantity of proved reserve appropriately adjusted for production and technical change the effect of this approach on the corporation depreciation expense versus wa immaterial impairment the corporation test asset or group of asset for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among the event or change in circumstance which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following significant decrease in the market price of long lived asset significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in it physical condition including significant decrease in current and projected reserve volume significant adverse change in legal factor or in the business climate that could affect the value including an adverse action or assessment by regulator an accumulation of project cost significantly in excess of the amount originally expected current period operating loss combined with history and forecast of operating or cash flow loss and current expectation that more likely than not long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life asset valuation analysis performed part of it asset management program and other profitability review assist the corporation in assessing whether event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of any of it asset may not be recoverable in general the corporation doe not view temporarily low price or margin an indication of impairment management belief that price over the long term must be sufficient to generate investment in energy supply to meet global demand although price will occasionally drop significantly industry price over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamental on the supply side industry production from mature field is declining this is being offset by investment to generate production from new discovery field development and technology and efficiency advancement opec investment activity and production policy also have an impact on world oil supply the demand side is largely function of general economic activity and level of prosperity because the lifespan of the vast majority of the corporation major asset are measured in decade the value of these asset is predominantly based on long term view of future commodity price and production cost during the lifespan of these major asset the corporation expects that oil and gas price will experience significant volatility and consequently these asset will experience period of higher earnings and period of lower earnings or even loss in assessing whether the event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation considers recent period of operating loss in the context of it longer term view of price while near term price are subject to wide fluctuation longer term price view are more stable and meaningful for purpose of assessing future cash flow when the industry experience prolonged and deep reduction in commodity price the market supply and demand condition may result in change to the corporation long term price or margin assumption it us for it capital investment decision to the extent those change result in significant reduction to it long term oil price natural gas price or margin range the corporation may consider that situation in conjunction with other event or change in circumstance such history of operating loss an indicator of potential impairment for certain asset management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in the upstream the standardized measure of discounted cash flow included in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activity is required to use price based on the average of first of month price these price represent discrete point in time and could be higher or lower than the corporation long term price assumption which are used for impairment assessment the corporation belief the standardized measure doe not provide reliable estimate of the expected future cash flow to be obtained from the development and production of it oil and gas property or of the value of it oil and gas reserve and therefore doe not consider it relevant in determining whether event or change in circumstance indicate the need for an impairment assessment if event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation estimate the future undiscounted cash flow of the affected property to judge the recoverability of carrying amount in performing this assessment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset cash flow used in recoverability assessment are based on the corporation assumption which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process and are consistent with the criterion management us to evaluate investment opportunity these evaluation make use of the corporation assumption of future capital allocation crude oil and natural gas commodity price refining and chemical margin volume cost and foreign currency exchange rate volume are based on projected field and facility production profile throughput or sale where unproved reserve exist an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the evaluation cash flow estimate for impairment testing exclude the effect of derivative instrument an asset group is impaired if it estimated undiscounted cash flow are le than the asset carrying value impairment are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value fair value is based on market price if an active market exists for the asset group or discounted cash flow using discount rate commensurate with the risk significant unproved property are assessed for impairment individually and valuation allowance against the capitalized cost are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the property property that are not individually significant are aggregated by group and amortized based on development risk and average holding period the corporation ha robust process to monitor for indicator of potential impairment across it asset group throughout the year this process is aligned with the requirement of asc and relies in part on the corporation planning and budgeting cycle in the corporation identified number of situation where event or change in circumstance indicated that the carrying value of certain long lived asset mainly in north america may not be recoverable accordingly impairment assessment were performed which indicated that certain asset group assessed have future undiscounted cash flow estimate that do not recover their carrying value the corporation result include after tax charge of billion to reduce the carrying value of those asset to fair value the assessment of fair value required the use of level input and assumption that are based upon the view of likely market participant the principal parameter used to establish fair value included estimate of both proved and unproved reserve future commodity price which were consistent with the average of third party industry expert and government agency drilling and development cost discount rate ranging from percent to percent depending on the characteristic of the asset group and comparable market transaction factor which could put further asset at risk of impairment in the future include reduction in the corporation long term price outlook change in the allocation of capital and operating cost increase which exceed the pace of efficiency or the pace of oil and natural gas price increase however due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity price and the relationship between industry price and cost it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charge related to the corporation long lived asset asset retirement obligation the corporation incurs retirement obligation for certain asset the fair value of these obligation are recorded liability on discounted basis which is typically at the time the asset are installed in the estimation of fair value the corporation us assumption and judgment regarding such factor the existence of legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation technical assessment of the asset estimated amount and timing of settlement discount rate and inflation rate asset retirement obligation are disclosed in note to the financial statement suspended exploratory well cost the corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well cost when the well ha found sufficient quantity of reserve to justify it completion producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project exploratory well cost not meeting these criterion are charged to expense the fact and circumstance that support continued capitalization of suspended well at year end are disclosed in note to the financial statement management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation consolidation the consolidated financial statement include the account of subsidiary the corporation control they also include the corporation share of the undivided interest in certain upstream asset liability revenue and expense amount representing the corporation interest in entity that it doe not control but over which it exercise significant influence are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investment in company that are partially owned by the corporation are integral to the corporation operation in some case they serve to balance worldwide risk and in others they provide the only available mean of entry into particular market or area of interest the other party who also have an equity interest in these company are either independent third party or host government that share in the business result according to their ownership the corporation doe not invest in these company in order to remove liability from it balance sheet in fact the corporation ha long been on record supporting an alternative accounting method that would require each investor to consolidate it share of all asset and liability in these partially owned company rather than only it interest in net equity this method of accounting for investment in partially owned company is not permitted by gaap except where the investment are in the direct ownership of share of upstream asset and liability however for purpose of calculating return on average capital employed which is not covered by gaap standard the corporation includes it share of debt of these partially owned company in the determination of average capital employed pension benefit the corporation and it affiliate sponsor nearly defined benefit pension plan in over country the pension and other postretirement benefit footnote note provides detail on pension obligation fund asset and pension expense some of these plan primarily non provide pension benefit that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliate out of corporate cash flow rather than separate pension fund because applicable tax rule and regulatory practice do not encourage advance funding book reserve are established for these plan the portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed service are rendered the portion attributable to the increase in pension obligation due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligation which end when all benefit are paid the primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plan is that pension expense for funded plan also includes credit for the expected long term return on fund asset for funded plan including those in the pension obligation are financed in advance through segregated asset or insurance arrangement these plan are managed in compliance with the requirement of governmental authority and meet or exceed required funding level measured by relevant actuarial and government standard at the mandated measurement date in determining liability and required contribution these standard often require approach and assumption that differ from those used for accounting purpose the corporation will continue to make contribution to these funded plan necessary all defined benefit pension obligation regardless of the funding status of the underlying plan are fully supported by the financial strength of the corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate pension accounting requires explicit assumption regarding among others the long term expected earnings rate on fund asset the discount rate for the benefit obligation and the long term rate for future salary increase pension assumption are reviewed annually by outside actuary and senior management these assumption are adjusted appropriate to reflect change in market rate and outlook the long term expected earnings rate on pension plan asset in wa percent the year and year actual return on pension plan asset were percent and percent respectively the corporation establishes the long term expected rate of return by developing forward looking long term return assumption for each pension fund asset class taking into account factor such the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation single long term rate of return is then calculated the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentage and the long term return assumption for each asset class worldwide reduction of percent in the long term rate of return on asset would increase annual pension expense by approximately million before tax difference between actual return on fund asset and the long term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs such difference are deferred along with other actuarial gain and loss and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employee management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation litigation contingency variety of claim have been made against the corporation and certain of it consolidated subsidiary in number of pending lawsuit management ha regular litigation review including update from corporate and outside counsel to ass the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingency the status of significant claim is summarized in note the corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingency where the incurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated these amount are not reduced by amount that may be recovered under insurance or claim against third party but undiscounted receivables from insurer or other third party may be accrued separately the corporation revise such accrual in light of new information for contingency where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and where feasible an estimate of the possible loss for purpose of our litigation contingency disclosure significant includes material matter well other item which management belief should be disclosed management judgment is required related to contingent liability and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict however the corporation ha been successful in defending litigation in the past payment have not had material adverse effect on operation or financial condition in the corporation experience large claim often do not result in large award large award are often reversed or substantially reduced result of appeal or settlement tax contingency the corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdiction around the world significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingency and tax dispute because the outcome are often difficult to predict the benefit of uncertain tax position that the corporation ha taken or expects to take in it income tax return are recognized in the financial statement if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authority for position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statement is measured at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized reserve is established for the difference between position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and the amount recognized in the financial statement the corporation unrecognized tax benefit and description of open tax year are summarized in note foreign currency translation the method of translating the foreign currency financial statement of the corporation international subsidiary into dollar is prescribed by gaap under these principle it is necessary to select the functional currency of these subsidiary the functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates management selects the functional currency after evaluating this economic environment factor considered by management when determining the functional currency for subsidiary include the currency used for cash flow related to individual asset and liability the responsiveness of sale price to change in exchange rate the history of inflation in the country whether sale are into local market or exported the currency used

exxon mobil corporation the corporation principal business involves exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas and manufacture trade transport and sale of crude oil natural gas petroleum product petrochemical and wide variety of specialty product the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability actual result could differ from these estimate prior year data ha been reclassified in certain case to conform to the presentation basis summary of accounting policy principle of consolidation and accounting for investment the consolidated financial statement include the account of subsidiary the corporation control they also include the corporation share of the undivided interest in certain upstream asset liability revenue and expense amount representing the corporation interest in entity that it doe not control but over which it exercise significant influence are included in investment advance and long term receivables the corporation share of the net income of these company is included in the consolidated statement of income caption income from equity affiliate majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiary are consolidated however certain factor may indicate that majority owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting these factor occur where the minority shareholder are granted by law or by contract substantive participating right these include the right to approve operating policy expense budget financing and investment plan and management compensation and succession plan evidence of loss in value that might indicate impairment of investment in company accounted for on the equity method is assessed to determine if such evidence represents loss in value of the corporation investment that is other than temporary example of key indicator include history of operating loss negative earnings and cash flow outlook significant downward revision to oil and gas reserve and the financial condition and prospect for the investee business segment or geographic region if evidence of an other than temporary loss in fair value below carrying amount is determined an impairment is recognized in the absence of market price for the investment discounted cash flow are used to ass fair value investment in equity security other than consolidated subsidiary and equity method investment are measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in net income the corporation us the modified approach for equity security that do not have readily determinable fair value this modified approach measure investment at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from observable price change in orderly transaction in similar investment of the same issuer the corporation share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investment is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income revenue recognition the corporation generally sell crude oil natural gas and petroleum and chemical product under short term agreement at prevailing market price in some case natural gas product may be sold under long term agreement with periodic price adjustment to reflect market condition revenue is recognized at the amount the corporation expects to receive when the customer ha taken control which is typically when title transfer and the customer ha assumed the risk and reward of ownership the price of certain sale are based on price index that are sometimes not available until the next period in such case estimated realization are accrued when the sale is recognized and are finalized when the price is available such adjustment to revenue from performance obligation satisfied in previous period are not significant payment for revenue transaction is typically due within day future volume delivery obligation that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchase these performance obligation are based on market price at the time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and recorded exchange measured at the book value of the item sold sale and other operating revenue and note and account receivable primarily arise from contract with customer long term receivables are primarily from non customer contract asset are mainly from marketing assistance program and are not significant contract liability are mainly customer prepayment and accrual of expected volume discount and are not significant note to consolidated financial statement income and other tax the corporation excludes from the consolidated statement of income certain sale and value added tax imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transaction with customer and collected on behalf of governmental authority similar tax for which the corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government are reported on gross basis included in both sale and other operating revenue and other tax and duty the corporation account for tax on global intangible low taxed income an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred we have elected not to adopt an option provided by the financial accounting standard board update income statement reporting comprehensive income reclassification of certain tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income the option allowed the reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for stranded tax effect resulting from the tax cut and job act derivative instrument the corporation may use derivative instrument for trading purpose and to offset exposure associated with commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate that arise from existing asset liability and forecasted transaction all derivative instrument are recorded at fair value derivative asset and liability with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criterion are met collateral payable or receivables are netted against derivative asset and derivative liability respectively recognition and classification of the gain or loss that result from adjusting derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative all gain and loss from derivative instrument for which the corporation doe not apply hedge accounting are immediately recognized in earnings we may designate derivative fair value or cash flow hedge for fair value hedge the gain or loss from derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings for cash flow hedge the effective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affect earnings and the ineffective portion of the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is recognized immediately in earnings fair value fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant hierarchy level and are term for the priority of input to valuation technique used to measure fair value hierarchy level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability hierarchy level input are input other than quoted price included within level that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability hierarchy level input are input that are not observable in the market inventory crude oil product and merchandise inventory are carried at the lower of current market value or cost generally determined under the last in first out method lifo inventory cost include expenditure and other charge including depreciation directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to it existing condition and location selling expense and general and administrative expense are reported period cost and excluded from inventory cost inventory of material and supply are valued at cost or le property plant and equipment cost basis the corporation us the successful effort method to account for it exploration and production activity under this method cost are accumulated on field by field basis cost incurred to purchase lease or otherwise acquire property whether unproved or proved are capitalized when incurred exploratory well cost are carried an asset when the well ha found sufficient quantity of reserve to justify it completion producing well and where the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project exploratory well cost not meeting these criterion are charged to expense other exploratory expenditure including geophysical cost and annual lease rental are expensed incurred development cost including cost of productive well and development dry hole are capitalized depreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit of production method or the straight line method which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration note to consolidated financial statement acquisition cost of proved property are amortized using unit of production method computed on the basis of total proved oil and gas reserve capitalized exploratory drilling and development cost associated with productive depletable extractive property are amortized using the unit of production rate based on the amount of proved developed reserve of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facility using current operating method under the unit of production method oil and gas volume are considered produced once they have been measured through meter at custody transfer or sale transaction point at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank in the event that the unit of production method doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset an alternative method is used the straight line method is used in limited situation where the expected life of the asset doe not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserve for example certain asset used in the production of oil and natural gas have shorter life than the reserve and such the corporation us straight line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of it useful life to the extent that proved reserve for property are substantially de booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life asset will be depreciated using unit of production method based on reserve determined at the most recent sec price which result in more meaningful quantity of proved reserve appropriately adjusted for production and technical change investment in refinery chemical process and lube basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on straight line basis over year life service station building and fixed improvement generally are depreciated over year life maintenance and repair including planned major maintenance are expensed incurred major renewal and improvement are capitalized and the asset replaced are retired impairment assessment the corporation test asset or group of asset for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among the event or change in circumstance which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following significant decrease in the market price of long lived asset significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in it physical condition including significant decrease in current and projected reserve volume significant adverse change in legal factor or in the business climate that could affect the value including an adverse action or assessment by regulator an accumulation of project cost significantly in excess of the amount originally expected current period operating loss combined with history and forecast of operating or cash flow loss and current expectation that more likely than not long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life asset valuation analysis performed part of it asset management program and other profitability review assist the corporation in assessing whether event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of any of it asset may not be recoverable in general the corporation doe not view temporarily low price or margin an indication of impairment management belief that price over the long term must be sufficient to generate investment in energy supply to meet global demand although price will occasionally drop significantly industry price over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamental on the supply side industry production from mature field is declining this is being offset by investment to generate production from new discovery field development and technology and efficiency advancement opec investment activity and production policy also have an impact on world oil supply the demand side is largely function of general economic activity and level of prosperity because the lifespan of the vast majority of the corporation major asset are measured in decade the value of these asset is predominantly based on long term view of future commodity price and production cost during the lifespan of these major asset the corporation expects that oil and gas price will experience significant volatility and consequently these asset will experience period of higher earnings and period of lower earnings or even loss in assessing whether the event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation considers recent period of operating loss in the context of it longer term view of price while near term price are subject to wide fluctuation longer term price view are more stable and meaningful for purpose of assessing future cash flow when the industry experience prolonged and deep reduction in commodity price the market supply and demand condition may result in change to the corporation long term price or margin assumption it us for it capital investment decision to the extent those change result in significant reduction to it long term oil price natural gas price or margin range the corporation may consider that situation in conjunction with other event or change in circumstance such history of operating loss an indicator of potential impairment for certain asset note to consolidated financial statement in the upstream the standardized measure of discounted cash flow included in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activity is required to use price based on the average of first of month price these price represent discrete point in time and could be higher or lower than the corporation long term price assumption which are used for impairment assessment the corporation belief the standardized measure doe not provide reliable estimate of the expected future cash flow to be obtained from the development and production of it oil and gas property or of the value of it oil and gas reserve and therefore doe not consider it relevant in determining whether event or change in circumstance indicate the need for an impairment assessment if event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation estimate the future undiscounted cash flow of the affected property to judge the recoverability of carrying amount in performing this assessment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset cash flow used in recoverability assessment are based on the corporation assumption which are developed in the annual planning and budgeting process and are consistent with the criterion management us to evaluate investment opportunity these evaluation make use of the corporation assumption of future capital allocation crude oil and natural gas commodity price refining and chemical margin volume cost and foreign currency exchange rate volume are based on projected field and facility production profile throughput or sale where unproved reserve exist an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the evaluation cash flow estimate for impairment testing exclude the effect of derivative instrument an asset group is impaired if it estimated undiscounted cash flow are le than the asset carrying value impairment are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value fair value is based on market price if an active market exists for the asset group or discounted cash flow using discount rate commensurate with the risk significant unproved property are assessed for impairment individually and valuation allowance against the capitalized cost are recorded based on the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the property property that are not individually significant are aggregated by group and amortized based on development risk and average holding period other gain on sale of proved and unproved property are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of cost applicable to any interest retained any substantial obligation for future performance by the corporation loss on property sold are recognized when incurred or when the property are held for sale and the fair value of the property is le than the carrying value interest cost incurred to finance expenditure during the construction phase of multiyear project are capitalized part of the historical cost of acquiring the constructed asset the project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and end when the constructed asset are ready for their intended use capitalized interest cost are included in property plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related asset asset retirement obligation and environmental liability the corporation incurs retirement obligation for certain asset the fair value of these obligation are recorded liability on discounted basis which is typically at the time the asset are installed the cost associated with these liability are capitalized part of the related asset and depreciated over time the liability are accreted for the change in their present value liability for environmental cost are recorded when it is probable that obligation have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated these liability are not reduced by possible recovery from third party and projected cash expenditure are not discounted foreign currency translation the corporation selects the functional reporting currency for it international subsidiary based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates downstream and chemical operation primarily use the local currency however the dollar is used in country with history of high inflation primarily in latin america and singapore which predominantly sell into the dollar export market upstream operation which are relatively self contained and integrated within particular country such canada the united kingdom norway and continental europe use the local currency some upstream operation primarily in asia and africa use the
