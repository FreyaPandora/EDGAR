purchasing service for nike brand product sold in certain nike market including argentina brazil canada india south africa and uruguay excluding product produced and sold in the same country approximately of nike brand sale occurred in those country any failure of sojitz america to provide these service or any failure of sojitz america bank could disrupt our ability to acquire product from our supplier and to deliver product to our customer in those market such disruption could result in canceled order that would adversely affect sale and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative source of financing at competitive rate our current agreement with sojitz america expire on may international operation and tradeour international operation and source of supply are subject to the usual risk of doing business abroad such the implementation of or potential change in foreign and domestic trade policy increase in import duty anti dumping measure quota safeguard measure trade restriction restriction on the transfer of fund and in certain part of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk not predict the likelihood of such material effect occurring in the future of contentsin recent year uncertain global and regional economic and political condition have affected international trade and increased protectionist action around the world these trend are affecting many global manufacturing and service sector and the footwear and apparel industry whole are not immune company in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different region and in nearly all case we are working together with industry group to address trade issue and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition law notwithstanding our effort protectionist measure have resulted in increase in the cost of our product and additional measure if implemented could adversely affect sale and or profitability for nike well the imported footwear and apparel industry whole we monitor protectionist trend and development throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial process to mitigate trade restriction we are actively monitoring action that may result in additional anti dumping measure and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating other impediment that may limit or delay custom clearance for import of footwear apparel and equipment change in trade policy including new and potential tariff or penalty on imported good may negatively affect corporation with production activity outside the including nike have also been discussion and commentary regarding retaliatory action by country affected by the new tariff and other change in trade policy and certain foreign government have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanction on certain good which could negatively affect corporation with business operation and or consumer market in those country depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reform are implemented by the government and the manner in which foreign government respond to such reform may become necessary for to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our result of operation in addition with respect to proposed trade restriction targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for we are working with broad coalition of global business and trade association representing wide variety of sector to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented address legitimate and core concern ii is consistent with international trade rule and iii reflects and considers china domestic economy and the important role it ha in the global economic community where trade protection measure are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over period of time adequate alternative source of supply for the product obtained from our present supplier if event prevented from acquiring product from our supplier in particular country our operation could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of short term nature although alternate source of supply might not be cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability nike advocate for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in number of regional and bilateral free trade agreement our international operation are also subject to compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act or fcpa and other anti bribery law applicable to our operation we source significant portion of our product from and have important consumer market

internationally with significant number of athletic and leisure footwear company athletic and leisure apparel company sport equipment company and large company having diversified line of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other company for the production capacity of independent manufacturer that produce our product our nike direct operation both through our digital commerce operation and retail store also compete with multi brand retailer selling our product product offering technology marketing expenditure including expenditure for advertising and endorsement pricing cost of production customer service digital commerce platform and social medium presence are area of intense competition this in addition to rapid change in technology and consumer preference in the market for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factor in our operation in addition the competitive nature of retail including shift in the way in which consumer are shopping and the rising trend of digital commerce constitutes risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operation if we not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitor our cost may increase or the consumer demand for our product may decline significantly failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our iconic brand have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brand will depend on our design and marketing effort including advertising and consumer campaign product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including material and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing medium environment including our increasing reliance on social medium and digital dissemination of advertising campaign we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objective of contentsour brand value also depends on our ability to maintain positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture negative claim or publicity involving our product or any of our key employee endorser sponsor or supplier could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claim are accurate social medium which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenge of responding to negative claim adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against or by could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in and reduce long term demand for our product even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operation if the reputation or image of any of our brand is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity our product sale financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to anticipate consumer preference and develop new product we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue and profit our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trend well to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demand in timely manner however lead time for many of our product may make it more difficult for to respond rapidly to new or changing product trend or consumer preference all of our product are subject to changing consumer preference that can not be predicted with certainty our new product may not receive consumer acceptance consumer preference could shift rapidly to different type of performance product or away from these type of product altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these change if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trend and shift in consumer preference by adjusting the mix of existing product offering developing new product design style and category and influencing sport and fitness preference through extensive marketing we could experience lower sale excess inventory or lower profit margin any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition in addition we market our product globally through diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional program and campaign including social medium mobile application and online advertising if we do not successfully market our product or if advertising and promotional cost increase these factor could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we rely on technical innovation and high quality product to compete in the market for our product technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our product research and development play key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialist in the field of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related field well research committee and advisory board made up of athlete coach trainer equipment manager orthopedist podiatrist and other expert to develop and test cutting edge performance product while we strive to produce product that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our product consumer demand for our product could decline and if we experience problem with the quality of our product we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problem failure to continue to obtain or maintain high quality endorser of our product could harm our business we establish relationship with professional athlete sport team and league well other public figure to develop evaluate and promote our product well establish product authenticity with consumer however competition in our industry ha increased the cost associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorship and other relationship have increased if we are unable to maintain our current association with professional athlete sport team and league or other public figure or to do at reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or on field authenticity associated with our product and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investment result our brand net revenue expense and profitability could be harmed furthermore if certain endorser were to stop using our product contrary to their endorsement agreement our business could be adversely affected in addition action taken by athlete team or league or other endorser associated with our product that harm the reputation of those athlete team or league or endorser could also seriously harm our brand image with consumer and result could have an adverse effect on our sale and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorser failure to continue to correctly identify promising athlete or public figure to use and endorse our product or failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangement with prominent athlete public figure and sport organization could adversely affect our brand sale and profitability general economic factor beyond our control and change in the global economic environment including fluctuation in inflation and currency exchange rate could result in lower revenue higher cost and decreased margin and earnings majority of our product are manufactured and sold outside of the united state and we conduct purchase and sale transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to the volatility of global economic condition including fluctuation in inflation and foreign currency exchange rate additionally there ha been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rate result of the united kingdom impending exit from the european union commonly referred to brexit and new or proposed policy change our international revenue and expense generally are derived from sale and operation in foreign currency and these revenue and expense could be affected by currency fluctuation specifically amount recorded in foreign currency and translated into dollar for consolidated financial reporting weakening of foreign currency relative to the dollar adversely affect the dollar value of the company foreign currency denominated sale and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuation could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturer that produce our product by making their purchase of raw material more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuation have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we may hedge certain foreign currency exposure to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effect of foreign currency fluctuation on our financial result since the hedging activity are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of stronger dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of weaker dollar or other trading currency our future financial result could be significantly affected by the value of the dollar in relation to the foreign currency in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial result are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activity of contentsglobal economic condition could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact business around the world most acutely in emerging market and developing economy if global economic and financial market condition do not improve or deteriorate the following factor could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our product reduced order from retailer for our product order cancellation lower revenue higher discount increased inventory and lower gross margin in the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital market at reasonable rate in the event we find it desirable to do so we conduct transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar continued volatility in the market and exchange rate for foreign currency and contract in foreign currency including in response to certain policy advocated or implemented by the presidential administration could have significant impact on our reported operating result and financial condition continued volatility in the availability and price for commodity and raw material we use in our product and in our supply chain such cotton or petroleum derivative could have material adverse effect on our cost gross margin and profitability if retailer of our product experience declining revenue or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase our product this could result in reduced order for our product order cancellation late retailer payment extended payment term higher account receivable reduced cash flow greater expense associated with collection effort and increased bad debt expense if retailer of our product experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operation which could negatively impact the sale of our product to consumer if contract manufacturer of our product or other participant in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase raw material or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital need it may result in delay or non delivery of shipment of our product our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuation in our operating result we experience moderate fluctuation in aggregate sale volume during the year historically revenue in the first and fourth fiscal quarter have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarter however the mix of product sale may vary considerably from time to time result of change in seasonal and geographic demand for particular type of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting event such the nba final olympics or the world cup among others in addition our customer may cancel order change delivery schedule or change the mix of product ordered with minimal notice result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sale accordingly our result of operation are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factor that are beyond our control including general economic condition change in consumer preference weather condition availability of import quota transportation disruption and currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect our business and cause our result of operation to fluctuate our operating margin are also sensitive to number of additional factor that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation cost shift in product sale mix and geographic sale trend all of which we expect to continue result of operation in any period should not be considered indicative of the result to be expected for any future period we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customer we extend credit to our customer based on an assessment of customer financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our product we offer certain customer the opportunity to place order five to six month ahead of delivery under our future ordering program these advance order may be canceled under certain condition and the risk of cancellation may increase dealing with financially unstable retailer or retailer struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customer have experienced financial difficulty up to and including bankruptcy which have had an adverse effect on our sale our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or consumer behavior shift retailer may be more cautious with order slowing or changing economy in our key market could adversely affect the financial health of our customer which in turn could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition in addition product sale are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumer which requires continuing investment by retailer retailer that experience financial difficulty may fail to make such investment or delay them resulting in lower sale and order for our product failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventory or inventory shortage which could result in decreased operating margin reduced cash flow and harm to our business to meet anticipated demand for our product we purchase product from manufacturer outside of our future ordering program and in advance of customer order which we hold in inventory and resell to customer there is risk we may be unable to sell excess product ordered from manufacturer inventory level in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write down and the sale of excess inventory at discounted price could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating result financial condition and cash flow conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our product or if our manufacturer fail to supply product we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortage inventory shortage might delay shipment to customer negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationship and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also make it difficult to estimate our future result of operation financial condition and cash flow from period to period failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our product could adversely affect our net revenue and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effect with any certainty in advance of contentsconsolidation of retailer or concentration of retail market share among retailer may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell product the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail market in some country are dominated by few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailer with many store these retailer have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisition and construction of additional store these situation concentrate our credit risk with relatively small number of retailer and if any of these retailer were to experience shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shift away from traditional retail it would increase the risk that their outstanding payable to may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or few retailer in particular country or region increase the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchase of our product we may be unable to find sufficient number of other retail outlet for our product to sustain the same level of sale and revenue our nike direct

the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from change in currency exchange rate our primary foreign currency exposure arise from the recording of transaction denominated in non functional currency and the translation of foreign currency denominated result of operation financial position and cash flow into dollar our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated result of operation financial position and cash flow we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on portfolio basis to address those risk material to nike inc we manage these exposure by taking advantage of natural offset and currency correlation existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging portion of the remaining exposure using derivative instrument such forward contract and option described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offset and currency correlation benefit existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposure our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate change on the underlying net exposure being hedged where exposure are hedged our program ha the

additional description of how the above financial instrument are valued and recorded well the fair value of outstanding derivative at each reported period end transactional exposureswe conduct business in various currency and have transaction which subject to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposure are product cost nike product cost are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency in the following way product purchase denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the transacting entity certain nike entity purchase product from the ntc wholly owned sourcing hub that buy nike branded product from third party factory predominantly in dollar the ntc whose functional currency is the dollar then sell the product to nike entity in their respective functional currency ntc sale to nike entity with different functional currency result in foreign currency exposure for the ntc other nike entity purchase product directly from third party factory in dollar these purchase generate foreign currency exposure for those nike entity with functional currency other than the dollar in both purchasing scenario weaker dollar decrease inventory cost incurred by nike whereas stronger dollar increase it cost factory input cost nike operates foreign currency adjustment program with certain factory the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factory foreign currency exposure some of which are natural offset to our existing foreign currency exposure under this program our payment to these factory are adjusted for rate fluctuation in the basket of currency factory currency exposure index in which the labor material and overhead cost incurred by the factory in the production of nike branded product factory input cost are denominated for the currency within the factory currency exposure index that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventory and is recognized in cost of sale when the related product is sold to third party all currency within the index excluding the

derivative in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail an offset to the impact of the fluctuating dollar on our non functional currency denominated product purchase described above strengthening dollar against the foreign currency within the factory currency exposure index decrease nike dollar inventory cost conversely weakening dollar against the indexed foreign currency increase our inventory cost non functional currency denominated external sale portion of our emea geography revenue well portion of our converse european operation revenue are earned in currency other than the euro the british pound but are recognized at subsidiary that us the euro it functional currency these sale generate foreign currency exposure other cost non functional currency denominated cost such endorsement contract also generate foreign currency risk though to lesser extent in certain case the company ha entered into contractual agreement which have payment indexed to foreign currency that create embedded derivative contract recorded at fair value through other expense income net refer to note risk management and derivative in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail non functional currency denominated monetary asset and liability our global subsidiary have various asset and liability primarily

create fluctuation in other expense income net within our consolidated result of operation managing transactional exposurestransactional exposure are managed on portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposure by taking advantage of natural offset and currency correlation that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contract to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuation on probable forecasted future cash flow including certain product cost exposure non functional currency denominated external sale and other cost described above generally these are accounted for cash flow hedge in accordance with gaap except for hedge of the embedded derivative component of the product cost exposure and other contractual agreement discussed above certain currency forward contract used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency denominated monetary asset and liability subject to re measurement and embedded derivative contract are not formally designated hedging instrument under gaap accordingly change in fair value of these instrument are immediately recognized in other

contract being hedged of contentstranslational exposuresmany of our foreign subsidiary operate in functional currency other than the dollar fluctuation in currency exchange rate create volatility in our reported result we are required to translate the balance sheet operational result and cash flow of these subsidiary into dollar for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiary non

beginning in fiscal we anticipate the functional currency of our argentina subsidiary within our apla operating segment will change from the local currency to dollar the subsidiary will be operating in hyper inflationary market result it non dollar denominated monetary asset and liability will be subject to re measurement and recorded in other expense income net within the consolidated statement

condition managing translational exposuresto minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenue and expense into dollar for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiary use excess cash to purchase dollar denominated available for sale investment the variable future cash flow associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these dollar denominated security at non dollar functional currency subsidiary creates foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standard for derivative and hedging we utilize forward contract and or option to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchase and sale of these dollar investment the combination of the purchase and sale of the dollar investment and the hedging instrument ha the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investment are sold hedge of available for sale investment are accounted for cash flow hedge we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profit from our international business and the year over year change in foreign currency related gain and loss included in other expense income net had an unfavorable impact of approximately million and million on our income before income tax for the year ended may and respectively net investment in foreign subsidiarieswe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation on our investment in wholly owned foreign subsidiary denominated in currency other than the dollar which could adversely impact the dollar value of these investment and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment position in certain

note summary of significant accounting policy in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standard of contentscritical accounting policiesour previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability note summary of significant accounting policy in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement describes the significant accounting policy and method used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement we believe the estimate assumption and judgment involved in the accounting policy described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statement so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy and estimate management ha reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policy with the audit finance committee of the board of director these policy require we make estimate in the preparation of our financial statement of given date because of the uncertainty inherent in these matter actual result could differ from the estimate we use in applying the critical accounting policy within the context of these critical accounting policy we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event or circumstance that would result in materially different amount being reported revenue recognitionwe record wholesale revenue when title pass and the risk and reward of ownership have passed to the customer based on the term of sale title pass generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenue are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenue are recorded upon delivery to the customer in some instance we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenue may fluctuate in case when our customer delay accepting shipment of product for period of up to several week in certain country precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these case we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery time by geographic location on the basis of our test of actual transaction we have no indication these estimate have been materially inaccurate historically part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sale return discount and miscellaneous claim from customer reduction to revenue at the time revenue are recorded our post invoice sale discount consist of contractual program with certain customer or discretionary discount expected to be granted to certain customer at later date we base our estimate on historical rate of product return discount and claim specific identification of outstanding claim and outstanding return not yet received from customer and estimated return discount and claim expected but not yet finalized with our customer actual return discount and claim in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimate if actual or expected future return discount and claim are significantly greater or lower than established reserve we record reduction or increase to net revenue in the period in which we make such determination allowance for uncollectible account receivablewe make ongoing estimate relating to the ability to collect our account receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit loss and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customer based on ongoing credit evaluation since we can not predict future change in the financial stability of our customer actual future loss from uncollectible account may differ from our estimate if the financial condition of our customer were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payment larger allowance might be required in the event we determine smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record credit or charge to operating overhead expense in the period in which such determination is made inventory reserveswe also make ongoing estimate relating to the net realizable value of inventory based upon our assumption about future demand and market condition if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is le than the cost of the inventory recorded on our book we record reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded charge to cost of sale if change in market condition result in reduction in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such determination contingent payment under endorsement contractsa significant amount of our demand creation expense relates to payment under endorsement contract in general endorsement payment are expensed on straight line basis over the term of the contract however certain contract element may be accounted for differently based upon the fact and circumstance of each individual contract certain contract provide for contingent payment to endorser based upon specific achievement in their sport winning championship we record demand creation expense for these amount when the endorser achieves the specific goal certain contract provide for variable payment based upon endorser maintaining level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time maintaining specified ranking in sport for year when we determine payment are probable the amount are reported in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser performance in these instance to the extent actual payment to the endorser differ from our estimate due to change in the endorser performance adjustment to demand creation expense may be recorded in future period of contentscertain contract provide for royalty payment to endorser based upon predetermined percent of sale of particular product we expense these payment in cost of sale the related sale occur in certain contract we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payment for contract for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fee through sale of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sale of product in demand creation expense uniformly over the contract term property plant and equipment and definite lived assetswe review the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment we would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value hedge accounting for derivativeswe use derivative contract to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transaction well certain non functional currency monetary asset and liability when the specific criterion to qualify for hedge accounting ha been met change in the fair value of contract hedging probable forecasted future cash flow are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income rather than net income the underlying hedged transaction affect net income in most case this result in gain and loss on hedge derivative being released from other comprehensive income into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criterion for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contract should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transaction by their very nature our estimate of anticipated transaction may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transaction when anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decline below hedged level or if it is no longer probable forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense income net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs stock based compensationwe account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumption including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded option on our common stock with term greater than one year along with other factor our decision to use implied volatility wa based on the availability of actively traded option on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trend than historical volatility if factor change and we use different assumption for estimating stock based compensation expense in future period stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period income taxeswe are subject to taxation in the united state well various state and foreign jurisdiction the determination of our provision for income tax requires significant judgment the use of estimate and the interpretation and application of complex tax law on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date income before income tax excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item to determine the year to date income tax expense the income tax effect of infrequent or unusual item are recognized in the interim period in which they occur the fiscal year progress we continually refine our estimate based upon actual event and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically result in change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs we record valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset when necessary realization of deferred tax asset such net operating loss carry forward is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increase our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made on quarterly basis we evaluate the probability tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax position based on factor including change in fact or circumstance change in tax law settled audit issue and new audit activity change in our assessment may result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment change we recognize interest and penalty related to income tax matter in income tax expense on december the united state enacted the tax act which significantly change previous tax law including provision for one time transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings reduction in the corporate tax rate from to well other change in accordance with security and exchange commission staff

of the tax act including collecting preparing and analyzing necessary information performing and refining calculation and obtaining additional guidance from the internal revenue service irs treasury department financial accounting standard board fasb or other standard setting and regulatory body on the tax act it may record adjustment to the provisional amount which may be material in accordance with sab the company accounting for the tax effect of the tax act will be completed during the measurement period which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date refer to note income tax in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information of contentsother contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceeding regarding contractual and employment relationship product liability claim trademark right and variety of other matter we record contingent liability resulting from claim against when loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable loss requires analysis of multiple factor including in some case judgment about the potential action of third party claimant and court recorded contingent liability are based on the best information available and actual loss in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustment to estimated probable future loss or actual loss exceed our recorded liability for such claim we would record additional charge during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liability recorded for probable loss we disclose contingent liability when there is reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we can not predict the outcome of pending legal matter with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have material impact on our result of operation financial position or cash flow of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskin the normal course of business and consistent with established policy and procedure we employ variety of financial instrument to manage exposure to fluctuation in the value of foreign currency and interest rate it is our policy to utilize these financial instrument only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposure we do not enter into these transaction for trading or speculative purpose we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation primarily result of our international sale product sourcing and funding activity our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated result of operation financial position and cash flow we use forward and option contract to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transaction well certain firm commitment and the related receivables and payable including third party and intercompany transaction we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or option contract to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation adjustment related to our net investment in those subsidiary where exposure are hedged our program ha the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movement on our consolidated financial statement the timing for hedging exposure well the type and duration of the hedge instrument employed are guided by our hedging policy and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market condition typically the company may enter into hedge contract starting up to to month in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedge up to of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivative outstanding of may are designated foreign currency cash flow hedge primarily for euro dollar british pound euro and japanese yen dollar currency pair refer to note risk management and derivative in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information our earnings are also exposed to movement in short and long term market interest rate our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate change on earnings and cash flow and to reduce overall borrowing cost to achieve these objective we maintain mix of commercial paper

exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instrument only the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instrument the var model estimate assume normal market condition and confidence level there are various modeling technique that can be used in the var computation our computation are based on interrelationship between currency and interest rate variance co variance technique these interrelationship are function of foreign exchange currency market change and interest rate change over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency option doe not change on one to one basis with change in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to change in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuation on the derivative instrument only and doe not include the impact of such rate fluctuation on non functional currency transaction such anticipated transaction firm commitment cash balance and account and loan receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instrument the var model is risk analysis tool and doe not purport to represent actual loss in fair value we will incur nor doe it consider the potential effect of favorable change in market rate it also doe not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gain and loss will differ from those estimated because of change or difference in market rate and interrelationship hedging instrument and hedge percentage timing and other factor the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instrument derived using the var model wa million and million at may and respectively the var decreased year over year result of decrease in foreign currency volatility at may such hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivative would be offset by increase in the value of the underlying transaction being hedged the average monthly change in the fair value of

change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment the company would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assetsthe company performs annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor the company may first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance the company determines it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it carrying amount the two step impairment test is unnecessary the two step impairment test first requires the company to estimate the fair value of it reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis the company measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over it implied fair value if any indefinite lived intangible asset primarily consist of acquired trade name and trademark the company may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance the company determines it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible asset the company
