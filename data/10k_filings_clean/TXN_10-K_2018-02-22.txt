market remain highly fragmented result we face significant global competition from dozen of large and small company including both broad based supplier and niche supplier our competitor also include emerging company particularly in asia that sell product into the market in which we operate we believe that competitive performance in the semiconductor market generally depends on several factor including the breadth of company product line the strength and depth of it channel to market technological innovation product development execution technical support customer service quality reliability capacity and price in addition manufacturing process technology that provide differentiated level of performance are competitive factor for our analog product and customer prior investment in software development is competitive factor for our embedded processing product product cycle the global semiconductor market is characterized by constant though generally incremental advance in product design and manufacturing process semiconductor price and manufacturing cost tend to decline over time manufacturing process and product life cycle mature market cycle the semiconductor cycle refers to the ebb and flow of supply and demand and the building and depleting of inventory the semiconductor market historically ha been characterized by period of tight supply caused by strengthening demand and or insufficient manufacturing capacity followed by period of surplus inventory caused by weakening demand and or excess manufacturing capacity these are typically referred to upturn and downturn in the semiconductor cycle the semiconductor cycle could be affected by the significant time and money required to build and maintain semiconductor manufacturing facility we employ several strategy to dampen the effect of the semiconductor cycle on ti we acquire our manufacturing facility and equipment ahead of demand which usually allows to acquire this capacity lower cost we focus our resource on our analog and embedded processing segment which serve diverse market and diverse customer this diversity reduces our dependence on the performance of single market or small group of customer additionally we utilize consignment inventory program with our customer and distributor that give improved insight into customer demand seasonality our revenue is subject to seasonal variation historically our sequential revenue growth rate tends to be weaker in the first and fourth quarter compared with the second and third quarter customer sale and distribution we sell our product to about customer our customer base is diverse with more than one third of our revenue derived from customer outside our largest we market and sell our semiconductor product direct sale and distributor and online we have sale or marketing office in more than country and we continue to expand and enhance our online presence about percent of our sale are fulfilled through distribution channel our distributor maintain an inventory of our product and sell directly to wide range of customer also sell product from our competitor manufacturing semiconductor manufacturing begin with sequence of photolithographic and chemical processing step that fabricate number of semiconductor device on thin silicon wafer each device on the wafer is packaged and tested the entire process take place in highly specialized facility and requires an average of week with product completed within to week we own and operate semiconductor manufacturing facility in north america asia japan and europe these include both wafer fabrication and assembly test facility our facility require substantial investment to construct and are largely fixed cost asset in operation we do most of our manufacturing in house this strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing help ensure consistent supply of product for our customer and also allows to invest in technology that differentiates the feature of our product we have focused on creating competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loading of our advanced analog millimeter wafer which have about percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over millimeter wafer millimeter wafer will support the majority of our analog growth going forward additionally we keep our manufacturing cost low by using mature asset acquired ahead of demand when their price are most attractive we expect to continue to maintain sufficient internal manufacturing capacity to meet the vast majority of our production need and to obtain manufacturing equipment to support new technology development and revenue growth to supplement our manufacturing capacity and maximize our responsiveness to customer demand we use the capacity of outside supplier commonly known foundry and subcontractor in we sourced about percent of our total wafer from external foundry and about percent of our assembly test service from subcontractor research and development our expense wa billion in compared with billion in and billion in we continually grow and strengthen our broad analog and embedded processing portfolio through disciplined allocation of resource we invest in to develop differentiated product with particular emphasis on designing for the industrial and automotive market we conduct most of our internally we also closely engage with wide range of third party including software supplier university and select industry consortium and we collaborate with our foundry supplier on semiconductor manufacturing technology inventory our long term inventory strategy is to maintain high level of customer service and stable lead time minimize inventory obsolescence and improve manufacturing asset utilization to capitalize on manufacturing efficiency we build in advance of demand low volume long lived device with broad customer base and low risk of obsolescence additionally we sometimes maintain product inventory in unfinished wafer form to allow greater flexibility in period of high demand further we have improved insight into demand and are better able to manage our factory loading because over time we have increased consignment inventory program with our customer and distributor about percent of ti revenue is fulfilled from consignment program our strategy and expected customer demand will cause our inventory level to fluctuate over time longer term we expect to carry more inventory than we have in the past we move towards higher consignment level and more long lived low volume device to serve industrial customer growing portion of our business backlog we define backlog of particular date purchase order with customer requested delivery date within specified length of time our backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of revenue for any future period customer requirement and industry condition change order may be subject to cancellation or modification of term such pricing quantity or delivery date customer order placement practice continually evolve based on customer individual business need and capability well industry supply and capacity consideration further our consignment program do not result in backlog because the order occurs at the same time delivery when the customer pull the product from consigned inventory our backlog of order wa billion at december and billion at december raw material we purchase material part and supply from number of supplier in some case we purchase such item from sole source supplier the material part and supply essential to our business are generally available at present and we believe that such material part and supply will be available in the foreseeable future intellectual property we own many patent and have many patent application pending in the united state and other country in field relating to our business we have developed strong broad based patent portfolio and continually add patent to that portfolio we also have license agreement which vary in duration involving right to our portfolio or those of other company we do not consider our business materially dependent upon any one patent or patent license we often participate in industry initiative to set technical standard our competitor may participate in the same initiative participation in these initiative may require to license certain of our patent to other company on reasonable and non discriminatory term we own trademark that are used in the conduct of our business these trademark are valuable asset the most important of which are texas instrument and our corporate monogram acquisition and divestiture from time to time we consider acquisition and divestiture we focus on transaction that are strategic fit and

with the security and exchange commission sec and in material incorporated by reference into these filing these risk factor are intended to highlight certain factor that may affect our financial condition and result of operation and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risk that apply to ti company with broad international operation like other company we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturn in the united state or abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the performance of our customer similarly the price of our security is subject to volatility due to fluctuation in general market condition actual financial result that do not meet our and or the investment community expectation change in our and or the investment community expectation for our future result and other factor many of which are beyond our control we face substantial competition that requires to respond rapidly to product development and pricing pressure we face intense technological and pricing competition in the market in which we operate we expect this competition will continue to increase from large competitor and from small competitor serving niche market and also from emerging company particularly in asia that sell product into the same market in which we operate for example we may face increased competition result of china actively promoting and reshaping it domestic semiconductor industry through policy change and investment these action may restrict from participating in the china market or may prevent from competing effectively with chinese company certain competitor posse sufficient financial technical and management resource to develop and market product that may compete favorably our product and consolidation among our competitor may allow them to compete more effectively additionally traditional intellectual property licensors are increasingly providing functionality design and complete hardware or software solution that compete with our product the price and product development pressure that result from competition may lead to reduced profit margin and lost business opportunity in the event that we are unable to match the price decline or cost efficiency or meet the technological product support software or manufacturing advancement of our competitor change in expected demand for our product could have material adverse effect on our result of operation our customer include company in wide range of end market and sector within those market if demand in one or more sector within our end market decline or the rate of growth slows our result of operation may be adversely affected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market may lead to significant and rapid increase and decrease in product demand additionally the loss or significant curtailment of purchase by one or more of our large customer including curtailment due to change in the design or manufacturing sourcing policy or practice of these customer or the timing of customer or distributor inventory adjustment may adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our result of operation also might suffer because of general decline in customer demand resulting from for example uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial market natural event or domestic or international political social economic or other condition breach of customer information technology system that disrupt customer operation or customer inability to access credit market and other source of needed liquidity our ability to match inventory and production with the product mix needed to fill order may affect our ability to meet quarter revenue forecast in addition when responding to customer request for shorter shipment lead time we manufacture product based on forecast of customer demand these forecast are based on multiple assumption if we inaccurately forecast customer demand we may hold inadequate excess or obsolete inventory that would reduce our profit margin and adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition our global operation subject to risk associated with domestic or international political social economic or other condition we have facility in more than country about percent of our revenue come from shipment to location outside the united state in particular shipment of product into china typically represent large portion of our revenue we are exposed to political social and economic condition security risk terrorism or other hostile act health condition labor condition and possible disruption in transportation communication and information technology network of the various country in which we operate including the united state additionally certain country where we operate have experienced and other country may experience increasing protectionism that may impact global trade this could result in an adverse effect on our operation and our financial result in addition our global operation expose to period when the dollar significantly fluctuates in relation to the non currency in which we transact business the remeasurement of non dollar transaction can have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition our operating result and our reputation could be adversely affected by breach or disruption of information technology system breach or disruption of our information technology system or the system of our customer vendor and other third party could be caused by factor such computer virus system failure restricted network access unauthorized access terrorism employee malfeasance or human error these event could among other thing compromise our information technology network result in corrupt or lost data or the unauthorized release of our our customer or our supplier confidential or proprietary information cause disruption to our manufacturing and other operation result in the release of personal data or cause to incur cost associated with increased protection remediation or penalty any of which could adversely affect our operating result and our reputation cybersecurity threat are frequent and constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them our result of operation could be affected by natural event in the location in which we operate we have manufacturing data and design facility and other operation in location subject to natural occurrence such severe weather geological event or health epidemic that could disrupt operation natural disaster that result in prolonged disruption to our operation may adversely affect our result and financial condition rapid technological change in market we serve requires to develop new technology and product rapid technological change in market we serve could contribute to shortened product life cycle and decline in average selling price of our product our result of operation depend in part upon our ability to successfully develop manufacture and market innovative product in timely manner we make significant investment in research and development to improve existing technology and product and develop new one to meet changing customer demand in some case we might not realize return on our investment because they are generally made commercial viability can be assured further project that are commercially viable may not contribute significant revenue until at least year after they are completed we face supply chain and manufacturing risk we rely on third party to supply with good and service in cost effective and timely manner our access to needed good and service may be adversely affected by potential dispute with supplier or disruption in our supplier operation result of for example quality excursion uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial market domestic or international political social economic and other condition natural event in the location in which our supplier operate or limited or delayed access to key raw material natural resource and utility additionally breach of our supplier information technology system could result in release of our confidential or proprietary information if our supplier are unable to access credit market and other source of needed liquidity we may be unable to obtain needed supply collect account receivable or access needed technology in particular our manufacturing process and critical manufacturing equipment require that certain key raw material natural resource and utility be available limited or delayed access to and high cost of these item could adversely affect our result of operation our product contain material that are subject to conflict mineral reporting requirement our relationship with customer and supplier may be adversely affected if we are unable to describe our product conflict free additionally our cost may increase if one or more of our customer demand that we change the sourcing of material we can not identify conflict free our inability to timely implement new manufacturing technology or install manufacturing equipment could adversely affect our result of operation we subcontract portion of our wafer fabrication and assembly and testing of our product and we depend on third party to provide advanced logic manufacturing process technology development we do not have long term contract with all of these supplier and the number of alternate supplier is limited reliance on these supplier involves risk including possible shortage of capacity in period of high demand supplier inability to develop and deliver advanced logic manufacturing process technology in timely cost effective and appropriate manner and the possibility of supplier imposition of increased cost on our operation could be affected by the complex law rule and regulation to which our business is subject we are subject to complex law rule and regulation affecting our domestic and international operation relating to for example the environment safety and health export and import bribery and corruption tax data privacy and protection labor and employment competition market access intellectual property ownership and infringement and the movement of currency compliance with these law rule and regulation may be onerous and expensive and could restrict our ability to manufacture or ship our product and operate our business if we fail to comply or if we become subject to enforcement activity we could be subject to fine penalty or other legal liability furthermore should these law rule and regulation be amended or expanded or new one enacted we could incur materially greater compliance cost or restriction on our ability to manufacture our product and operate our business some of these complex law rule and regulation for example those related to environmental safety and health requirement may particularly affect in the jurisdiction in which we manufacture product especially if such law and regulation require the use of abatement equipment beyond we currently employ require the addition or elimination of raw material or process to or from our current manufacturing process or impose cost fee or reporting requirement on the direct or indirect use of energy natural resource or material or gas used or emitted into the environment in connection with the manufacture of our product substitute for prohibited raw material or process might not be available or might not be available at reasonable cost our result of operation and our reputation could be affected by warranty claim product liability claim product recall or legal proceeding we could be subject to claim based on warranty product liability epidemic or delivery failure or other ground relating to our product manufacturing service design communication or cybersecurity that could lead to significant expense we defend such claim or pay damage award or settlement in the event of claim we may also incur cost if we decide to compensate the affected customer or end consumer we maintain product liability insurance is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claim in addition it is possible for one of our customer to recall product containing ti part for example with respect to product used in automotive application or handheld electronics which may cause to incur cost and expense relating to the recall any of these event could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and our reputation our result of operation could be affected by change in tax related matter we have facility in more than country and result are subject to taxation and audit by number of taxing authority tax rate vary among the jurisdiction in which we operate number of factor could cause our tax rate to increase including change in the jurisdiction in which our profit are earned and taxed change in the mix of profit from those jurisdiction change in available tax credit change in applicable tax rate change in tariff regulation or surcharge change in accounting principle or adverse resolution of audit by taxing authority we have deferred tax asset on our balance sheet change in applicable tax law and regulation or in our business performance could affect our ability to realize those deferred tax asset which could also affect our result of operation if our tax rate increase our result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we are subject to law and regulation in various jurisdiction that determine how much profit ha been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction change in these law and regulation including those that align with the organisation for economic cooperation and development base erosion and profit shifting recommendation could affect the location where we are deemed to earn income which could in turn affect our result of operation each quarter we forecast our tax liability based on our forecast of our performance for the year if that performance forecast change our forecasted tax liability will change our initial estimate of the financial impact of the tax cut and job act enacted in december may change we refine our analysis and additional guidance becomes available if in the future we repatriate any of the earnings represented by non cash operating asset such inventory and fixed asset we might incur incremental non tax which could affect our result of operation our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected if customer or distributor suffers loss with respect to our inventory we have consignment inventory program in place for some of our largest customer and distributor if customer or distributor to experience loss with respect to ti consigned inventory our result of operation and financial condition may be adversely affected if we do not recover the full value of the lost inventory from the customer distributor or insurer or if our recovery is delayed our result of operation could be adversely affected by our distributor promotion of competing product line or our distributor financial performance in about percent of our revenue wa generated from sale of our product through distributor our distributor carry competing product line and our sale could be affected if our distributor promote competing product over our product moreover our result of operation could be affected if our distributor suffer financial difficulty that result in their inability to pay amount owed to dispute with or the loss of significant number of distributor could be disruptive or harmful to our current business our margin may vary over time our profit margin may be adversely affected by number of factor including decrease in customer demand and shipment volume obsolescence of our inventory shift in our product mix change in tariff change in our manufacturing process and new accounting pronouncement or change in existing accounting practice or standard in addition we operate in highly competitive market environment that might adversely affect pricing for our product because we own much of our manufacturing capacity significant portion of our operating cost is fixed in general these fixed cost do not decline with reduction in customer demand or factory loading and can adversely affect profit margin result our performance depends in part on our ability to enforce our intellectual property right and to maintain freedom of operation access to worldwide market depends in part on the continued strength of our intellectual property portfolio in all jurisdiction where we conduct business there can be no assurance that our business evolves we will obtain the necessary intellectual property right or that we will be able to independently develop the technology software or know how necessary to conduct our business or that we can do without infringing the intellectual property right of others to the extent that we have to rely on licensed technology from others there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain license at all or on term we consider reasonable we may directly or indirectly face infringement claim from third party including non practicing entity that have acquired patent to pursue enforcement action against other company we may also face infringement claim where we or our customer make use or sell product and where the intellectual property law may be le established or le predictable these assertion whether or not of any merit could expose to claim for damage and or injunction from third party well claim for indemnification by our customer in instance where we have contractual or other legal obligation to indemnify them against damage resulting from infringement claim we actively enforce and protect our own intellectual property right however our effort can not prevent all misappropriation or improper use of our protected technology and information including for example third party use of our patented or copyrighted technology or our trade secret in their product without the right to do so or third party sale of counterfeit product bearing our trademark the risk of unfair copying or cloning may impede our ability to sell our product the law of country where we operate may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent law our debt could affect our operation and financial condition from time to time we issue debt security with various interest rate and maturity we believe we will have the ability to service this debt our ability to make principal and interest payment when due depends upon our future performance which will be subject to general economic condition industry cycle and business and other factor affecting our operation including our other risk factor many of which are beyond our control in addition our obligation to make principal and interest payment could divert fund that otherwise would be invested in our operation or returned to shareholder or could cause to raise fund by for example issuing new debt or equity or selling asset our result of operation and liquidity could be affected by change in the financial market we maintain bank account one or more multi year revolving credit agreement and portfolio of investment to support the financing need of the company our ability to fund our operation invest in our business make strategic acquisition service our debt obligation and meet our cash return objective depends upon continuous access to our bank and investment account and may depend on access to our bank credit line that support commercial paper borrowing and provide additional liquidity through short term bank loan if we are unable to access these account and credit line for example due to instability in the financial market our result of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected and our ability to access the capital market or redeem our investment could be restricted increase in health care and pension benefit cost could affect our result of operation and financial condition federal and state health care reform program could increase our cost with regard to medical coverage of our employee which could reduce profitability and affect our result of operation and financial condition in addition obligation related to our pension and other postretirement plan reflect assumption that affect the planned funding and cost of these plan including the actual return on plan asset discount rate plan participant population demographic and change in pension regulation change in these assumption may affect plan funding cash flow and result of operation and our cost and funding obligation could increase significantly if our plan actual experience differs from these assumption our continued success depends in part on our ability to retain and recruit sufficient number of qualified employee in competitive environment our continued success depends in part on the retention and recruitment of skilled personnel including engineering management marketing technical and staff personnel skilled and experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talent is intense there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully retain and recruit the key engineering management and technical personnel that we require to execute our business strategy our ability to recruit internationally or deploy employee to various location may be limited by immigration law our ability to successfully implement business and organizational change could affect our business plan and result of operation from time to time we undertake business and organizational change including acquisition divestiture and restructuring action to support or carry our strategic objective our failure to successfully implement these change could adversely affect our business plan and operating result for example we may not realize the expected benefit of an acquisition if we are unable to timely and successfully integrate acquired operation product line and technology and our pre acquisition due diligence may not identify all possible issue and risk that might arise with respect to an acquisition further we may not achieve or sustain the expected growth or cost saving benefit of business and organizational change and restructuring charge could differ materially in amount and timing from our expectation material impairment of our goodwill or intangible asset could adversely affect our result of operation we have significant amount of goodwill and intangible asset on our consolidated balance sheet charge associated with impairment of goodwill or intangible asset could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation item unresolved staff comment not applicable item property our principal executive office are

discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and financial statement and supplementary data item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation overview we design make and sell semiconductor to electronics designer and manufacturer all over the world our business model is designed around the following four sustainable competitive advantage that we believe in combination put in unique class of company strong foundation of manufacturing and technology we invest in manufacturing technology and do most of our manufacturing in house this strategic decision to directly control our manufacturing help ensure consistent supply of product for our customer and also allows to invest in technology that differentiates the feature of our product we have focused on creating competitive manufacturing cost advantage by increasing factory loading of our advanced analog millimeter wafer which have about percent cost advantage per unpackaged chip over millimeter wafer millimeter wafer will support the majority of our analog growth going forward additionally we keep our manufacturing cost low by using mature asset acquired ahead of demand when their price are most attractive broad portfolio of differentiated analog and embedded processing semiconductor our customer need multiple chip for their system the breadth of our portfolio mean we can solve more of these need than our competitor which give access to more customer and the opportunity to sell more product and generate more revenue per customer system we invest more than billion each year to develop new product for our portfolio which includes ten of thousand of product broadest reach of market channel customer often begin their initial product selection process and design in journey on our website and the breadth of our portfolio attracts more customer to our website than any of our competitor our web presence combined with our global sale force that is also greater in size than those of our competitor are advantage that give unique access to about customer designing ti semiconductor into their end product diversity and longevity of our product market and customer position together the attribute result in diverse and long lived position that deliver high terminal value to our shareholder because of the breadth of our portfolio we are not dependent on any single product and because of the breadth of our market we are not dependent on any single application or customer some of our product generate revenue for decade which strengthens the return on our investment our strategic focus and where we invest the majority of our resource is on analog and embedded processing with particular emphasis on designing and selling those product into the industrial and automotive market which we believe represent the best growth opportunity analog and embedded processing product sold into industrial and automotive market provide long product life cycle intrinsic diversity and le capital intensive manufacturing which we believe offer stability profitability and strong cash generation this business model is the foundation of our capital management strategy which is based on our belief that free cash flow growth especially on per share basis is important for maximizing shareholder value over the long term we also believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to shareholder the combined effect of these sustainable competitive advantage is that over time we have gained market share in analog and embedded processing and have grown free cash flow our business model put in unique class of company with the ability to grow generate cash and return that cash to shareholder management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation md should be read in conjunction with the financial statement and the related note that appear elsewhere in this document in the following discussion of our result of operation our segment represent group of similar product that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirement product characteristic manufacturing process and distribution channel and how management allocates resource and measure result see note to the financial statement for more information regarding our segment all dollar amount in the table are stated in million of dollar when we discus our result unless otherwise noted change in our revenue are attributable to change in customer demand which are evidenced by fluctuation in shipment volume new product tend not to have significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such large number of product from time to time our revenue and gross profit are affected by change in demand for higher priced or lower priced product which we refer to change in the mix of product shipped because we own much of our manufacturing capacity significant portion of our operating cost is fixed when factory loading decrease our fixed cost are spread over reduced output and absent other circumstance our profit margin decrease conversely factory loading increase our fixed cost are spread over increased output and absent other circumstance our profit margin increase increase and decrease in factory loading tend to correspond to increase and decrease in demand over time we have been allocating resource from area like manufacturing support and sg into activity the recently enacted tax cut and job act the tax act will reduce our annual operating tax rate which not include discrete tax item from percent in to an ongoing rate of about percent starting in comprehending the benefit of export and having manufacturing and intellectual property in the united state in our annual operating tax rate is expected to be about percent percentage point higher primarily due to transitional non cash expense for an explanation of the term annual operating tax rate see the non gaap financial information section after the liquidity and capital resource section in the first quarter of we adopted asu related to certain pension and other retiree benefit cost we applied the new standard on full retrospective basis for all period presented in the consolidated statement of income which have been recast result see note to the financial statement for more detail of january we no longer recognize royalty revenue instead they are recorded oi we continue to receive royalty from arrangement involving license right to our patent portfolio although we expect royalty to continue for many year they are of decreasing significance to our core operation result of operation we continued to perform well in reflecting our focus on analog and embedded processing with particular emphasis on the industrial and automotive market these product serve highly diverse market with thousand of application and have long term growth opportunity in analog and embedded processing represented percent of revenue gross margin of percent reflected the quality of our product portfolio well the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy

other business requirement for at least the next month in we recorded provisional tax liability of million on indefinitely reinvested earnings of our non subsidiary related to the enactment of the tax act this amount will be paid over eight year and is not expected to have significant impact on our liquidity non gaap financial information this md includes reference to free cash flow and ratio based on that measure these are financial measure that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the united state gaap free cash flow wa calculated by subtracting capital expenditure from the most directly comparable gaap measure cash flow from operating activity also referred to cash flow from operation we believe that free cash flow and the associated ratio provide insight into our liquidity our cash generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholder well insight into our financial performance these non gaap measure are supplemental to the comparable gaap measure reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap based measure is provided in the table below for year ended december cash flow from operation gaap capital expenditure free cash flow non gaap revenue cash flow from operation percent of revenue gaap free cash flow percent of revenue non gaap this md also includes reference to an annual operating tax rate non gaap term we use to describe the estimated annual effective tax rate gaap measure that by definition doe not include discrete tax item we believe the term annual operating tax rate more clearly communicates that discrete tax item are excluded from such rate the term also help differentiate from the effective tax rate which includes discrete tax item no adjustment are made to the estimated annual effective tax rate when using the term annual operating tax rate long term contractual obligation payment due by period contractual obligation thereafter total long term debt purchase commitment tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings operating lease deferred compensation plan total includes the related interest payment and amount classified the current portion of long term debt specifically obligation that will mature within month includes payment for software license and contractual arrangement with supplier where there is fixed non cancellable payment schedule or minimum payment due with reduced delivery schedule excluded from the table are cancellable arrangement includes the provisional amount of the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings related to the enactment of the tax act see note to the financial statement for more detail includes minimum payment for leased facility and equipment and purchase of industrial gas under contract accounted for operating lease includes an estimate of payment for certain liability that existed at december excluded from the table are million of uncertain tax liability under asc well any planned future funding contribution to retirement benefit plan amount associated with uncertain tax liability have been excluded because of the difficulty in making reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority regarding future funding of retirement benefit plan we plan to contribute about million in but funding projection beyond are not practical to estimate due to the rule affecting tax deductible contribution and the impact from the plan asset performance interest rate and potential and non legislation critical accounting policy our accounting policy are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statement disclosed in note the preparation of consolidated financial statement in conformity with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make estimate and assumption about future event that affect the amount reported in the financial statement and accompanying note however based on fact and circumstance inherent in developing estimate and assumption management belief it is unlikely that applying other estimate and assumption would have material impact on the financial statement we consider the following accounting policy to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and that require higher degree of judgment revenue recognition based on management assessment of the revenue recognition criterion we usually recognize revenue from sale of our product to distributor upon shipment or delivery to the distributor for our consignment arrangement with distributor delivery occurs when the distributor pull product from consignment inventory that we store at designated location recognition is not contingent upon resale of the product to the distributor customer in either scenario revenue is recognized net of allowance which are management estimate of future credit to be granted to distributor under program common in the semiconductor industry these allowance are not material and generally include special pricing arrangement product return due to quality issue and incentive designed to maximize growth opportunity allowance are based on analysis of historical data and contractual term and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowance for credit to distributor in timely manner income tax in determining net income for financial statement purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment in the calculation of tax provision and the resultant tax liability and in the recoverability of deferred tax asset that arise from temporary difference the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense in the ordinary course of global business there may be many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain the calculation of tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law we recognize potential liability for anticipated tax audit issue in the united state and other tax jurisdiction based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether and the extent to which additional tax will be due although we believe the estimate are reasonable no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matter will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provision and accrual part of our financial process we must ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset can be recovered if recovery is not likely the provision for tax must be increased by recording reserve in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable in this process certain relevant criterion are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liability that can be used to absorb deferred tax asset the taxable income in prior year that can be used to absorb net operating loss and credit carrybacks and taxable income in future year our judgment regarding future recoverability of our deferred tax asset based on these criterion may change due to various factor including change in or international tax law and change in market condition and their impact on our assessment of taxable income in future period these change if any may require material adjustment to the deferred tax asset and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determination are made also our plan for the permanent reinvestment or eventual repatriation of the accumulated earnings of certain non operation could change such change could have material effect on tax expense in future year inventory valuation allowance inventory is valued net of allowance for unsalable or obsolete raw material work in process and finished good statistical allowance are determined quarterly for raw material and work in process based on historical disposal of inventory for salability and obsolescence reason for finished good quarterly statistical allowance are determined by comparing inventory level of individual part to historical shipment current backlog and estimated future sale in order to identify inventory judged unlikely to be sold specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is significant event not captured by the statistical allowance example are an end of life part or demand with imminent risk of cancellation allowance are also calculated quarterly for instance where inventoried cost for individual product are in excess of market price for those product actual future write offs of inventory for salability and obsolescence reason may differ from estimate and calculation used to determine valuation allowance due to change in customer demand customer negotiation technology shift and other factor change in accounting standard see note to the financial statement for information on new accounting standard off balance sheet arrangement of december we had no significant off balance sheet arrangement defined in item ii of sec regulation commitment and contingency see note to the financial statement for discussion of our commitment and contingency item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign exchange risk the dollar is the functional currency for financial reporting our non entity own asset or liability denominated in dollar or other currency exchange rate fluctuation can have significant impact on taxable income in those jurisdiction and consequently on our effective tax rate our balance sheet also reflects amount remeasured from non dollar currency because most of the aggregate non dollar balance sheet exposure is hedged by forward currency exchange contract based on year end balance and currency exchange rate hypothetical percent plus or minus fluctuation in non currency exchange rate relative to the dollar would result in pre tax currency exchange gain or loss of about million we use these forward currency exchange contract to reduce the earnings impact exchange rate fluctuation may have on our non dollar net balance sheet exposure for example at year end we had forward currency exchange contract outstanding with notional value of million to hedge net balance sheet exposure including million to sell japanese yen million to sell british pound sterling and million to sell euro similar hedging activity existed at year end interest rate risk we have the following potential exposure to change in interest rate the effect of change in interest rate on the fair value of our investment in cash equivalent and short term investment which could produce gain or loss and the effect of change in interest rate on the fair value of our debt of december hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would decrease the fair value of our investment in cash equivalent and short term investment by million and decrease the fair value of our long term debt by million because interest rate on our long term debt are fixed change in interest rate would not affect the cash flow associated with long term debt equity risk long term investment at year end include the following investment in mutual fund includes mutual fund that were selected to generate return that offset change in certain liability related to deferred compensation arrangement the mutual fund hold variety of debt and equity investment investment in venture capital fund includes investment in limited partnership accounted for under either the equity or cost method equity investment includes non marketable non publicly traded equity security investment in mutual fund are stated at fair value change in price of the mutual fund investment are expected to offset related change in deferred compensation liability such that percent increase or decrease in the investment fair value would not materially affect operating result non marketable equity security

segment and geographic area information we design make and sell semiconductor to electronics designer and manufacturer all over the world beginning january we reorganized the product line within our reportable segment analog and embedded processing to align our business structure with the way our customer select and buy product these change had no effect on either our previously reported consolidated financial statement or our reportable segment amount our two reportable segment are established along major category of product follows analog consisting of the following product line power signal chain and high volume embedded processing consisting of the following product line connected microcontrollers and processor we report the result of our remaining business activity in other other includes operating segment that do not meet the quantitative threshold for individually reportable segment and can not be aggregated with other operating segment other includes dlp product calculator and custom asic product of january we no longer recognize royalty revenue instead they are recorded oi prior period amount were not material in other we also include item that are not used in evaluating the result of or in allocating resource to our segment example of these item include acquisition charge see note restructuring charge see note and certain corporate level item such litigation expense environmental cost insurance settlement and gain and loss from other activity including asset disposition we allocate the remainder of our expense associated with corporate activity to our operating segment based on specific methodology such percentage of operating expense or headcount our centralized manufacturing and support organization such facility procurement and logistics provide support to our operating segment including those in other cost incurred by these organization including depreciation are charged to the segment on per unit basis consequently depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segment result and therefore is not provided with the exception of goodwill we do not identify or allocate asset by operating segment doe the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segment using discrete asset information we have no material intersegment revenue the accounting policy of the segment are the same those described below in the summary of significant accounting policy and practice segment information for year ended december revenue analog embedded processing other total revenue operating profit analog embedded processing other total operating profit operating profit in the prior period ha been recast result of our early adoption of new accounting standard related to pension and other retiree benefit cost see note for additional information geographic area information the following geographic area information includes revenue based on product shipment destination and property plant and equipment based on physical location the revenue information is not necessarily indicative of the geographic area in which the end application containing our product are ultimately consumed because our product tend to be shipped to the location where our customer manufacture their product specifically many of our product are shipped to our customer in china may include these part in the manufacture of their own end product which they may in turn export to their customer around the world for year ended december revenue united state asia europe middle east and africa japan rest of world total revenue revenue from product shipped into china including hong kong wa billion in billion in and billion in december property plant and equipment united state asia europe middle east and africa japan rest of world total property plant and equipment property plant and equipment at our two site in the philippine wa million million and million of december and respectively basis of presentation and significant accounting policy and practice basis of presentation the consolidated financial statement have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap the basis of these financial statement is comparable for all period presented herein except for the adoption of new accounting standard in related to stock compensation which included certain provision applied prospectively the consolidated financial statement include the account of all subsidiary all intercompany balance and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation all dollar amount in the financial statement and table in these note except per share amount are stated in million of dollar unless otherwise indicated we have reclassified certain amount in the prior period financial statement to conform to the presentation retrospectively applying the new accounting standard related to pension and other retiree benefit cost see change in accounting standard adopted standard for current period for further information the preparation of financial statement requires the use of estimate from which final result may vary significant accounting policy and practice revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sale of our product including sale to our distributor when title and risk of loss pas which usually occurs upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor depending upon the term of the sale order when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when sale amount are fixed or determinable and when collectability is reasonably assured for sale to distributor payment is due on our standard commercial term and is not contingent upon resale of the product revenue from sale of our product that are subject to inventory consignment agreement including consignment arrangement with distributor is recognized in accordance with the principle discussed above delivery occurs when the customer or distributor pull product from consignment inventory that we store at designated location we recognize revenue net of allowance which are management estimate of future credit to be granted to customer or distributor under program common in the semiconductor industry these allowance which are not material generally include special pricing arrangement product return due to quality issue and incentive designed to maximize growth opportunity allowance are based on analysis of historical data and contractual term and are recorded when revenue is recognized we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowance for credit to distributor in timely manner in addition we record allowance for account receivable that we estimate may not be collected we monitor collectability of account receivable primarily through review of the account receivable aging when collection is at risk we ass the impact on amount recorded for bad debt and if necessary will record charge in the period such determination is made we recognize in revenue shipping fee if any received from customer we include shipping and handling cost in cor the majority of our customer pay these fee directly to third party advertising cost we expense advertising and other promotional cost incurred this expense wa million in million in and million in income tax we account for income tax using an asset and liability approach we record the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax asset and liability for future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in the financial statement or tax return we record valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized other assessed tax some transaction require to collect tax such sale value added and excise tax from our customer these transaction are presented in our consolidated statement of income on net excluded from revenue basis earnings per share eps unvested share based payment award that contain non forfeitable right to receive dividend or dividend equivalent such our restricted stock unit rsus are considered to be participating security and the two class method is used for purpose of calculating eps under the two class method portion of net income is allocated to these participating security and therefore is excluded from the calculation of eps allocated to common stock shown in the table below computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are follows share in million for year ended december net net net income share eps income share eps income share eps basic eps net income income allocated to rsus income allocated to common stock for basic eps calculation adjustment for dilutive share stock compensation plan diluted eps net income income allocated to rsus income allocated to common stock for diluted eps calculation potentially dilutive security representing million and million share of common stock that were outstanding in and respectively were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share for these period because their effect would have been anti dilutive no potentially dilutive security were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during investment we present investment on our consolidated balance sheet cash equivalent short term investment or long term investment which are detailed follows cash equivalent and short term investment we consider investment in debt security with maturity of day or le from the date of our investment to be cash equivalent we consider investment in debt security with maturity beyond day from the date of our investment being available for use in current operation and include them in short term investment the primary objective of our cash equivalent and short term investment activity are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity while generating appropriate return long term investment long term investment consist of mutual fund venture capital fund and non marketable equity security classification of investment depending on our reason for holding the investment and our ownership percentage we classify our investment either available for sale trading equity method or cost method which are more fully described in note we determine cost or amortized cost appropriate on specific identification basis inventory inventory are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value cost is generally computed on currently adjusted standard cost basis which approximates cost on first in first out basis standard cost is based on the normal utilization of installed factory capacity cost associated with underutilization of capacity is expensed incurred inventory held at consignment location is included in our finished good inventory consigned inventory wa million and million of december and respectively we review inventory quarterly for salability and obsolescence statistical allowance is provided for inventory considered unlikely to be sold the statistical allowance is based on an analysis of historical disposal activity historical customer shipment well estimated future sale specific allowance for each material type will be carried if there is significant event not captured by the statistical allowance we write off inventory in the period in which disposal occurs property plant and equipment acquisition related intangible and other capitalized cost property plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful life using the straight line method our cost basis includes certain asset acquired in business combination that were initially recorded at fair value of the date of acquisition leasehold improvement are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life of the improvement we amortize acquisition related intangible on straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the asset capitalized software license generally are amortized on straight line basis over the term of the license fully depreciated or amortized asset are written off against accumulated depreciation or amortization impairment of long lived asset we regularly review whether fact or circumstance exist that indicate the carrying value of property plant and equipment or other long lived asset including intangible asset are impaired we ass the recoverability of asset by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flow associated with those asset to their respective carrying amount any impairment charge is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those asset fair value is determined by available market valuation if applicable or by discounted cash flow goodwill and indefinite lived intangible goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if certain impairment indicator arise we perform our annual goodwill impairment test of october for our reporting unit which compare the fair value for each reporting unit to it associated carrying value including goodwill see note for additional information foreign currency the functional currency for our non subsidiary is the dollar account recorded in currency other than the dollar are remeasured into the functional currency current asset except inventory deferred tax other asset current liability and long term liability are remeasured at exchange rate in effect at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment with associated depreciation and inventory are valued at historical exchange rate revenue and expense account other than depreciation for each month are remeasured at the appropriate daily rate of exchange currency exchange gain and loss from remeasurement are credited or charged to oi derivative and hedging we use derivative financial instrument to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk these instrument are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contract which are used economic hedge to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuation may have on our non dollar net balance sheet exposure gain and loss from change in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contract are credited or charged to oi we do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instrument in connection with the issuance of long term debt we may use financial derivative such treasury rate lock agreement that are recognized in aoci and amortized over the life of the related debt the result of these derivative transaction have not been material we do not use derivative for speculative or trading purpose change in accounting standard adopted standard for current period accounting standard update asu no income tax topic intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory this standard requires current and deferred tax resulting from the intra entity transfer of any asset other than inventory to be recognized for financial reporting purpose when the transfer occurs rather than postpone recognition until the asset ha been sold to an outside party currently allowed this standard is required to be applied on modified retrospective basis through cumulative effect adjustment directly to retained earnings and is effective for interim and annual period beginning january we elected to adopt this standard in the first quarter of the effect on our financial position and result of operation wa not material asu no compensation retirement benefit topic improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost this standard amends the income statement presentation of the component of net periodic benefit cost for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan this standard requires to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other component of net periodic benefit cost the other component and present it in the same line item on the statement of income other current compensation cost for related employee and present the other component outside of operating profit in oi this standard is required to be applied retrospectively and is effective for interim and annual period beginning january we elected to adopt this standard of january adoption of this standard not impact

recast reported recast cor gross profit sg operating profit analog embedded processing other total operating profit oi change in accounting standard standard not yet adopted asu no revenue from contract with customer topic this standard provides single set of guideline for revenue recognition to be used across all industry and requires additional disclosure which we are currently evaluating it is effective for interim and annual reporting period beginning january this standard permit early adoption and the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method we plan on adopting this standard using the cumulative effect modified retrospective transition method which will result in an adjustment to retained earnings for the cumulative effect of applying this guidance to contract in process of january under this approach we will not restate the prior financial statement presented based on our current assessment we do not expect the new standard to have material impact on our financial position and result of operation it is not expected to materially change the manner or timing in which we recognize revenue we recognize revenue on sale to customer and distributor upon satisfaction of our performance obligation when the good are shipped for consignment sale we recognize revenue when the good are pulled from consignment inventory beginning january we no longer recognize in revenue royalty income from licensing our patent portfolio however we are still required to apply the recognition measurement and disclosure provision of this new standard to our royalty income we believe the most significant impact of the new standard will be to accelerate the timing of recognizing royalty income in oi although the effect of such change on the result of operation and financial position recognized in any individual reporting period is not expected to be material this change will have no effect on the recognition and timing of cash flow over any affected period asu no lease topic this standard requires all lease that have term of over month to be recognized on the balance sheet with the liability for lease payment and the corresponding right of use asset initially measured at the present value of amount expected to be paid over the term recognition of the cost of these lease on the income statement will be dependent upon their classification either an operating or financing lease cost of an operating lease will continue to be recognized single operating expense on straight line basis over the lease term cost for financing lease will be disaggregated and recognized both an operating expense for the amortization of the right of use asset and interest expense for interest on the lease liability this standard will be effective for our interim and annual period beginning january and must be applied on modified retrospective basis to lease existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statement we do not plan to adopt this standard early we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard on our financial position but we do not expect it to have material impact on our result of operation asu no financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument this standard requires entity to use current lifetime expected credit loss methodology to measure impairment of certain financial asset using this methodology will result in earlier recognition of loss than under the current incurred loss approach which requires waiting to recognize loss until it is probable of having been incurred there are other provision within the standard that affect how impairment of other financial asset may be recorded and presented and that expand disclosure this standard will be effective for our interim and annual period beginning january and permit earlier application but not before period beginning january the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this standard but we do not expect it to have material impact on our

dividend rate and the current market price of our common stock at the time of grant no assumption for future dividend rate change is included unless there is an approved plan to change the dividend in the near term the fair value per share of rsus is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant our employee stock purchase plan is discount purchase plan and

and liability we remeasured deferred tax asset and liability based on the statutory income tax rate of percent however we are still analyzing certain aspect of the tax act and refining our calculation

future period in which the tax arises the earnings represented by non cash operating asset such fixed asset and certain inventory will continue to be permanently reinvested outside the united state the tax on indefinitely reinvested earnings eliminates any additional taxation of these earnings upon repatriation to the united state consequently no tax provision ha been made for the future

index fund measured at net asset value per share the investment in our major benefit plan largely consist of low cost broad market index fund to mitigate risk of concentration within market sector our investment policy is designed to better match the interest rate sensitivity of the plan asset and liability the appropriate mix of equity and bond investment is determined primarily through the use of detailed asset liability modeling study that look to balance the impact of change in the discount rate against the need to provide asset growth to cover future service cost most of our plan around the world have greater proportion of fixed income security with return characteristic that are more closely aligned with change in the liability caused by discount rate volatility for the plan we utilize an option collar strategy to reduce the volatility of return on investment in equity fund the only level asset in our worldwide benefit plan for the period presented is diversified property fund in non pension plan these investment are valued using input from the fund manager and internal model change to the fair value of this fund since december have not been material and are due to redemption assumption and investment policy retiree non defined benefit health care defined benefit weighted average assumption used to determine benefit obligation discount rate long term pay progression weighted average assumption used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate long term rate of return on plan asset long term pay progression we utilize variety of method to select an appropriate discount rate depending on the depth of the corporate bond market in the country in which the benefit plan operates in the united state we use settlement approach whereby portfolio of bond is selected from the universe of actively traded high quality corporate bond the selected portfolio is designed to provide cash flow sufficient to pay the plan expected benefit payment when due the resulting discount rate reflects the rate of return of the selected portfolio of bond for our non location with sufficient number of actively traded high quality bond an analysis is performed in which the projected cash flow from the defined benefit plan are discounted against yield curve constructed with an appropriate universe of high quality corporate bond available in each country in this manner present value is developed the discount rate selected is the single equivalent rate that produce the same present value for country that lack sufficient corporate bond market government bond index adjusted for an appropriate risk premium is used to establish the discount rate assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan asset are based on future expectation for return for each asset class and the effect of periodic target asset allocation rebalancing we adjust the result for the payment of reasonable expense of the plan from plan asset we believe our assumption are appropriate based on the investment mix and long term nature of the plan investment assumption used for the non defined benefit plan reflect the different economic environment within the various
