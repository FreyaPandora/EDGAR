sense of belonging and are fully engaged in our success item risk factorsin addition to the other information set forth in this document including the matter contained under the caption cautionary language concerning forward looking statement you should carefully read the matter described below we believe that each of these matter could materially affect our business we recognize that most of these factor are beyond our ability to control and therefore we can not predict an outcome macro economic factor adverse change in the security market interest rate rising inflation and medical cost could materially increase our benefit plan cost and future funding requirement our cost to provide current benefit and funding for future benefit are subject to increase primarily due to continuing increase in medical and prescription drug cost in part due to inflation and can be affected by lower return on asset held by our pension and other benefit plan which are reflected in our financial statement for that year in calculating the recognized benefit cost we have made certain assumption regarding future investment return interest rate and medical cost these assumption could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected lower than assumed investment return an increase in our benefit obligation and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug cost will increase expense the financial accounting standard board fasb requires company to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize change in that funded status in the year in which the change occur we have elected to reflect the annual adjustment to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income therefore an increase in our cost or adverse market condition will have negative effect on our operating result significant adverse change in capital market could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plan funded status inflationary pressure on cost such input for device we sell and network component labor and distribution cost may impact our network construction our financial condition or result of operation provider of telecommunication and technology service we sell handset wireless data card wireless computing device and customer premise equipment manufactured by various supplier for use with our voice and data service and depend on supplier to provide directly or through other supplier with item such network equipment customer premise equipment and wireless related equipment such mobile hotspot handset wirelessly enabled computer wireless data card and other connected device for our customer beginning in and continuing through the early part of the cost of these input and the cost of labor necessary to develop deploy and maintain our network and our product and service rapidly increased in addition many of these input are subject to price fluctuation from number of factor including but not limited to market condition demand for raw material used in the production of these device and network component weather climate change energy cost currency fluctuation supplier capacity governmental action import and export requirement including tariff and other factor beyond our control inflationary and supply pressure may continue into the future and could have an adverse impact on our ability to source material our attempt to offset these cost pressure such through increase in the selling price of some of our product and service may not be successful higher product price may result in reduction in sale volume consumer may be le willing to pay price differential for our product and may increasingly purchase lower priced offering or may forego some purchase altogether during period of inflationary pressure or an economic downturn to the extent that price increase are not sufficient to offset these increased cost adequately or in timely manner and or if they result in significant decrease in sale volume our business financial condition or operating result may be adversely affected furthermore we may not be able to offset any cost increase through productivity and cost saving initiative inc dollar in million except per share amountsadverse change in global financial market could limit our ability and our larger customer ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operation during uncertainty surrounding global growth rate inflation an increasing interest rate environment and the impact of the covid pandemic continued to produce volatility in the credit currency and equity market volatility may affect company access to the credit market leading to higher borrowing cost or in some case the inability to fund ongoing operation in addition we contract with large financial institution to support our own treasury operation including contract to hedge our exposure on interest rate and foreign exchange and the funding of credit line and other short term debt obligation including commercial paper these financial institution face stricter capital related and other regulation in the united state and europe well ongoing legal and financial issue concerning their loan portfolio which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit the financial conduct authority which regulates the london interbank offering rate libor ha announced that it intends to phase libor in although our security and other debt obligation may provide for alternative method of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty to the extent and manner of future change may adversely affect the current trading market for libor based security and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general company cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluation given by various credit rating agency and these agency have been applying tighter credit standard when evaluating debt level and future growth prospect while we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income market when needed adverse change in the financial market could render either unable to access these market or able to access these market only at higher interest cost and with restrictive financial or other condition severely affecting our business operation additionally downgrade of our credit rating by the major credit rating agency could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreement we have entered into with our derivative counterparties which could negatively impact our liquidity further valuation change in our derivative portfolio due to interest rate and foreign exchange rate could require to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity our international operation increase our exposure to political instability to change in the international economy and to regulation on our business and these risk could offset our expected growth opportunity we have international operation particularly in mexico and other country worldwide where we need to comply with wide variety of complex local law regulation and treaty in addition we are exposed to among other factor fluctuation in currency value change in relationship between and foreign government war or other hostility and other regulation that may materially affect our earnings involvement with foreign firm also expose to the risk of being unable to control the action of those firm and therefore expose to risk associated with our obligation to comply with the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa violation of the fcpa could have material adverse effect on our operating result industry wide factor our business is subject to risk related to the covid virus the covid pandemic and resulting mitigation measure have caused and may continue to cause negative effect on our operating result these effect include but are not limited to closure of retail store impact on our customer ability to pay for our product and service reduction in international roaming revenue and reduced staffing level in call center and field operation we may also incur significantly higher expense attributable to infrastructure investment required to meet higher network utilization from more customer consuming bandwidth from change in work from home trend extended cancellation period and increased labor cost if the covid pandemic continues for an extended period the covid pandemic and mitigation measure have caused and may continue to cause adverse impact on global supply chain and economic condition these impact could affect our network development deployment and maintenance and the demand for our product and service the extent to which the covid pandemic impact our business result of operation cash flow and financial condition will depend on future development that are highly uncertain and can not be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning other strain of the virus and the action to contain it impact change to federal state and foreign government regulation and decision in regulatory proceeding well private litigation could further increase our operating cost and or alter customer perception of our operation which could materially adversely affect our subsidiary providing wired service are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitor are not in addition our subsidiary and affiliate operating outside the united state are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authority in the market where service is provided our wireless subsidiary are regulated to varying degree by the fcc and in some instance by state and local agency adverse regulation and ruling by the fcc relating to broadband and wireless deployment could impede our ability to manage our network and recover cost and lessen incentive to invest in our network the continuing growth of ip based service especially when accessed by wireless inc dollar in million except per share amountsdevices ha created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authority which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcome unfavorable to in addition in response to the faa questioning whether our band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplane we voluntarily committed to series of temporary precautionary measure in addition to deferring turning on limited number of tower around certain airport to allow the faa more time to evaluate these measure have been subsequently modified from time to time the faa continued evaluation may impact our planned band launch in certain area in addition increased public focus on variety of issue related to our operation such privacy issue government request or order for customer data and concern about global climate change have led to proposal or new legislation at state federal and foreign government level to change or increase regulation on our operation enactment of new privacy law and regulation could among other thing adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisement or result in additional cost of compliance or litigation should customer decide that our competitor offer more customer friendly environment our competitive position result of operation or financial condition could be materially adversely affected effect of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure our ability to provide service and may cause change in federal state and foreign government regulation all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial result extreme weather event precipitated by long term climate change have the potential to directly damage network facility or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portion of our network and could potentially disrupt supplier ability to provide product and service required to provide reliable network coverage any such disruption could delay network deployment plan interrupt service for our customer increase our cost and have negative effect on our operating result the potential physical effect of climate change such increased frequency and severity of storm flood fire freezing condition sea level rise and other climate related event could adversely affect our operation infrastructure and financial result operational impact resulting from the potential physical effect of climate change such damage to our network infrastructure could result in increased cost and loss of revenue we could incur significant cost to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for respond to and mitigate such physical effect of climate change we are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential loss or cost associated with the physical effect of climate change further customer consumer investor and other stakeholder are increasingly focusing on environmental issue including climate change water use deforestation plastic waste and other sustainability concern concern over climate change or other environmental social and governance esg matter may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirement to reduce or mitigate impact to the environment and reduce the impact of our business on climate change further climate change regulation may require to alter our proposed business plan or increase our operating cost due to increased regulation or environmental consideration and could adversely affect our business and reputation continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband service will require to deploy significant amount of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive service to customer wireless and broadband service are undergoing rapid and significant technological change and dramatic increase in usage including in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of data including video across mobile and fixed device the covid pandemic ha accelerated these change and also resulted in higher network utilization more customer consume bandwidth from change in work and learn from home trend we must continually invest in our network in order to improve our wireless and broadband service to meet this increasing demand and change in customer expectation while remaining competitive improvement in these service depend on many factor including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these service in order to stem broadband subscriber loss to cable competitor in our non fiber wireline area we have been expanding our all fiber wireline network we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data including video and voice between cell and fixed landline site to this end we participate in spectrum auction and continue to deploy software and other technology advancement in order to efficiently invest in our network we have spent and plan to continue spending significant capital and other resource on the ongoing development and deployment of our and fiber wireline network this deployment and other network service enhancement and product launch may not occur scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factor including unexpected inflation delay in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standard supplier delay software issue increase in network and handset component cost regulatory permitting delay for tower site or enhancement or labor related delay deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing service if we can not acquire needed spectrum our and fiber offering fail to gain acceptance in the marketplace or we otherwise fail to deploy the service customer desire on timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable cost our ability to attract and retain customer and therefore maintain and improve our operating margin could be materially adversely affected inc dollar in million except per share amountsincreasing competition for wireless customer could materially adversely affect our operating result we have multiple wireless competitor in each of our service area and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network quality coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from provider offering service using advanced wireless technology and ip based network we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rate leading to increased competition for customer our share of industry sale could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or promotional strategy pursued by competitor we also expect that our customer growing demand for high speed video and data service will place constraint on our network capacity these competition and capacity constraint will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to respond will depend among other thing on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our product and service competitively well effective marketing of attractive product and service these effort will involve significant expense and require strategic management decision on and timely implementation of equipment choice network deployment and service offering intellectual property right may be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunity which may materially adversely affect our operation effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate we may need to spend significant amount of money to protect our right any impairment of our intellectual property right including due to change in or foreign intellectual property law or the absence of effective legal protection or enforcement measure could materially adversely impact our operation incident leading to damage to our reputation and any resulting lawsuit claim or other legal proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business we believe that our brand image awareness and reputation strengthen our relationship with consumer and contribute significantly to the success of our business we strive to create culture in which our colleague act with integrity and respect and feel comfortable speaking up to report instance of misconduct or other concern our ability to attract and retain employee is highly dependent upon our commitment to diverse and inclusive workplace ethical business practice and other quality act of misconduct by any employee and particularly by senior management could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct by or those currently or formerly associated with and from any number of activity or circumstance including operation employment related offense such sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and action taken by regulator or others in response to such conduct any damage to our reputation or payment of significant amount even if reserved could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition result of operation and cash flow we currently are and may in the future be named defendant in lawsuit claim and other legal proceeding that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged act of misconduct by employee these action seek among other thing compensation for alleged personal injury including claim for loss of life worker compensation employment discrimination sexual harassment workplace misconduct wage and hour claim and other employment related damage compensation for breach of contract statutory or regulatory claim negligence or gross negligence punitive damage consequential damage and civil penalty or other loss or injunctive or declaratory relief the outcome of any allegation lawsuit claim or legal proceeding is inherently uncertain and could result in significant cost damage to our brand or reputation and diversion of management attention from our business company specific financial factor customer adoption of new software based technology may require higher quality service from and meeting these demand could create supply chain issue and could increase capital cost the communication industry ha experienced rapid change in the past several year an increasing number of our customer are using mobile device their primary mean of viewing video in addition business and government body are broadly shifting to wireless based service for home and infrastructure to improve service to their respective customer and constituency we have spent and continue to spend significant capital to shift our wired network to software based technology to manage this demand and are expanding wireless technology to address these consumer demand we are entering into significant number of software licensing agreement and working with software developer to provide network function in lieu of installing switch or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid development in wireless demand while software based functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switch the rapid pace of development mean that we may increasingly need to rely on single source and software solution that have not previously been deployed in production environment should this software not function intended or our license agreement provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claim we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technology at much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected inc dollar in million except per share amountswe depend on various supplier to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating result we depend on supplier to provide directly or through other supplier with item such network equipment customer premise equipment and wireless related equipment such mobile hotspot handset wirelessly enabled computer wireless data card and other connected device for our customer these supplier could fail to provide equipment on timely or cost effective basis or fail to meet our performance expectation for number of reason including difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology inflationary pressure inability to secure component part general business disruption natural disaster safety issue economic and political instability including the outbreak of war and other hostility and public health emergency such the covid pandemic these factor have caused and may cause delay in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key component and shipment of product to the extent that we or our supplier are impacted in certain limited circumstance supplier have been unable to supply product in timely fashion affecting our ability to provide product and service precisely and when requested by our customer it is possible that in some circumstance we could be forced to switch to different key supplier or be unable to meet customer demand for certain product or service because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the product of one or more key supplier with product from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our cost decrease our operating efficiency and have negative effect on our operating result increasing cost to provide service and failure to renew agreement on favorable term or at all could adversely affect operating margin our operating cost including customer acquisition and retention cost could continue to put pressure on margin and customer retention level number of our competitor offering comparable legacy service that rely on alternative technology and business model are typically subject to le regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower cost these competitor generally can focus on discrete customer segment since they do not have regulatory obligation to provide universal service also these competitor have cost advantage compared to due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lower cost network with nonunionized workforce lower employee benefit and fewer retiree we are transitioning service from our old copper based network and seeking regulatory approval where needed at both the state and federal level if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our network transition or obtain approval with onerous condition we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantage we may not realize or sustain the expected benefit from our business transformation initiative and these effort could have materially adverse effect on our business operation financial condition result of operation and competitive position we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiative including the warnermedia discovery transaction which are designed to reduce cost streamline and modernize distribution and customer service remove redundancy and simplify and improve process and support function our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience we intend for these efficiency to enable increased investment in our strategic area of focus which consist of improving broadband connectivity for example fiber and we also expect these initiative to drive efficiency and improved margin if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiative or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goal and achieve anticipated benefit improvement may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operation and competitive position could be adversely affected unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation result could require to pay significant amount or lead to onerous operating procedure we are subject to number of lawsuit both in the united state and in foreign country including at any particular time claim relating to antitrust patent infringement wage and hour personal injury customer privacy violation regulatory proceeding breach of contract and selling and collection practice we also spend substantial resource complying with various government standard which may entail related investigation and litigation in the wireless area we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effect on customer or employee who use such technology including for example wireless device we may incur significant expense defending such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amount or otherwise change our operation in way that could materially adversely affect our operation or financial result cyberattacks impacting our network or system may have material adverse affect on our operation cyberattacks including through the use of malware computer virus distributed denial of service attack ransomware attack credential harvesting social engineering and other mean for obtaining unauthorized access to or disrupting the operation of our network and system and those of our supplier vendor and other service provider could have material adverse effect on our operation cyberattacks can cause equipment or network failure loss of

significant expense potential investigation and legal liability loss of inc dollar in million except per share amountscurrent or future customer and reputational damage our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software it evolves to handle growing demand for video transmission cyberattacks against company including the company and it supplier and vendor have occurred and will continue to occur and have increased in frequency scope and potential harm in recent year the development and maintenance of system to prevent such attack is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating while to date we have not been subject to cyberattacks that individually or in the aggregate have been material to our operation or financial condition the preventive action we take to reduce the risk associated with cyberattacks may be insufficient to repel or mitigate the effect of major cyberattack in the future natural disaster extreme weather condition or terrorist or other hostile act could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruption to our operation our business operation could be subject to interruption by equipment failure power outage terrorist or other hostile act and natural disaster such flooding hurricane and forest fire whether caused by discrete severe weather event and or precipitated by long term climate change such event could cause significant damage to the infrastructure upon which our business operation rely resulting in degradation or disruption of service to our customer well significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation our system redundancy and other measure we take to protect our infrastructure and operation from the impact of such event may be ineffective or inadequate to sustain our operation through all such event any of these occurrence could result in lost revenue from business interruption damage to our reputation and reduced profit increase in our debt level to fund spectrum purchase or other strategic decision could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rate and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trend we have incurred debt to fund significant acquisition well spectrum purchase needed to compete in our industry while we believe such decision were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunity and respond to industry development we did experience credit rating downgrade from historical level bank and potential purchaser of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decision and similar action we may take in the future well expected trend in the industry will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand higher rate of interest impose restrictive covenant or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing additionally our capital allocation plan is focused on among other thing managing our debt level going forward any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of fund liquidity competitive position and access to capital market our business may be impacted by change in tax law and

interpretation of the law are issued or applied in many case the application of existing newly enacted or amended tax law such the tax cut and job act of and the inflation reduction act of may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretation especially when evaluated against ever changing product and service provided by our global telecommunication and technology business in addition tax legislation ha been introduced or is being considered in various jurisdiction that could significantly impact our tax rate tax liability and carrying value of deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability any of these change could materially impact our financial performance and our tax provision net income and cash flow we are also subject to ongoing examination by taxing authority in various jurisdiction although we regularly ass the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of provision for tax there can be no assurance to the outcome of these examination in the event that we have not accurately or fully described disclosed or determined calculated or remitted amount that were due to taxing authority or if the ultimate determination of our tax owed is for an amount in excess of amount previously accrued we could be subject to additional tax penalty and interest which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating result if the distribution of warnermedia together with certain related transaction were to fail to qualify for non recognition treatment for federal income tax purpose under audit then we could be subject to significant tax liability in connection with the warnermedia discovery transaction at received favorable private letter ruling from the irs nonetheless the irs or another applicable tax authority could determine on audit that the distribution by of warnermedia to our stockholder and certain related transaction should be treated taxable transaction if it determines that any of the fact representation or undertaking made in connection with the request for the ruling were incorrect or are violated we may be entitled to indemnification from warner bros discovery warner bros in the case of certain breach of representation or undertaking by warner bros under the tax matter agreement related to the warnermedia discovery transaction however we could potentially be

operation overviewoperating revenue decreased in and the decline reflects the july separation of the video business other business divestiture that were not included in discontinued operation and lower business wireline revenue driven by lower demand for legacy service and product simplification partially offsetting decline were higher mobility service and equipment revenue and to lesser extent gain in broadband service in our communication segment and growth in mexico wireless operation the decline reflects the separation of the video business and the october sale of wireless and wireline operation in puerto rico and the virgin island also contributing to revenue decline wa lower business wireline revenue due in part to higher demand for pandemic related connectivity in the prior year partially offsetting decline were higher mobility equipment and service revenue and gain in broadband service and growth in mexico wireless operation including favorable foreign exchange impact operation and support expense decreased in and the decline reflects the separation of video and lower personnel cost associated with ongoing transformation initiative partially offset by higher bad debt expense the elimination of connect america fund phase ii caf ii government credit and increased wholesale network access charge wireless equipment cost were up slightly with higher sale volume and the sale of higher priced smartphones largely offset by lower shutdown cost in in the first quarter of we updated the expected economic life of customer relationship which extended the amortization period of deferred acquisition and fulfillment cost and reduced expense approximately with recorded to mobility to business wireline and to consumer wireline the decline reflects our business divestiture lower bad debt expense and lower personnel cost associated with our transformation initiative decline were mostly offset by increased domestic wireless equipment expense from

all telecommunication market to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burden that harm consumer welfare nonetheless over the ensuing two decade the federal communication commission fcc and some state regulatory commission have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirement that were imposed decade ago on our traditional wireline subsidiary when they operated legal monopoly more recently the fcc ha pursued more deregulatory agenda eliminating variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulation and streamlining it process in number of area we continue to support regulatory and legislative measure and effort at both the state and federal level to reduce inappropriate regulatory burden that inhibit our ability to compete effectively and offer needed service to our customer including initiative to transition service from traditional network to all ip based network at the same time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulation are not further extended to broadband or wireless service which are subject to vigorous competition internet the fcc currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband service information service subject to light touch

operation in reliance on that order at bid total of and wa awarded band license including mhz available for deployment in december with the remainder available for deployment no later than december in late the federal aviation administration faa questioned whether the band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplane which operate on spectrum band over mhz away from the spectrum at launched in and mhz away from spectrum at plan to launch in in response to allow the faa more time to evaluate at and verizon delayed their planned december band launch by six week and voluntarily committed to series of temporary precautionary measure in addition to deferring turning on limited number of tower around certain airport these measure have been subsequently modified from time to time we continue to work with the faa to reduce the temporary measure with band deployment aircraft equipment is upgraded in recent year the fcc took several action to make spectrum available for

nationwide at cost of inc dollar in million except per share amountsaccounting policy and standard critical accounting policy and estimate because of the size of the financial statement line item they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management some of our accounting policy and estimate have more significant impact on our consolidated financial statement than others pension and postretirement benefit our actuarial estimate of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted average assumption are discussed in note our assumed weighted average discount rate for both pension and postretirement benefit of at december reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow for the obligation these bond had an average rating of at least or aa by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization denominated in dollar and generally not callable convertible or index linked for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december we increased our pension discount rate by resulting in decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of and increased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of our expected long term rate of return wa on pension plan asset and on postretirement plan asset for we have increased our expected return on plan asset to on pension plan asset and on postretirement plan asset for reflecting higher long term capital market expectation for equity and higher yield for bond our expected return on plan asset is calculated using the actual fair value of plan asset if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that decrease in the expected long term rate of return would cause combined pension and postretirement cost to increase which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual return in the current year upon remeasurement of our retiree benefit plan we recognize gain and loss on pension and postretirement plan asset and obligation immediately in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income these gain and loss are generally measured annually of december and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumption the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future year see note for additional discussion regarding our assumption depreciation our depreciation of asset including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiary and estimate of useful life is described in note and if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that one year increase in the useful life of our plant in service would have resulted in decrease of approximately in our depreciation expense and that one year decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately in our depreciation expense see note and for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property plant and equipment including our finance lease right of use asset asset valuation and impairmentsgoodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are not amortized but tested at least annually on october for impairment for impairment testing we estimate fair value using model that predominantly rely on the expected cash flow to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life input underlying the expected cash flow include but are not limited to subscriber count revenue per user capital investment and acquisition cost per subscriber and ongoing operating cost we based our assumption on combination of our historical result trend business plan and marketplace participant data annual goodwill testinggoodwill is tested on reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to it book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured we estimate fair value using an income approach also known discounted cash flow model and market multiple approach the income approach utilizes our future cash flow projection with perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital the market multiple approach us the multiple of publicly traded company whose service are comparable to those offered by the reporting unit of october the calculated fair value

compare the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset to it book value when the asset book value exceeds undiscounted future cash flow an impairment is recorded to reduce the

these risk along with other business risk impact our cost of capital it is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital cost control financial risk and maintain financial flexibility over the long term in managing market risk we employ derivative according to documented policy and procedure including interest rate swap interest rate lock foreign currency exchange contract and combined interest rate foreign currency contract cross currency swap we do not use derivative for trading or speculative purpose we do not foresee significant change in the strategy we use to manage market risk in the near future one of the most significant assumption used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligation is the assumed weighted average discount rate which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow for the obligation in recent year the discount rate have been increasingly volatile and on average have been lower than in historical period lower discount rate used to measure our pension and postretirement plan result in higher obligation future increase in these rate could result in lower obligation improved funded status and actuarial gain interest rate riskthe majority of our financial instrument are medium and long term fixed rate note and debenture change in interest rate can lead to significant fluctuation in the fair value of these instrument the principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate and fair value of our liability that are exposed to interest rate risk are described in note and in managing interest expense we control our mix of fixed and floating rate debt through term loan floating rate note and interest rate swap we have established interest rate risk limit that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivity in our debt and interest rate derivative portfolio most of our foreign denominated long term debt ha been swapped from fixed rate or floating rate foreign currency to fixed rate dollar at issuance through cross currency swap removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payment likewise periodically we enter into interest rate lock to partially hedge the risk of increase in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed rate debt we expect gain or loss in our cross currency swap and interest rate lock to offset the loss and gain in the financial instrument they hedge we had no interest rate swap and no interest rate lock at december foreign exchange riskwe principally use foreign exchange contract to hedge cost and debt denominated in foreign currency we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliate and equity investment in foreign company through cross currency swap most of our foreign denominated debt ha been swapped from fixed rate or floating rate foreign currency to fixed rate dollar at issuance removing interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payment we expect gain or loss in our cross currency swap to offset the gain and loss in the financial instrument they hedge we had cross currency swap with notional value of and fair value of outstanding at december for the purpose of assessing specific risk we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of our financial instrument and result of operation we had foreign exchange forward contract with notional value of and fair value of outstanding at

in an unfunded benefit obligation of million additionally at december the company postretirement benefit obligation wa million and exceeded the fair value of postretirement plan asset of million resulting in an unfunded benefit obligation of million explained in note to the consolidated financial statement the company update the assumption used to measure the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligation including discount rate at december or upon remeasurement event the company determines the discount rate used to measure the obligation based on the development of yield curve using high quality corporate bond selected to yield cash flow that correspond to the expected timing and amount of the expected future benefit payment inc auditing the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligation wa complex due to the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumption made by management primarily the discount rate used in the company measurement process the discount rate ha significant effect on the measurement of the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligation and auditing the discount rate wa complex because it required an evaluation of the credit quality of the corporate bond used to develop the discount rate and the correlation of those bond cash inflow to the timing and amount of future expected benefit payment we

for example we evaluated the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rate applied in measuring the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit obligation part of this assessment we considered the credit quality of the corporate bond that comprised the yield curve and compared the timing and amount of cash flow at maturity with the expected amount and duration of the related

methodology such the discounted cash flow and market multiple approach assumption used in these valuation model are forward looking and change in these assumption can have material effect on the determination of fair value how we addressed thematter in our auditwe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain control over the company impairment evaluation process our procedure included testing control over management review of the valuation model and it determination of the significant assumption described above our audit procedure to test management impairment evaluation included among others assessing the valuation methodology and significant assumption discussed above and the underlying data used to develop such

failure or inability of our customer to make required payment deemed collectible from the customer when the service wa provided or product wa delivered when determining the allowance for trade receivables and loan we consider the probability of recoverability of account receivable based on past experience taking into account current collection trend and general economic factor including bankruptcy rate we also consider future economic trend to estimate expected credit loss over the lifetime of the asset credit risk are assessed based on historical write offs net of recovery well an

accordingly when portion of their depreciable property plant and equipment is retired in the ordinary course of business the gross book value is reclassified to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of these asset property plant and equipment is reviewed for recoverability whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of long lived asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset see note the liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if reasonable estimate of fair value can be made in period subsequent to initial measurement we recognize period to period change in the liability resulting from the

significant to the fair value measurement our valuation technique maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input the valuation methodology described above may produce

crediting rate would increase the pension benefit obligation by we recognize gain and loss on pension and postretirement plan asset and obligation immediately in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income these gain and loss are generally measured annually of december and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumption the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future year discount rate our assumed weighted average discount rate for both pension and postretirement benefit of at december reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow these bond had an average rating of at least or aa by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization denominated in dollar and generally not callable convertible or index linked for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december we increased our pension discount rate by resulting in decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of and increased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of for the year ended december we increased our pension discount rate by resulting in decrease in our pension plan benefit inc dollar in million except per share amountsobligation of and increased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of we utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit under this approach we apply discounting using individual spot rate from yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date these spot rate align to each of the projected benefit obligation and service cost cash flow the service cost component relates to the active participant in the plan so the relevant cash flow on which to apply the yield curve are considerably longer in duration on average than the total projected benefit obligation cash flow which also include benefit payment to retiree interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate by the corresponding discounted projected benefit obligation cash flow the full yield curve approach reduces any actuarial gain and loss based upon interest rate expectation built in gain in interest cost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario or gain and loss merely resulting from the timing and magnitude of cash outflow associated with our benefit obligation neither the annual measurement of our total benefit obligation nor annual net benefit cost is affected by the full yield curve approach expected long term rate of return in our expected long term rate of return is on pension plan asset and on postretirement plan asset an increase of for pension plan asset and for postretirement plan asset this update to our asset return assumption wa due to economic forecast and change in the asset mix our long term rate of return reflect the average rate of earnings expected on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the projected benefit obligation in setting the
