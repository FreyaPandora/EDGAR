of contentsa change in linde plc tax residency could have negative effect on linde plc future profitability and may trigger tax on dividend or exit charge linde plc intends to continue to manage it affair that it is centrally managed and controlled in and effectively managed from the united kingdom and therefore ha it tax residency in the united kingdom however can not assure that linde plc is or will continue to be resident only in the united kingdom for tax purpose under current irish legislation an irish incorporated company will be considered irish tax resident except it is tax resident in territory with which ireland ha double tax treaty under the term of the double tax treaty under current legislation company that is centrally managed and controlled in the united kingdom is regarded resident in the united kingdom for taxation purpose unless it is treated resident in another jurisdiction pursuant to any appropriate double tax treaty with the united kingdom other jurisdiction may also seek to assert taxing jurisdiction over linde plc for example company is subject to german taxation on it worldwide income if it ha either it registered seat or place of effective management and control in germany this is question of fact and need to be determined on an overall assessment of the actual circumstance where company is treated tax resident under the domestic law of the united kingdom and ireland article of the double tax convention between ireland and the united kingdom the residence tie breaker currently provides that the company shall be treated resident only in one of those two jurisdiction if it place of effective management is situated there similar situation would exist if linde plc wa treated tax resident under the domestic law of both the united kingdom and germany or of ireland and germany the organisation for economic co operation and development ha proposed number of measure relating to the tax treatment of multinationals of which are to be implemented by amending double tax treaty through multilateral instrument mli the mli ha been signed by number of country including germany ireland and the united kingdom the mli allows signatory to opt into or out of certain change the effect for given double tax convention depends on the option chosen by the two contracting state ireland and the united kingdom have indicated they intend to change the residence tie breaker so that it will depend on ruling by the competent authority that is the tax authority of the two contracting state instead of an objective application of the place of effective management test accordingly if ireland and the united kingdom maintain their position and enough country ratify the mli the residence tie breaker would be amended to depend on determination by irish revenue commissioner and hm revenue and custom it is not certain this will take place factor will be taken into account in making the determination but linde plc doe not expect such determination to alter it tax residency it is possible that in the future whether result of change in law including the entry into force of the mli or change to the intention of germany ireland or the united kingdom in relation to the mli or the practice of any relevant tax authority or result of any change in the conduct of linde plc affair linde plc could become or be regarded having become resident in jurisdiction other than the united kingdom if linde plc cease to be resident in the united kingdom and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to exit charge and could become liable for additional tax charge in the other jurisdiction including by way of example dividend withholding tax or corporate income tax charge if linde plc were to be treated resident in than one jurisdiction it could be subject to multiple taxation if for example linde plc were considered to be tax resident of ireland linde plc could become liable for irish corporation tax and any dividend paid by it could be subject to irish dividend withholding tax if linde plc were to be treated tax resident in germany it would become liable for german corporate income tax on it worldwide income and trade tax on it income allocable to it german business and dividend paid by linde plc to it shareholder could be subject to german dividend withholding tax and such tax may not be fully creditable or refundable under double tax convention or the domestic rule of shareholder the relevant criterion for linde plc treatment foreign corporation for federal tax purpose may not be met or the irs may not agree with the conclusion that linde plc should be treated such although linde plc is incorporated in ireland the internal revenue service the irs may assert that linde plc should be treated corporation and therefore tax resident for federal income tax purpose pursuant to section of the internal revenue code of amended the code further change to section of the code or the treasury regulation promulgated thereunder or interpretation thereof could affect linde plc status foreign corporation for federal income tax purpose corporation is generally considered domestic corporation or tax resident if it is organized in the united state and corporation is generally considered foreign corporation or non tax resident if it is not domestic corporation because linde plc is an entity incorporated in ireland it would generally be classified foreign corporation or non tax resident under these rule however code section provides an of contentsexception under which foreign incorporated entity may in certain circumstance be treated domestic corporation for federal income tax purpose unless linde plc ha satisfied the substantial business activity exception defined in section and described in more detail below the substantial business activity exception linde plc would be treated domestic corporation tax resident for federal income tax purpose under code section if the percentage by vote or value of linde plc share considered to be held by former holder of praxair share after the merger by reason of holding praxair share for purpose of code section the section percentage is or more if expected the third country rule applies under the third country rule if there is an acquisition of domestic company by foreign acquiring company in which the section percentage is at least reduced from the general threshold otherwise applicable under section of the code and the treasury regulation promulgated thereunder and ii in related acquisition such foreign acquiring company acquires another foreign corporation and the foreign acquiring company is not subject to tax resident in the foreign country in which the acquired foreign corporation wa subject to tax resident prior to the merger the foreign acquiring company will be treated domestic corporation for federal income tax purpose in order for linde plc to satisfy the substantial business activity exception at least of the employee by headcount and compensation real and tangible asset and gross income of the linde plc expanded affiliated group must be based located and derived respectively in the country in which linde plc is tax resident after the merger the substantial business activity exception is not expected to be satisfied the section percentage is currently expected to be le than however the calculation of the section percentage is complex is calculated based on the fact of the effective time of the merger is subject to detailed regulation the application of which is uncertain in various respect and would be impacted by change in such regulation and is subject to factual uncertainty including fluctuation in the value of praxair share and therefore in the value of linde plc share of the effective time of the merger result the irs could assert that the section percentage is greater than or equal to and that linde plc therefore is treated for federal income tax purpose domestic corporation tax resident if the irs successfully challenge linde plc status foreign corporation significant adverse tax consequence would result for linde plc the combined group and for certain of linde plc stockholder linde plc is not currently expected to be treated domestic corporation but it is possible that change in federal income tax law could alter that result transfer of linde plc ordinary share may be subject to irish stamp duty for the majority of transfer of linde plc share there will not be any irish stamp duty however irish stamp duty will become payable in respect of certain share transfer occurring after completion of the business combination transfer of linde plc share from seller who hold share beneficially through dtc or clearstream to buyer who hold the acquired share beneficially will not be subject to irish stamp duty unless the transfer involves change in the nominee that is the record holder of the transferred share transfer of linde plc share by seller who hold share directly not through dtc or clearstream to any buyer or by seller who hold the share beneficially to buyer who hold the acquired share directly may be subject to irish stamp duty currently at the rate of of the price paid or the market value of the share acquired if higher payable by the buyer shareholder who directly hold share may transfer those share into or broker account to be held through dtc clearstream or vice versa without giving rise to irish stamp duty provided that the shareholder ha confirmed to linde plc transfer agent that there is no change in the ultimate beneficial ownership of the share result of the transfer and the transfer is not in contemplation of sale of the share because of the potential irish stamp duty on transfer of linde plc share directly registered praxair shareholder may face disadvantage if they not open broker account and do not transfer their share into such account soon possible and in any event prior to completion of the business combination any person who wish to acquire linde plc share after completion of the business combination may face disadvantage if they do not acquire such share through dtc or clearstream change in tax law and policy could adversely impact linde plc financial position or result of operation linde plc praxair and linde are subject to the tax rule and regulation in the germany ireland the and other country in which linde plc praxair and linde and their affiliate operate such tax rule and regulation are subject to change on prospective or retroactive basis under current economic and political condition including the referendum in june in the in which voter approved an exit from the eu and the ongoing exit process tax rate and policy in any jurisdiction including the the and eu are subject to significant change in particular since linde plc is expected to be treated tax resident any potential change in the tax rule applying to tax resident company would directly of contentsaffect linde plc when tax rule change this may result in higher tax expense and the need to make higher tax payment in addition change in tax legislation may have significant impact on linde plc praxair and linde tax receivables and tax liability well on their deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability moreover uncertainty about the tax environment in some region may restrict linde plc praxair or linde opportunity to enforce their respective right under the law company in the combined group will also operate in country with complex tax regulation which could be interpreted in different way interpretation of these regulation or change in the tax system might have an adverse impact on the tax liability profitability and business operation of praxair linde or the combined group linde plc praxair inc and linde ag and their respective subsidiary are subject to periodic audit by the tax authority in various jurisdiction or other review action by the relevant financial or tax authority the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amount recorded in linde plc praxair and linde financial statement and may materially affect their respective financial result for the period when such determination is made in the current environment the congress the european union the organisation for economic co operation and development and other government agency in jurisdiction where linde plc and it affiliate do business have had an extended focus on issue related to the taxation of multinational corporation one area of focus ha been base erosion and profit shifting including situation where payment are made between affiliate from jurisdiction with high tax rate to jurisdiction with lower tax rate however the prospect of any reform with respect to these issue remains highly uncertain any such change among other possible change in applicable tax rule and regulation could affect the treatment of linde plc praxair linde or their respective affiliate or shareholder significantly additionally on december tax reform legislation wa enacted in the united state this legislation made significant change to the internal revenue code that are are highly complex and unclear and there is limited guidance regarding their application the overall impact of this legislation also depends on the future interpretation and regulation that may be issued by tax authority there ha been no prior public market for linde plc share and the market price of linde plc share may be volatile linde plc will list the linde plc share on the nyse and the frankfurt stock exchange it is not expected but can not be entirely excluded that an active public market for linde plc share may not develop or be sustained after the completion of the business combination linde plc can not predict the extent to which trading market will develop or liquid that market might become the market price of linde plc share may be volatile broad general economic political market and

sufficient distributable reserve in the audited statutory financial statement of linde plc result of it business activity the right of the shareholder of linde plc and the responsibility of member of linde plc board of director will be governed by irish law and the linde plc constitution which will differ in some respect from the right and responsibility of shareholder under delaware or german law and the current organizational document of praxair inc and linde ag following the completion of the business combination linde plc corporate affair will be governed by the linde plc constitution and the law governing company incorporated in ireland the right of linde plc shareholder and the responsibility of member of the linde plc board of director under the law of ireland will differ from the

management of the combined group after the completion of the business combination praxair shareholder and linde ag shareholder will own smaller percentage of linde plc than they currently own of praxair inc and linde ag respectively because ownership in linde plc share will be allocated between praxair and linde ag shareholder in accordance with the exchange ratio set forth in the business combination agreement consequently praxair shareholder group will have reduced ownership and voting power in the combined group compared to their current ownership and voting power in praxair inc and linde ag shareholder group will have reduced ownership and voting power in the combined group compared to their current ownership and voting power in linde ag and each group could exercise le influence over the management and policy of the combined group than they currently have over the management and policy of praxair and linde respectively of contentslinde plc shareholder could be diluted in the future if linde plc increase it issued share capital because of the dis application of statutory preemption right in addition shareholder in certain jurisdiction including the united state may not be able to exercise their pre emption right even if those right have not been dis applied matter of irish law holder of linde plc share will have pre emption right with respect to any issuance of linde plc share for cash consideration or the granting of right to subscribe for linde plc share for cash consideration unless such pre emption right is dis applied in whole or in part either in the linde plc constitution or by resolution of the shareholder of linde plc at general meeting of shareholder or otherwise it is intended that the linde plc constitution that will be in

issue up to all of linde plc authorized but unissued share capital on non pre emptive basis for cash consideration at any stage during the period of five year after the date of completion of the business combination accordingly the board of director will have discretion to issue up to all of linde plc authorized but unissued share capital for cash consideration without regard to pre emption right for period of five year from the date of completion of the business combination in addition even if the dis application of pre emption right contained in the linde plc constitution expires and is not renewed by shareholder at general meeting or is terminated by the shareholder of linde plc in general meeting due to law and regulation in certain jurisdiction outside ireland shareholder in such jurisdiction may not be able to exercise their pre emption right unless linde plc take action to register or otherwise qualify the right offering under the law of that jurisdiction for example in the united state holder of linde plc share may not be able to exercise pre emption right unless registration statement under the security act is declared effective with respect to the linde plc share issuable upon exercise of such right or an exemption from the registration requirement is available if shareholder in such jurisdiction are unable to exercise their pre emption right their ownership interest in linde plc would be diluted any future issuance of linde plc share or debt instrument convertible into linde plc share where pre emption right of linde plc shareholder are not available or are excluded would result in the dilution of existing linde plc shareholder and reduce the earnings per linde plc share which could have material adverse effect on the price of linde plc share civil liability may not be enforceable against linde plc linde plc is organized under the law of ireland and substantial portion of it asset will be located outside of the united state in addition certain member of the board of director of linde plc the linde plc board of director reside outside the united state result it may be difficult for investor to effect service of process within the united state upon linde plc or such other person or to enforce outside the united state judgment obtained against such person in court in any action including action predicated upon the civil liability provision of the federal security law in addition it may be difficult for investor to enforce in original action brought in court in jurisdiction located outside the united state right predicated upon the federal security law judgment for the payment of money rendered by court in the united state would not be automatically enforceable in ireland there is no treaty between ireland and the united state providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgment the following requirement must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland the judgment must be for definite sum ii the judgment must be final and conclusive and iii the judgment must be provided by court of competent jurisdiction an irish court will also exercise it right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment wa obtained by fraud violated irish public policy is in breach of natural justice or if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment based on the foregoing

director or any officer of such company or any expert named herein who is resident of country other than the united state any judgment obtained in court in civil and commercial matter including
