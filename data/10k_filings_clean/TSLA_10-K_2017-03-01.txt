and owner manual requirement the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturer of motor vehicle to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy rating determined by epa well crash test rating determined by nhtsa if such test are conducted our vehicle sold in outside of the are subject to foreign safety testing regulation many of those regulation are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standard applicable in the united state and may require redesign and or retesting regulation battery safety and testing our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulation that govern transport of dangerous good defined to include lithium ion battery which may present risk in transportation the regulation vary by mode of shipping transportation such by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation test for our battery pack demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulation we use lithium metal oxide cell in our high voltage battery pack the cell do not contain any lead mercury cadmium other hazardous material heavy metal or toxic material our battery pack include certain packaging material that contain trace amount of hazardous chemical whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery pack automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation state law regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobile and generally require motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer to be licensed in order to sell vehicle directly to consumer in the state we open additional tesla store and service center we secure dealer license or their equivalent and engage in sale activity to sell our vehicle directly to consumer few state such michigan and connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturer to be licensed dealer or to act in the capacity of dealer or otherwise restrict manufacturer ability to deliver or service vehicle to sell vehicle to resident of state where we are not licensed dealer we generally conduct the sale of the state via the internet phone or mail in such state we have opened gallery that serve an educational purpose and are not retail location we expand our retail footprint in the united state some automobile dealer trade association have both challenged the legality of our operation in court and used administrative and legislative process to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing store or expand to new location we expect that the dealer association will continue to mount challenge to our business model in addition we expect the dealer association to actively lobby state licensing agency and legislator to interpret existing law or enact new law in way not favorable to tesla ownership and operation of it own retail and service location and we intend to actively fight any such effort to limit our ability to sell our own vehicle while we have analyzed the principal law in the eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such law we have not performed complete analysis of all jurisdiction in which we may sell vehicle accordingly there may be law in certain jurisdiction that may restrict our sale and service operation energy storage the regulatory regime for energy storage project is still under development nevertheless there are various policy incentive and financial mechanism at the federal state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage system that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the tax credit under section of the internal revenue code or the irc described below in addition california and number of other state have adopted procurement target for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage system qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ha also taken step to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy market in and ferc removed many barrier for system like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these system can obtain in wholesale energy market more recently in late ferc released notice of proposed rulemaking that if it becomes final rule would further break barrier preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy market finally in january ferc issued statement supporting the use of energy storage both electric transmission and electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage system to provide greater value to the electric grid solar energy system government and utility program and incentive federal state and local government have established various policy incentive and financial mechanism to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentive include tax credit cash grant tax abatement and rebate the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit or federal itc under two section of the irc section and section section of the irc allows taxpayer to claim credit of of qualified expenditure for commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december the credit then decline to in in and permanent thereafter we claim the section commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial project based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy system section of the irc allows homeowner taxpayer to claim credit of of qualified expenditure for residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december the credit then decline to in and in and is scheduled to expire thereafter customer who purchase their solar energy system for cash or through our solar loan are eligible to claim the section investment tax credit in addition to the federal itc many state offer personal and corporate tax credit and incentive available for solar energy system regulation general we are not regulated utility in the to operate our system we obtain interconnection agreement from the utility in almost all case interconnection agreement are standard form agreement that have been pre approved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body sale of electricity and non sale equipment lease by third party such our solarleases and solarppas face regulatory challenge in some state and jurisdiction regulation net metering forty one state washington and puerto rico have regulatory policy known net energy metering or net metering available to new solar customer net metering typically allows solar customer to interconnect their on site solar energy system to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchase by receiving bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid each of the state where we currently serve customer ha adopted net metering policy except for texas where certain individual utility have adopted net metering or policy similar to net metering in certain jurisdiction regulator or utility have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so regulation mandated renewable capacity many state also have adopted procurement requirement for renewable energy production such an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policy that require covered entity to procure specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customer in the state from eligible renewable energy source such solar energy system to prove compliance with such mandate utility typically must surrender renewable energy certificate solar renewable energy certificate or srec is tradable credit that represents all of the clean energy benefit of electricity generated from solar energy system every time solar energy system generates kwh of electricity one srec is issued or minted by government agency the srec can then be sold or traded separately from the energy produced generally through broker and dealer facilitating individually negotiated bilateral arrangement competition vehicle the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future we introduce additional lower priced vehicle such our model and we introduce other type of vehicle we believe the primary competitive factor in our market include but are not limited to technological innovation product quality and safety service option product performance design and styling brand perception product price and manufacturing efficiency we believe that our vehicle compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification well based on their propulsion technology for example model and model compete primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan and premium suv market with internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer including audi bmw lexus and mercedes and model will compete with small to medium sized sedan from manufacturer including audi bmw lexus mercedes honda and toyota our vehicle also compete with vehicle propelled by alternative fuel principally electricity many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcement and vehicle introduction promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicle particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle bmw daimler nissan fiat ford general motor and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicle available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturer are also developing electric vehicle electric vehicle have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign country and we expect number of those manufacturer to enter the united state market well in addition several manufacturer including general motor toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicle including plug in version of their hybrid vehicle energy storage the market for energy storage product is also highly competitive established company such aes energy storage lg chem and samsung well various emerging company have introduced product that are similar to our product portfolio there are several company providing individual component of energy storage system such cell battery module and power electronics well others providing integrated system we compete with these company on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the superior specification of our product our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack product give competitive advantage when marketing our product solar energy system the primary competitor to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility company that supply energy to our potential customer we compete with these traditional utility company primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customer can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy system rather than fossil fuel based alternative we also compete with solar energy company that provide product and service in distinct segment of solar energy and energy related product many solar energy company only install solar energy system while others only provide financing for these installation in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitor include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sungevity inc and many smaller local solar company intellectual property part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property right such with respect to patent trademark copyright trade secret including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreement and other contractual arrangement additionally we previously announced patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit against any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting other company making electric vehicle and the world segment information we operate two reportable segment automotive and energy generation and storage the automotive segment includes the design development manufacturing and sale of electric vehicle the energy generation and storage segment includes the design manufacture installation and sale or lease of stationary energy storage product and solar energy system to residential and commercial customer or sale of electricity generated by our solar energy system to customer employee of december tesla inc had full time employee and solarcity corporation had full time employee

described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our business and industry we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future significant delay or other complication in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of new vehicle and other product such our energy storage product and the solar roof which could harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we have experienced in the past launch manufacturing and production ramp delay or other complication in connection with new vehicle model such model and model and new vehicle feature such the all wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model and the second version of autopilot hardware for example at time since the launch of model we encountered unanticipated challenge such certain supply chain constraint that forced to decrease the production of these vehicle from our initial expectation if unexpected issue arise or recur with respect to any of our production vehicle we may experience further delay in addition our vehicle model share certain production facility with other model the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other model we may also experience similar delay or other complication in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicle such model and other product such our energy storage product and the solar roof any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of our current product or the development manufacture launch and production ramp of our future product including complication associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain or regulatory approval could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we may experience delay in realizing our projected timeline and cost and volume target for the production launch and ramp of our model vehicle which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plan to develop manufacture market and sell the model vehicle which we intend to offer at lower price point and to produce at significantly higher volume than our present production capability for the model or model vehicle we unveiled prototype of model in march and have announced our goal to achieve volume production and delivery of this vehicle in the second half of we have no experience to date in manufacturing vehicle at the high volume that we anticipate for model and to be successful we will need to implement efficient automated and low cost manufacturing capability process and supply chain necessary to support such volume we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model is in compliance with our quality standard and applicable regulation prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicle moreover our model production plan will also require significant investment of cash and management resource our production plan for model is based on many key assumption including that we will be able to build and equip new dedicated final assembly line for high volume production of model at the tesla factory without exceeding our projected cost and on our projected timeline that we will be able to continue to expand gigafactory in timely manner to produce high volume of quality lithium ion cell and integrate such cell into finished battery pack for model all at cost that allow to sell model at our target gross margin that the equipment and process which we install for model production will be able to accurately manufacture high volume of model vehicle within specified design tolerance and with high quality that we will be able to continue to engage supplier for the necessary component on term and condition that are acceptable to and that we will be able to obtain component on timely basis and in the necessary quantity to support high volume production that we will be able to complete our final tooling production planning and validation for model and the delivery of final component design to our supplier in timely manner and that we will be able to attract recruit hire and train skilled employee including employee on the production line to operate our planned high volume production facility to support model including at the tesla factory and gigafactory if one or more of the foregoing assumption turn out to be incorrect our ability to successfully launch model on time and at volume and price that are profitable well our business prospect operating result and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted we may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production and delivery plan both of which could harm our business and prospect our plan call for significant increase in vehicle production and delivery to high volume in short amount of time our ability to achieve these plan will depend upon number of factor including our ability to add production line and capacity planned while maintaining our desired quality level and optimize design and production change and our supplier ability to support our need in addition we have used and may use in the future number of new manufacturing technology technique and process for our vehicle which we must successfully introduce and scale for high volume production for example we have introduced aluminum spot welding system and high speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle part we have also introduced unique design feature in our vehicle with different manufacturing challenge such inch display screen dual motor drivetrain autopilot hardware and falcon wing door we have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resource among multiple product simultaneously if we are unable to realize our plan our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially damaged concurrent with the significant planned increase in our vehicle production level we will also need to continue to significantly increase delivery of our vehicle we have limited experience in delivering high volume of vehicle and no experience in delivering vehicle at the significantly higher volume we anticipate for model and we may face difficulty meeting our delivery and growth plan into both existing market well new market into which we expand if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goal globally this could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result our current product contain numerous purchased part which we source globally from hundred of direct supplier the majority of are currently single source supplier despite effort to qualify and obtain component from multiple source whenever feasible any significant unanticipated demand would require to procure additional component in short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain supplier because of their failure to provide component that met our quality control standard while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate source of supply for most of our component in relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacement for certain highly customized component of our product moreover we have signed long term agreement with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithium ion cell at gigafactory in nevada and pv cell and panel at gigafactory in buffalo new york if we encounter unexpected difficulty with key supplier such panasonic and if we are unable to fill these need from other supplier we could experience production delay and potential loss of access to important technology and part for producing servicing and supporting our product this limited supply chain expose to multiple potential source of delivery failure or component shortage for the production of our product such those which we experienced in and in connection with our slower than planned model and model ramp furthermore unexpected change in business condition material pricing labor issue war governmental change natural disaster such the march earthquake in japan and other factor beyond our and our supplier control could also affect our supplier ability to deliver component to on timely basis the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of component from these supplier could lead to product design change and delay in product delivery to our customer which could hurt our relationship with our customer and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and material and adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result change in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increase from certain of our supplier in order to meet our quality target and development timeline well due to design change that we made and we may experience similar cost increase in the future certain supplier including for model have sought to renegotiate the term of the supply arrangement additionally we are negotiating with existing supplier for cost reduction seeking new and le expensive supplier for certain part and attempting to redesign certain part to make them le expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our effort to control and reduce supplier cost our operating result will suffer we expect the foregoing discussion to apply generally to model however because we plan to produce model at significantly higher volume than model or model the negative impact of any delay or other constraint with respect to our supplier for model could be substantially greater than any such issue experienced with respect to our product to date some of our supplier for our current production vehicle do not have the resource equipment or capability to provide component for the model in line with our requirement we have engaged significant number of new supplier and such supplier will also have to ramp to achieve our need in short period of time there is no assurance that these supplier will ultimately be able to meet our cost quality and volume need furthermore the scale of our vehicle production increase we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facility component at much higher volume than we have experience with if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantity of component purchase to our actual production plan or capability or successfully implement automation inventory management and other system to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may have to incur unexpected storage transportation and write cost which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result our future growth and success is dependent upon consumer willingness to adopt electric vehicle and specifically our vehicle especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumer of alternative fuel vehicle in general and electric vehicle in particular although we have successfully grown demand for model and model to date and have seen very strong initial demand for model and we believe that we will be able to continue to grow demand separately for each of these vehicle and their variant there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicle will not compete with one another in the market moreover the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model is larger but more competitive than for model and model if the market for electric vehicle in general and tesla vehicle in particular not develop we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicle is relatively new rapidly evolving and could be affected by numerous external factor such perception about electric vehicle feature quality safety performance and cost perception about the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge competition including from other type of alternative fuel vehicle plug in hybrid electric vehicle and high fuel economy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline government regulation and economic incentive and access to charging facility future problem or delay in expanding gigafactory and operating it in line with our expectation could negatively affect the production and profitability of our battery based product such model or our energy storage product to lower the cost of cell production and produce cell in high volume we intend to integrate the production of lithium ion cell and finished battery pack for our vehicle including model and energy storage product at gigafactory while gigafactory began producing lithium ion cell for energy storage product in january we have no other direct experience in the production of lithium ion cell including those intended for use in vehicle although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future event could result in the cost of expanding and operating gigafactory exceeding our current expectation and gigafactory taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate in order to build our model vehicle at our planned volume and target gross margin we must have significant battery cell production from gigafactory if we are unable to expand gigafactory in timely manner and attract hire and retain substantial number of highly skilled personnel to work there in order to produce high volume of quality lithium ion cell at reasonable price our ability to supply battery pack to our vehicle especially model and other battery based product according to our schedule and or at price that allows to sell them at our target gross margin and in the quantity we estimate could be negatively impacted any such future problem or delay with gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result if our vehicle or other product that contain our vehicle powertrains or battery pack fail to perform expected our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicle could be harmed if our vehicle other oems vehicle that contain our powertrains or our energy storage product were to contain defect in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform expected or that require repair our ability to develop market and sell our product could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicle is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and could conceivably contain defect and error issue experienced by customer have included those related to the software for the inch display screen the panoramic roof and the volt battery in the model and the seat and door in the model although we attempt to remedy any issue we observe in our vehicle effectively and rapidly possible such effort may not be timely may hamper production or may not be up to the satisfaction of our customer while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long term quality reliability durability and performance characteristic of our battery pack powertrains vehicle and energy storage product there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in our product prior to their sale to consumer any product defect or any other failure of our product to perform expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delay product recall product liability claim significant warranty and other expense and could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating result and prospect our model vehicle have not yet been evaluated by nhtsa for star rating under the new car assessment program and while based on our internal testing we expect to obtain comparable rating to those achieved by model there is no assurance this will occur if we fail to scale our business operation and otherwise manage future growth effectively we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our product successfully any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition we continue to expand our operation significantly especially internationally including by planned transition to high volume vehicle production and the worldwide sale and servicing of significantly higher number of vehicle than our current vehicle fleet in the coming year with the launch and ramp of model furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in country where we have limited or no previous operating experience in connection with our vehicle business our future operating result depend to large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expense and avoid cost overrun and other unexpected operating cost establish sufficient worldwide sale service and supercharger facility in timely manner adapt our product to meet local requirement implement the required infrastructure system and process and find and hire significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel if we are unable to continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of model and model or control manufacturing cost for model our financial condition and operating result will suffer we have gradually ramped production of model and model manufacturing cost per vehicle have decreased while we expect ongoing cost reduction to be realized by both and our supplier there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost saving to reach our gross margin and profitability goal we incur significant cost related to procuring the material required to manufacture our vehicle assembling vehicle and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial cost or cost overrun in increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facility such for model furthermore if we are unable to achieve production cost target on our model and model vehicle pursuant to our plan we may not be able to meet our gross margin and other financial target furthermore many of the factor that impact our manufacturing cost are beyond our control such potential increase in the cost of our material and component such lithium ion battery cell or aluminum used to produce body panel if we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing cost our operating result business and prospect will be harmed we are significantly dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of limited fleet of electric vehicle which currently includes the model and model and which will also include model in the near term we currently generate significant percentage of our revenue from the sale of two product model and model vehicle model for which we are planning to achieve volume production and delivery in second half of requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction and there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful historically automobile customer have come to expect variety of vehicle offered in manufacturer fleet and new and improved vehicle model to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectation we may in the future be required to introduce on regular basis new vehicle model well enhanced version of existing vehicle model to the extent our product variety and cycle do not meet consumer expectation our future sale may be adversely affected our vehicle and energy storage product make use of lithium ion battery cell which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such event have raised concern and future event may lead to additional concern about the battery used in automotive application the battery pack that we produce make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur which could subject to lawsuit product recall or redesign effort all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perception regarding the suitability of lithium ion cell for automotive application or any future incident involving lithium ion cell such vehicle or other fire even if such incident doe not involve our vehicle could seriously harm our business in addition we store significant number of lithium ion cell at the tesla factory and plan to produce high volume of cell and battery module and pack at gigafactory any mishandling of battery cell may cause disruption to the operation of our facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially safety recall moreover any failure of competitor electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for and our product such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of material in particular for lithium ion cell could harm our business we may experience increase in the cost or sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of material any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we use various material in our business including aluminum steel lithium cobalt nickel and copper well lithium ion cell from supplier the price for these material fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market condition and global demand for these material including result of increased production of electric vehicle and energy storage product by our competitor and could adversely affect our business and operating result for instance we are exposed to multiple risk relating to lithium ion cell these risk include the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturer to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plant to supply the number of lithium ion cell we require disruption in the supply of cell due to quality issue or recall by battery cell manufacturer or any issue that may arise with respect to cell manufactured at our own facility an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of material used in the cell and fluctuation in the value of the japanese yen against the dollar our battery cell purchase for model and model are currently denominated in japanese yen our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cell for the battery pack used in our vehicle and energy storage product while we believe several source of the battery cell are available for such battery pack and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cell manufactured at our own facility we have to date fully qualified only very limited number of supplier for the cell used in such battery pack and have very limited flexibility in changing cell supplier in particular we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cell used in battery pack for our current production vehicle any disruption in the supply of battery cell from such supplier could disrupt production of our vehicle and of the battery pack we produce for other automobile manufacturer such time different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuation or shortage in petroleum and other economic condition may cause to experience significant increase in freight charge and material cost substantial increase in the price for our material or price charged to such those charged by battery cell supplier would increase our operating cost and could reduce our margin if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased vehicle price any attempt to increase vehicle price in response to increased material cost could result in cancellation of vehicle order and reservation and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospect and operating result we may become subject to product liability claim which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claim product liability claim could harm our business prospect operating result and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experience significant product liability claim and we face inherent risk of exposure to claim in the event our vehicle do not perform expected resulting in personal injury or death we also may face similar claim related to any misuse or failure of new technology that we are pioneering including autopilot in our vehicle finally our energy storage product and solar energy system generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property successful product liability claim against could require to pay substantial monetary award our risk in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicle and energy storage product delivered to date and limited field experience of our product moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our product and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand business prospect and operating result in most jurisdiction we generally self insure against the risk of product liability claim meaning that any product liability claim will likely have to be paid from company fund not by insurance the market in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industry we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitor and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from company with new technology the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicle will be successful in the respective market in which they compete many established and new automobile manufacturer such bmw daimler general motor and toyota well other company have entered or are reported to have plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plug in hybrid and fully electric vehicle most of our current and potential competitor have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resource than we do and may be able to devote greater resource to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product virtually all of our competitor have more extensive customer base and broader customer and industry relationship than we do and almost all of these company have longer operating history and greater name recognition than we do increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition upon the launch of our model vehicle we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturer in the extremely competitive entry level premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes the solar and renewable energy industry are highly competitive within their market and also compete with large utility decrease in the retail price of electricity from the utility or other renewable energy source could harm our ability to offer competitive pricing and lead to an increased rate of customer default under our existing contract moreover solar panel price have declined and are continuing to decline we increase our solar panel manufacturing including at gigafactory future price decline may harm our ability to compete and produce solar panel at competitive price if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long term business prospect among consumer analyst and within our industry then our financial condition operating result business prospect and stock price may suffer materially consumer may be le likely to purchase our product now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operation will continue for many year similarly supplier and other third party will be le likely to invest time and resource in developing business relationship with if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst and other party in our liquidity and long term business prospect maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factor such our limited operating history unfamiliarity with our product competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicle or our other product and service and our quarterly production and sale performance compared with market expectation many of these factor are largely outside our control and any negative perception about our long term business prospect even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund if needed our plan to expand our network of tesla store gallery service center and supercharger will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet expectation with respect to additional sale or installation of our product or availability of supercharger our plan to expand our network of tesla store gallery service center and supercharger will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet our expectation with respect to additional sale or installation of our product this ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into market in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing and or servicing our product and which may pose legal regulatory cultural and political challenge that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sale and installation and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore the increasing number of model and model vehicle well the significant increase in our vehicle fleet size that we expect from model will require to continue to increase the number of our supercharger station significantly if we fail to do so our customer could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sale of our vehicle we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirement applicable to the sale installation and service of our product the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy system and operation of supercharger in those jurisdiction which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delay or can not meet customer expectation in expanding our network of tesla store gallery service center and supercharger this could lead to decrease in sale or installation of our product and could negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we face risk associated with our international operation and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor condition and with establishing ourselves in new market all of which could harm our business we currently have international operation and subsidiary in various country and jurisdiction that are subject to legal political and regulatory requirement and social and economic condition that may be very different from those affecting domestically additionally part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sale service and supercharger location internationally international expansion requires to make significant expenditure including the establishment of local operating entity hiring of local employee and establishing facility in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to number of risk associated with international business activity that may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our product and require significant management attention these risk include conforming our product to various international regulatory and safety requirement well charging and other electric infrastructure difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operation challenge in attracting customer foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement our ability to enforce our contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control and preference of foreign nation for domestically manufactured product if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risk related to our vehicle financing program our business may suffer we offer vehicle financing arrangement through our local subsidiary in the united state canada germany and the uk including leasing directly through certain of those subsidiary the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual value secure adequate financing and or business partner to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the need for leasing and other financing option to be significantly higher with the volume we expect for our vehicle in the future especially model for which we also expect higher proportion of uptake for such program than for model or model if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal fund or partner or other external financing source and compelling alternative financing program are not available for our customer we may be unable to grow our sale furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the greater level of residual and credit risk resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state and or local financial regulation and consumer protection law governing lease transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty either of which may harm our business our resale value guarantee and leasing program for our vehicle expose to the risk that the resale value of vehicle returned to are lower than our estimate and may result in lower revenue gross margin profitability and liquidity we have provided resale value guarantee to many of our customer under which such customer may sell their vehicle back to at certain point in time at pre determined resale value customer can lease our vehicle through both leasing partner and from directly through our captive finance company the resale value of any vehicle resold or returned to pursuant to these program may be lower than our estimate which are based on limited secondary market for our vehicle if we incorrectly estimate the residual value of our vehicle or the volume of vehicle returned to is higher than our estimate and or we are not able to resell them timely or at all our profitability and or liquidity could be negatively impacted in case where customer retain their vehicle past the guarantee period our gross margin will be negatively impacted all remaining revenue and cost related to the vehicle will be recognized at no gross profit we apply lease accounting on sale of vehicle with resale value guarantee and on lease made directly by or by our leasing partner under lease accounting we recognize the associated revenue and cost of the vehicle sale over time rather than fully upfront at vehicle delivery result these program generate lower revenue in the period the car is delivered and higher gross margin during the period of the resale value guarantee compared to purchase in which the resale value guarantee doe not apply higher than anticipated prevalence of these program could therefore have an adverse impact on our near term revenue and operating result moreover unlike the sale of vehicle with resale value guarantee or program with leasing partner which do not impact our cash flow and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery under lease held directly by we may receive only very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by stream of payment over the term of the lease to the extent we expand our leasing program without securing external financing or business partner to support such expansion our cash flow and liquidity could also be negatively impacted the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determination with respect to government and economic incentive in the united state and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our product and service we currently benefit from certain government and economic incentive supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle in the united state and abroad such incentive include among other thing tax credit or rebate that encourage the purchase of electric vehicle in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicle is not currently subject to import tax tax on non recurring vehicle fee the value added tax or the purchase tax that apply to the purchase of gas powered vehicle notably the quantum of incentive program promoting electric vehicle is tiny fraction of the amount of incentive that are provided to gas powered vehicle through the oil and gas industry nevertheless even the limited benefit from such program could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example on january previously available incentive in denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicle expired and wa replaced with newly phased in incentive that is le generous than the incentive that it replaced moreover under current regulation federal tax credit available in the united state for the purchase of qualified electric vehicle with at least kwh of battery capacity such our vehicle will begin to phase out with respect to any vehicle delivered in the second calendar quarter following the quarter in which we deliver our qualifying vehicle in the united state in addition california implemented regulation phasing out cash rebate on qualified electric vehicle for high income consumer which became effective in march in certain circumstance there is pressure from the oil and gas lobby or related special interest to bring about such development which could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicle in addition certain governmental rebate tax credit and other financial incentive that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product business allow to lower our installation cost cost of capital and encourage investor to invest in our solar financing fund however these incentive may expire on particular date end when the allocated funding is exhausted or be reduced or terminated solar energy adoption rate increase often without warning for example the federal government currently offer investment tax credit itc for the installation of solar power facility and if installed concurrently for energy storage system which are currently scheduled to decline to and expire altogether for residential system by january likewise in jurisdiction where net energy metering is currently available our customer receive bill credit from utility for energy that their solar energy system generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdiction have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reduction in or termination of governmental incentive could adversely impact our result of operation by increasing our cost of capital making le competitive for potential customer and adversely impact our ability to attract investment partner and to form new financing fund for our solar asset moreover we and our fund investor claim the itc in amount based on the fair market value of our solar energy system although we obtain independent appraisal to support the claimed fair market value the relevant governmental authority have audited such value and in certain case have determined that they should be lower and they may do so in the future such determination may result in adverse tax consequence and or our obligation to make indemnification or other payment or contribute additional asset to our fund or fund investor if we are unable to integrate solarcity successfully into our business we may not realize the anticipated benefit of our acquisition of solarcity we have devoted to date and continue to devote substantial attention and resource to integrating into our company the business and operation of solarcity which we acquired in november our company ha no prior experience integrating business of the size and scale of solarcity if the integration process take longer than expected or is more costly than expected we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefit of the acquisition potential difficulty we may encounter in the integration process include the following the inability to successfully combine our business with that of solarcity in manner that permit the combined company to achieve the synergy we expect from the acquisition which would result in the anticipated benefit of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all complexity associated with managing the combined business integrating personnel from the two company creation of uniform standard control procedure policy and information system and potential unknown liability and unforeseen increased expense delay or regulatory condition associated with the acquisition any failure by to realize the expected benefit of our substantial investment and commitment with respect to the manufacture of pv cell including if we are unable to comply with the term of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory could result in negative consequence for our business part of our acquisition of solarcity we acquired certain pv cell manufacturing and technology asset and build to suit lease arrangement with the research foundation for the state university of new york the foundation this agreement with the foundation provides for the construction of gigafactory in buffalo new york which at full capacity we expect will be capable of producing gigawatt of pv cell including for our solar roof under this agreement we are obligated to among other thing employ specified minimum number of personnel in the state of new york during the year period following the arrival of manufacturing equipment the receipt of certain permit and other specified item at gigafactory and spend or incur approximately billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period following the achievement of full production output at gigafactory if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligation we would be obligated to pay program payment of million to the foundation in such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirement of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amount to the foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory and or the need to secure an alternative supply of pv cell for product such our solar roof moreover if we are unable to utilize the other manufacturing and technology asset that were acquired in the solarcity acquisition in accordance with our expectation we may have to recognize accounting charge pertaining to the write off of such asset any of the foregoing event could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate which could negatively affect our financial result our revenue and cost denominated in foreign currency are not completely matched we have increased model delivery in market outside of the united state we have much higher revenue than cost denominated in other currency such the euro chinese yuan norwegian krone british pound and canadian dollar any strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenue measured in dollar we have historically experienced in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activity intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact result our operating result could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and or retain key employee and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed the loss of the service of any of our key employee could disrupt our operation delay the development and introduction of our vehicle and service and negatively impact our business prospect and operating result in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer and jeffrey straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officer and other key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result key talent may leave tesla due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive experience currently in california there is increasing competition for talented individual with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicle software engineer manufacturing engineer and other skilled employee this competition affect both our ability to retain key employee and hire new one our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employee in timely manner especially to support our expansion plan and ramp to high volume manufacture of vehicle and retain current employee additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous company that have far greater financial resource than we do and start ups and emerging company that promise short term growth opportunity difficulty in retaining current employee or recruiting new one could have an adverse effect on our performance we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer chairman of our board of director and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla among other commitment mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle we are subject to various environmental and safety law and regulation that could impose substantial cost upon and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facility manufacturing company including with respect to facility such the tesla factory gigafactory and gigafactory we are subject to complex environmental health and safety law and regulation at numerous jurisdictional level in the united state and abroad including law relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous material the cost of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our property and any change to our operation mandated by new or amended law may be significant we may also face unexpected delay in obtaining permit and approval required by such law in connection with our manufacturing facility which would hinder our operation of these facility such cost and delay may adversely impact our business prospect and operating result furthermore any violation of these law may result in substantial fine and penalty remediation cost third party damage or suspension or cessation of our operation our business may be adversely affected by any disruption caused by union activity it is common for employee at company with significant manufacturing operation such to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage moreover regulation in some jurisdiction outside of the united state mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreement and work council with certain consultation right with respect to the relevant company operation although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employee they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such part supplier and trucking and freight company and work stoppage or strike organized by such union could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating result if work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our product and have material adverse effect on our business prospect operating result or financial condition our product and service are subject to substantial regulation which are evolving and unfavorable change or failure by to comply with these regulation could substantially harm our business and operating result motor vehicle are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local law we incur significant cost in complying with these regulation and may be required to incur additional cost to comply with any change to such regulation we are subject to law and regulation applicable to the import sale and service of automobile internationally for example in country outside of the united state we are required to meet vehicle specific safety standard that are often materially different from requirement in the united state thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance in those country this process may include official review and certification of our vehicle by foreign regulatory agency prior to market entry well compliance with foreign reporting and recall management system requirement additionally our vehicle are equipped with range of autopilot feature that assist driver relieving them of certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspect of road travel autopilot is recently introduced feature with which domestic and foreign regulator have limited experience any current or future proposed regulation in this area if passed could impact whether and our customer are able to use our vehicle equipped for autopilot and which depending on the severity of the regulation could adversely affect our business moreover provider of electricity generated by the solar energy system we install for customer we are impacted by federal state and local regulation and policy concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of customer generated electricity with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party owned system for example existing or proposed regulation and policy would permit utility to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customer with their solar energy system charge fee and penalty to our customer relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate design such that the price of our solar product may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict and our customer from transacting under our power purchase agreement or qualifying for government incentive and benefit that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulation and policy remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdiction or if other regulation and policy that facilitate the connection of our solar energy system to the grid are modified or eliminated they could deter potential customer from purchasing our solar product threaten the economics of our existing contract and cause to cease solar energy system sale and operation in the relevant jurisdiction which could harm our business prospect financial condition and result of operation we are subject to various privacy and consumer protection law our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by or our vendor or other business partner to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security law or regulation could result in regulatory or litigation related action against legal liability fine damage and other cost we may also incur substantial expense and cost in connection with maintaining compliance with such law in particular data protection law in the eu which are currently in state of transition although we take step to protect the security of our customer personal information we may be required to expend significant resource to comply with data breach requirement if third party improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customer or we otherwise experience data loss with respect to customer personal information major breach of our network security and system could have negative consequence for our business and future prospect including possible fine penalty and damage reduced customer demand for our vehicle and harm to our reputation and brand we may be compelled to undertake product recall or take other action which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition for example we initiated model recall in november after we discovered single field unit with front seat belt issue and model recall in april after an internal test revealed unintended movement in the third row seat during collision none of our past recall have been related to our electric powertrain in the future we may at various time voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recall if any of our product or our electric vehicle powertrain component that we provide to other vehicle oems including any system or part sourced from our supplier prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable law and regulation such federal motor vehicle safety standard such recall whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by system or component engineered or manufactured by or our supplier could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target market well our business prospect financial condition and result of operation our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim which could adversely affect our financial performance subject to separate limited warranty for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide four year or mile limited warranty for the purchaser of new model and model vehicle and pre owned model vehicle certified and sold by the limited warranty for the battery and drive unit cover the drive unit for eight year well the battery for period of eight year or for certain older vehicle mile if reached sooner than eight year although the battery charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranty or extended service plan in addition customer of new model and model vehicle have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicle to cover additional service for up to an additional four year or mile provided it is purchased within specified period of time for energy storage product we provide limited warranty against defect and to guarantee certain level of minimum energy retention for example we guarantee that each powerwall product will maintain at least of it stated capacity after year and that each powerpack product will retain specified minimum energy capacity in each of it first year of use subject to stated throughput cap we also offer extended warranty for period of up to year at additional cost at the time of purchase including capacity maintenance agreement available for the powerpack well workmanship warranty and system availability guarantee to customer who elect to have install their system or perform preventative maintenance service respectively finally customer who buy energy from under solar energy system lease or power purchase agreement are covered by warranty equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically year system purchased for cash are covered by warranty of up to year with extended warranty available at additional cost in addition we pas through to our customer the inverter and panel manufacturer warranty which generally range from to year subjecting to the risk that the manufacturer may later cease operation or fail to honor their underlying warranty finally we provide performance guarantee with our leased solar energy system that compensates customer on an annual basis if their system doe not meet the electricity production guarantee set forth in their lease if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our product our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserve include management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim such estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to product such model that are new and or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volume than our past product may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future we are currently expanding and improving our information technology system and use security measure designed to protect our system against breach and cyber attack if these effort are not successful our business and operation could be disrupted and our operating result and reputation could be harmed we are currently expanding and improving our information technology system including implementing new internally developed system to assist in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicle necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology system in the united state and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system the implementation maintenance and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sale and service process these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicle or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation we also maintain information technology measure designed to protect against system security risk data breach and cyber attack we can not be sure that these system or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these system planned our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result moreover our proprietary information could be compromised and our reputation may be adversely affected if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage while we currently maintain general liability automobile property worker compensation and director and officer insurance policy general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuation in our operating cost we expect our period to period financial result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will increase significantly in future period we among other thing design develop and manufacture model energy storage and solar product and other future product increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facility to produce vehicle at higher volume including ramping up the production of model and model expand gigafactory open new tesla store and service center with maintenance and repair capability open new supercharger location develop gigafactory increase our sale and marketing activity and increase our general and administrative function to support our growing operation result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our financial result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our financial result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst or investor if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time any unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicle system could result in loss of confidence in and our vehicle and harm our business our vehicle contain complex information technology system for example our vehicle are designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update the functionality of our vehicle we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology network our vehicle and their system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such network vehicle and system to gain control of or to change our vehicle functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle we encourage reporting of potential vulnerability in the security of our vehicle via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability accordingly we have received report of potential vulnerability in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerability will not be identified in the future or that our remediation effort are or will be successful any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicle or their system or any loss of data could result in legal claim or proceeding in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our vehicle their system or data well other factor that may result in the perception that our vehicle their system or data are capable of being hacked could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result we have been the subject of such report in the past servicing our indebtedness requires significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness of december we had outstanding in aggregate principal amount million of the note million of the note and billion of the note collectively the tesla convertible note in addition we have established senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement the credit agreement that allows to borrow under certain circumstance up to billion of december we had million in borrowing under the credit facility pursuant to the credit agreement we are also party to warehouse credit facility with lender commitment of million the warehouse facility of which we had borrowed million of december moreover of december our subsidiary solarcity corporation together with it subsidiary had total outstanding indebtedness of billion including under it credit facility the solarcity credit facility such outstanding indebtedness included million drawn under secured revolving credit facility with lender commitment of million of december including commitment expiring of such date which matures in december well million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior note due million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior note due and million in aggregate principal amount of zero coupon convertible senior note due collectively the solarcity convertible note our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry condition and we and our subsidiary may subject to the limitation in the term of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt pursuant to their term holder may convert their tesla convertible note at their option prior to the scheduled maturity of the respective tesla convertible note under certain circumstance the note have been convertible at their holder option during each quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of except the first quarter of upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible note we will be obligated to make cash payment in respect of the principal amount thereof and we may also have to deliver cash and or share of our common stock in respect of the conversion value in excess of such principal amount on such tesla convertible note for example of december we have repaid in cash approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the note due to early conversion the solarcity convertible note are also currently convertible into share of our common stock at conversion price ranging from to per share in addition holder of the tesla convertible note and the solarcity convertible note will have the right to require to repurchase their note upon the occurrence of fundamental change at purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the note plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payment upon conversion or repurchase demand with respect to our convertible note or to refinance our indebtedness we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payment may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activity or engage in these activity on desirable term or at all which could result in default on our existing or future indebtedness and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our debt agreement contain covenant restriction that may limit our ability to operate our business the term of our credit facility and or certain of the solarcity credit facility contain and any of our other future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction that limit our ability to operate our business including restriction on our ability to among other thing incur additional debt or issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock or make other restricted payment and make certain voluntary prepayment of specified debt in addition under certain circumstance we are required to comply with fixed charge coverage ratio result of these covenant our ability to respond to change in business and economic condition and engage in beneficial transaction including to obtain additional financing needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenant could result in default under our debt agreement which could permit the holder to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient fund available to repay it the classification of our convertible note may have an effect on our reported financial result our note and the solarcity convertible note have been historically and our note and note may become in the future convertible at the option of their holder prior to their scheduled term under certain circumstance even if holder do not elect to convert their convertible note if such note become convertible prior to their scheduled maturity date we would be required to reclassify such note and the related debt issuance cost current liability and certain portion of our equity outside of equity to mezzanine equity which would have an adverse impact on our reported financial result for such quarter and could have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock we may need or want to raise additional fund and these fund may not be available to when we need them if we can not raise additional fund when we need or want them our operation and prospect could be negatively affected the design manufacture sale installation and or servicing of automobile energy storage product and solar product is capital intensive business until we are consistently generating positive free cash flow we may need or want to raise additional fund through the issuance of equity equity related or debt security or through obtaining credit from financial institution to fund together with our principal source of liquidity the cost of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicle energy storage product and or solar product to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expense or for new significant strategic investment or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the term of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operation continue research and development project establish sale and service center build and deploy supercharger expand gigafactory develop gigafactory and to make the investment in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicle energy storage product and solar product we can not be certain that additional fund will be available to on favorable term when required or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially and adversely affected additionally we use capital from third party fund investor to reduce the cost of capital of our solar energy system installation improve our margin offset future reduction in government incentive and maintain the price competitiveness of our solar energy system the availability of this tax advantaged financing depends upon many factor including the confidence of the investor in the solar energy industry and the quality and mix of our customer contract any regulatory change impacting the economics of our existing customer contract change in legal and tax advantage or risk or government incentive associated with these financing and our ability to compete with other renewable energy company for the limited number of potential fund investor moreover interest rate are at historically low level if the rate of return required by investor rise result of rise in interest rate it will reduce the present value of the customer payment stream underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structure increasing our cost of capital if we are unable to establish new financing fund on favorable term for third party ownership arrangement to enable our customer access to our solar energy system with little or no upfront cost we may be unable to finance installation of our customer system or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted any of which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we may face regulatory limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicle we sell our vehicle directly to consumer we may not be able to sell our vehicle through this sale model in each state in the united state some state have law that may be interpreted to impose limitation on this direct to consumer sale model in certain state in which we are not able to obtain dealer license we have opened gallery which are not full retail location the application of these state law to our operation continues to be difficult to predict law in some state have limited our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and may continue to do so in addition decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle may be subject to challenge by dealer association and others to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law we have prevailed in many of these lawsuit and such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state law were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by vehicle dealer association to propose bill and regulation that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model few state have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate we have also filed lawsuit in federal court in michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state prohibition on direct sale applied to our business internationally there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claim which may be time consuming and could cause to incur substantial cost others including our competitor may hold or obtain patent copyright trademark or other proprietary right that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our product and service which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time the holder of such intellectual property right may assert their right and urge to take license and or may bring suit alleging infringement or misappropriation of such right we may consider the entering into licensing agreement with respect to such right although no assurance can be given that such license can be obtained on acceptable term or that litigation will not occur and such license could significantly increase our operating expense in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain component or intellectual property into the good and service we offer to pay substantial damage and or license royalty to redesign our product and service and or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event that we were required to take one or more such action our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claim whether or not valid could result in substantial cost negative publicity and diversion of resource and management attention our facility or operation could be damaged or adversely affected result of disaster our corporate headquarters the tesla factory and gigafactory are located in seismically active region in northern california and nevada if major disaster such earthquake or other event occur or our information system or communication network break down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product we may incur expense relating to such damage which could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition risk related to the ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock ha been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factor some of which are beyond our control our common stock ha experienced an intra day trading high of per share and low of per share over the last week the stock market in general and the market for technology company in particular ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those company broad market and industry factor may seriously affect the market price of company stock including regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following period of volatility in the overall market and the market price of particular company security security class action litigation ha often been instituted against these company for example shareholder litigation like this wa filed against in while the plaintiff complaint wa

develop manufacture lease and sell high performance fully electric vehicle well provide energy storage through the offering of powerpack and powerwall in addition through our acquisition of solarcity corporation we also provide solar energy system to residential and commercial customer result of our acquisition of solarcity we have reclassified the presentation of our historic energy storage product revenue and cost of revenue from service and other to energy generation and storage automotive we produce and sell our model sedan and our model sport utility vehicle we continue to enhance our vehicle offering with all wheel drive capability autopilot option internet connectivity and free over the air software update starting in the fourth quarter of we introduced second generation of autopilot which ha improved hardware and enhanced functionality including better safety and performance in our production capability continued to scale and gain operational efficiency during our production volume increased by year over year in the fourth quarter of we began delivering model sport utility vehicle in we greatly ramped the production and delivery of model also in the first quarter of we unveiled model lower priced sedan designed for the mass market which received significant interest to date we have substantially completed the design and prototype of model and are projecting to start production and delivery in the second half of energy generation and storage through our acquisition of solarcity corporation or solarcity on november we lease and sell solar energy system and sell renewable energy to our customer typically at price below utility rate our long term agreement with our customer generate predictable and reliable stream of cash flow the operating result of solarcity from the acquisition date of november through december are included in our consolidated statement of operation also in we introduced solar roof which we plan to begin selling and installing later in in addition to solar energy system we also sell energy storage product which consists of the powerwall for residential application and the powerpack for commercial industrial and utility scale application in we completed several of our grid scale energy storage project including the southern california edison mira loma substation and the american samoa island installation management opportunity challenge and risk and outlook automotive demand production and delivery during we improved our existing model sedan and model sport utility vehicle by introducing new variant that improve range performance safety and value we introduced several new feature including updating the front fascia of model in the second quarter of to expanding offering of our battery size to cater to wider range of consumer we expect to introduce further new vehicle variant and over the air functionality over time we also expect that the demand for our vehicle will continue to increase we improve our vehicle and expand our retail service and charging infrastructure and we develop new product in addition the introduction of model would also generate incremental demand by offering le expensive alternative during the third quarter of we discontinued our resale value guarantee program in north america the resale value guarantee wa originally introduced in to help to reassure customer that tesla vehicle would retain value over time we continue to make progress in increasing vehicle production for the year ended december we produced approximately vehicle an increase of from the prior year this increase wa achieved despite the fact that we faced challenge in with model production including part shortage in january we completed the acquisition of grohmann engineering gmbh german manufacturing company with expertise in automated production we expect this acquisition will facilitate and expand vehicle production in the first quarter of we announced our target to increase overall vehicle production level to vehicle in increasing production will require additional capital we have started the installation of model manufacturing equipment in fremont and at gigafactory and we are on track to support volume production and delivery in the second half of in addition to expanding our vehicle production and delivery we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicle over the next several quarter due to economy of scale material cost reduction and more efficient manufacturing the decreasing trend in cost of manufacturing vehicle is expected to improve total automotive gross margin over time and mitigate some of the higher ramp up cost associated with the launch of model we have achieved cost improvement through material cost reduction from both engineering and commercial action and increased manufacturing efficiency including better inventory control over utilization and minimization of scrapping material this is also evident through increased product reliability including vehicle battery and drive unit that resulted in reduction of our warranty expense in addition we expect that the acquisition of grohmann will further increase our production automation and efficiency in order to accommodate much larger fleet of customer vehicle we increase delivery and to provide timely customer service we are expanding our sale service and charging infrastructure worldwide in particular we continue to open new tesla retail and service location around the world of december we had total of sale and service location and expect our long term vehicle sale outside of north america to be over half of our worldwide total automotive revenue we have le experience in international market we may face difficulty meeting our future international expansion plan with respect to timing and expected sale energy generation and storage demand we believe that demand for our energy product will continue to increase we plan to reduce customer acquisition cost by cutting advertising spend and increasingly selling solar product in tesla store in the fourth quarter of we revealed the solar roof product of which we expect to begin production and installation later in in addition in the fourth quarter of we also announced our second generation energy storage product powerpack and powerwall which offer significant price advantage per kwh and higher energy density trend in cash flow capital expenditure and operating expense we plan to build vehicle in given this plan we continue to invest heavily in capital expenditure our capital expenditure need include expenditure for the tooling production equipment and construction of the model production line equipment to support cell production at the gigafactory well new retail location service center and supercharger location we expect to invest between billion and billion in capital expenditure ahead of the start of model production in of december and the net book value of our supercharger network wa million and million respectively and of december our supercharger network included location globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to continue to be minimal portion of total capital spending during we expect that this investment will grow our supercharger network greatly we allocate supercharger related expense to cost of total automotive revenue and selling general and administrative expense these cost were immaterial for all period presented we expect operating expense to grow in driven by engineering design and testing expense related to model supplier contract and higher sale and service cost associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence in addition we expect operating expense to increase result of the increased selling general and administrative expense incurred by our energy generation and storage segment we expect selling general and administrative expense to continue to increase in absolute dollar but decline over time percentage of revenue we focus on increasing operational efficiency while continuing to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we also expect total operating expense to decrease percentage of revenue automotive financing option we offer loan and lease for our vehicle in certain market in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution we offer resale value guarantee in connection with certain loan offered by financial institution during we discontinued the resale value guarantee in north america but continue to offer it in selected european and asian market resale value guarantee available for exercise during fiscal year total million in value vehicle delivery with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near term cash flow and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sale price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenue and cost into future period they are considered lease for accounting purpose while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if customer exercise the option to return the vehicle to we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicle under these program may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicle returned to may be higher than our estimate or we may be unable to resell the used car in timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flow based on current market demand for our car we estimate the resale price for our vehicle will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amount should market value of our vehicle or customer demand decrease these estimate may be impacted materially we currently offer vehicle lease in the directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity well through leasing partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in state and the district of columbia we also offer financing arrangement through our entity in canada germany and the leasing through both our captive financing entity and our leasing partner expose to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near term operating result by requiring the deferral of revenue and cost into future period under lease accounting in addition for lease offered directly from our captive financing entity but not for those offered through our leasing partner we only receive limited portion of cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offering including our lease financing option and the financial source to support them and to support the overall financing need of our customer to the extent that we are unable to arrange such option for our customer on term that are attractive our sale financial result and cash flow could be negatively impacted energy generation and storage financing option through solarcity we offer solar loan whereby third party lender provides financing directly to qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own solar energy system installed by we enter into standard solar energy system sale agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into loan agreement with one of the third party lender who finance the full purchase price we are not party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third party lender and the third party lender ha no recourse against with respect to the loan if we are unable to continue to offer third party financing or other financing alternative to our customer on competitive term our growth may slow and our financial and operating result may be adversely impacted

for both vehicle and energy storage product we broke ground on gigafactory in june began assembling our energy storage product in the first portion of the facility in the fourth quarter of and began production of lithium ion battery cell for our energy storage product in the first quarter of we continue to invest in construction of the building at gigafactory and in production equipment for battery module and pack production panasonic ha agreed to partner with on gigafactory with investment in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply with battery cell under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory at negotiated price these term convey right to use the production related asset defined within asc lease we will consider these leased asset beginning with the start of cell production in early this will result in recording the value of such asset within property plant and equipment net in our consolidated balance sheet with corresponding liability recorded to financing obligation for all supplier and partner for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory we will record the value of such asset on our consolidated balance sheet based on our current assessment of december approximately million is expected to be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet during the first quarter of although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future event could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory exceeding our current expectation and gigafactory taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate in addition we continue to expand production capacity at our fremont factory and are exploring additional production capacity in asia and europe gigafactory and manufacturing through our acquisition of solarcity we have an agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york for the construction of an approximately million square foot manufacturing facility capable of producing gigawatt of solar panel annually on an approximately acre site located in buffalo new york referred to gigafactory in december we entered into production pricing agreement phase the phase

photovoltaic pv cell and module for primarily at gigafactory and that we will purchase certain amount of pv cell and module form panasonic during the year term with the intent to produce pv cell and module totaling approximately gigawatt annually beginning in the term of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york among other thing require to comply with number of covenant during the term of the agreement any failure to comply with these covenant could obligate to pay significant amount to the foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we continue to remain on track with our progress at gigafactory our expectation to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operation may prove incorrect which could subject to significant expense to achieve the desired benefit critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state or gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the

and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all vehicle production powertrain component and system and energy generation and storage product we sell at the time of delivery we accrue for manufacturer warranty which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future for the solar energy system that we sell we provide warranty on the installation and component for period typically between to year the manufacturer warranty on the solar energy system component which is typically passed through to customer range from to year the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within month is classified current liability our warranty reserve do not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle and solar energy system accounted for operating lease or collateralized debt arrangement any cost to repair these vehicle and system are expensed incurred warranty expense is recorded component of cost of automotive revenue for automotive related sale and cost of energy generation and storage revenue for solar energy and storage system stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of estimated forfeiture the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affect the amount of aggregate compensation these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factor quarterly change in the estimated forfeiture rate can have significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement if revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility expected life and forfeiture rate which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in august our board of director granted stock option to our ceo the ceo grant the ceo grant consists of ten vesting tranche with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance condition and market condition assuming continued employment and service to through each vesting date each of the ten vesting tranche requires combination of one of the ten pre determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market capitalization of billion compared to the initial market capitalization of billion measured at the time of the ceo grant the term of the ceo grant is ten year so any tranche that remain unvested at the expiration of the ceo grant will be forfeited in addition unvested option will be forfeited if our ceo is no longer in that role whether for cause or otherwise we measured the fair value of the ceo grant using monte carlo simulation approach with the following assumption risk free interest rate of expected term of ten year expected volatility of and dividend yield of stock based compensation expense associated with the ceo grant is recognized for each pair of performance and market condition over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market condition beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of being met of december the market condition for seven vesting tranche and the following performance milestone were achieved and approved by our board of director and therefore five of ten tranche of the ceo grant were vested of such date successful completion of the model alpha prototype successful completion of the model beta prototype completion of the first model production vehicle aggregate vehicle production of vehicle and successful completion of the model alpha prototype of december the following performance milestone were considered probable of achievement successful completion of the model beta prototype completion of the first model production vehicle aggregate vehicle production of vehicle and aggregate vehicle production of vehicle we expect that the next performance milestone to be achieved will be the successful completion of the model beta prototype which would be achieved upon the determination by our board of director that an eligible prototype ha been completed candidate for such prototype are among the vehicle that we are currently building part of our ongoing testing of our model vehicle design and manufacturing process the above four performance milestone were considered probable of achievement we recorded stock based compensation expense of million million and million for the year ended december and additionally no cash compensation ha ever been received by our ceo for his service to the company income tax we are subject to federal and state tax in the united state and in many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan tax law regulation and administrative practice may be subject to change due to economic or political condition including fundamental change to the tax law applicable to corporate multinationals the many country in the european union and number of other country are actively considering change in this regard of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made principle of consolidation our consolidated financial statement reflect our account and operation and those of our subsidiary in which we have controlling financial interest in accordance with the provision of financial accounting standard board or fasb asc consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity or vie of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investor in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attribute associated with our solar energy system the typical condition for controlling financial interest ownership is holding majority of the voting interest of an entity however controlling financial interest may also exist in entity such vies through arrangement that do not involve controlling voting interest asc requires variable interest holder to consolidate vie if that party ha the power to direct the activity of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb loss of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefit from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate vie in which we have majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of number of vies we evaluate our relationship with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transaction and balance have been eliminated in consolidation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that solarcity enters into to finance the cost of solar energy system under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on our consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in our consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of our consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset business combination we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill the excess of the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability over the fair value of purchase consideration is recorded gain from bargain purchase in other income and expense net in our consolidated statement of operation when determining the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed management make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset and certain tangible asset such solar energy system acquired part of our solarcity acquisition critical estimate in valuing certain tangible and intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from the underlying asset and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate other estimate associated with the accounting for acquisition may change additional information becomes available regarding the asset acquired and liability assumed more fully discussed in note of note to consolidated financial statement included in item of this annual report on form

segment increased from million from the year ended december to million for the year ended december gross margin for the year ended december and were and the lower margin in compared to wa primarily due to product and regional mix shift greater percentage of sale were derived from vehicle model with lower average selling price and increased manufacturing cost related to the ramp in production of the small drive unit for dual motor model vehicle and start of model production obsolete inventory and lower zev credit revenue this margin decrease wa partially offset by an increasing amount of revenue from vehicle accounted for lease including direct lease vehicle and those under our resale value guarantee program which have significantly higher gross margin and from material cost saving service and other gross margin were also down year over year primarily driven by planned price reduction for powertrain sale to daimler energy generation and storage segment cost of energy generation

equivalent of million of december and consisted primarily of euro chinese yuan and canadian dollar source of cash are predominately from our delivery of vehicle proceeds from retail financing activity and sale of energy generation and storage product in addition through our acquisition of solarcity we expect to generate additional liquidity through the sale of solar energy system to customer and financing fund created to monetize the cash flow tax attribute and other incentive generated by solar energy system deployed under operating lease or power purchase agreement we expect that our current source of liquidity including cash and cash equivalent together with our current projection of cash flow from operating activity will provide with adequate liquidity over at least the next month based on our current plan we may raise fund in the future including through potential equity or debt offering subject to market condition and recognizing that we can not be certain that additional fund would be available to on favorable term or at all the amount and timing of fund that we may raise is undetermined and will vary based on number of factor including our liquidity need well access to current and future source of liquidity these current source of liquidity and cash flow enable to fund our ongoing operation and research and development project the initial investment in tooling and manufacturing capital for our planned model the continued construction of gigafactory and the expansion of our retail store service center and supercharger network we are planning to produce total vehicle in which is approximately double our prior growth plan we continually evaluate our capital expenditure need we expect to invest between billion and billion in capital expenditure ahead of the start of model production in part of the solarcity acquisition we have an agreement to spend or incur approximately billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period following full production at gigafactory we anticipate meeting these obligation through our operation at gigafactory and other operation within the state of new york over the year term of the agreement and we do not believe that we face significant risk of default capital resource of december we have the following credit facility available senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement the credit agreement up to the lesser of billion or the value of the secured asset determined monthly pursuant to the credit agreement reduced by the amount of letter of credit outstanding issued under the credit agreement of december the outstanding amount under the credit agreement is million loan and security agreement warehouse

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency risk we transact business globally in multiple currency our international revenue well cost and expense denominated in foreign currency expose to the risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate against the functional currency of our foreign subsidiary and against the dollar upon consolidation foreign exchange rate vary revenue and expense may be significantly impacted and we may record significant gain or loss on the remeasurement of monetary asset and liability including intercompany balance of december our largest currency exposure are from the euro japanese yen and british pound we recorded foreign exchange gain of million in other income expense net for the year ended december related to the impact of change in exchange rate on foreign currency denominated monetary asset and liability we considered the historical trend in currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that adverse change in exchange rate of for all currency could be experienced in the near term these reasonably possible adverse change in exchange rate of were applied to total monetary asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of december to compute the adverse impact these change would have had on our income before income tax in the near term these change would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income tax of approximately million recorded to other income expense net principally from intercompany and cash balance in november we implemented program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchase denominated in japanese yen the derivative instrument we use are foreign currency forward contract and are designated cash flow hedge with maturity date of month or le we do not enter into derivative contract for trading or speculative purpose we document each hedge relationship and ass it initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure it ongoing effectiveness on quarterly basis using regression analysis during the term of an effective hedge contract we record gain and loss within accumulated other comprehensive loss we reclassify these gain or loss to cost of automotive sale in the period the related finished good inventory is sold or over the depreciation period for those sale accounted for lease although our contract are considered effective hedge we may experience small amount of ineffectiveness due to

redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that solarcity enters into to finance the cost of solar energy system under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation book value hlbv method under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in our consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of our consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder our basic and diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholder by the weighted average share of common stock outstanding for the period potentially dilutive share which are based on the number of share underlying

senior note warrant issued may business combination we account for business acquisition under asc business combination the cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the asset given equity instrument issued and liability assumed at the acquisition date cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed incurred identifiable asset including intangible asset liability assumed including contingent liability in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business are also initially measured at fair value we recognize goodwill if the aggregate fair value of the total purchase consideration and the noncontrolling interest is in excess of the aggregate fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed we recognize bargain purchase gain in other income and expense net in our consolidated statement of operation if the aggregate fair value of the

receivables from financial institution and leasing company offering various financing product to our customer regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer and from maintenance service on vehicle owned by leasing company we provide an allowance against amount receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected we write off account receivable when they are deemed uncollectible we typically do not carry account receivable related to our vehicle and related sale customer payment are due prior to vehicle delivery except for the amount due from commercial financial institution for approved financing arrangement between our customer and the financial institution customer note receivable part of the solarcity acquisition we acquired certain customer note receivable under the legacy mypower loan program the outstanding balance net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amount are presented on our consolidated balance sheet component of prepaid expense and other current asset for the current portion and mypower customer note receivable net of current portion for the long term portion in determining the allowance and credit quality for customer note receivable we identify significant customer with known dispute or collection issue and also consider our historical level of credit loss and current economic trend that might impact the level of future credit loss customer note receivable that are individually impaired are charged off write off of allowance for loss of december there were no significant customer with known dispute or collection issue and the amount of potentially uncollectible amount wa insignificant accordingly we did not establish an allowance for loss against customer note receivable in addition there were no material non accrual or past due customer note receivable of december concentration of risk credit risk financial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalent restricted cash account receivable customer note receivable and interest rate swap our cash equivalent are primarily invested in money market fund with high credit quality financial institution in the

and leasing company offering various financing product to our customer sale of regulatory credit well the development and sale of powertrain component and system to automotive original equipment manufacturer oems in addition our account receivable were also derived from the sale of our energy generation and storage product including any receivables from leasing solar energy system well power purchase agreement the associated risk of concentration is mitigated by placing lien on the related solar energy system the associated risk of concentration for interest rate swap is mitigated by transacting with several highly rated multinational bank we maintain reserve for any amount that we consider to be uncollectable at december one customer represented approximately of our total account receivable balance at december the same customer represented approximately of our total account receivable balance supply risk the majority of our supplier are currently single source supplier despite effort to qualify and obtain component from multiple source whenever feasible the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of component from these supplier could lead to vehicle design change increased cost and delay in vehicle delivery to our customer which could hurt our relationship with our customer and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and material and adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system are recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about on current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result operating lease vehicle vehicle delivered under our resale value guarantee program vehicle that are leased part of our leasing program well any vehicle that are sold with significant buy back guarantee are classified operating lease vehicle the related revenue transaction are treated operating lease operating lease vehicle are recorded at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the expected operating lease term the total cost of operating lease vehicle recorded in the consolidated balance sheet of december and wa billion and billion accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicle of december and wa million and million solar energy system leased and to be leased we through the acquisition of solarcity are the operating lessor of the solar energy system under lease that qualify operating lease our lease are accounted for in accordance with asc lease to determine lease classification we evaluate lease term to determine whether there is transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term is greater than of the useful life or whether the present value of minimum lease payment exceed of the fair value at lease inception we utilize periodic appraisal to estimate useful life and fair value at lease inception and residual value at lease termination solar energy system are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows solar energy system leased to customer to year initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost lease term year solar energy system held for lease to customer are installed system pending interconnection with the respective utility company and will be depreciated solar energy system leased to customer when the respective system have been interconnected and placed in service solar energy system under construction represents system that are under installation which will be depreciated solar energy system leased to customer when the respective system are completed interconnected and subsequently leased to customer initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer lease agreement property plant and equipment property plant and equipment including leasehold improvement are recognized at cost le accumulated depreciation and amortization depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the related asset follows machinery equipment vehicle and office furniture to year building and building improvement to year computer equipment and software to

estimated productive life for tooling wa vehicle based on our current estimate of production leasehold improvement are amortized on straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the related lease upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in our consolidated statement of operation maintenance and repair expenditure are expensed incurred while major improvement that increase the functionality output or expected life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life land is not depreciated interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction capitalized interest on construction in progress is included in property plant and equipment net and is amortized over the life of the related asset furthermore we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purpose during the construction phase of certain long lived asset under build to suit lease arrangement because of our involvement with the construction our exposure to any potential cost overrun and our other commitment under the arrangement in these case we recognize build to suit lease asset under construction and corresponding build to suit lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet long lived asset including acquired intangible asset we review property and equipment long term prepayment and intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we measure recoverability of these asset by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate if property and equipment and intangible asset are considered to be impaired the impairment to be recognized equal the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds their fair value we have made no material adjustment to our long lived asset in any of the year presented intangible asset with definite life are amortized over their estimated useful life we amortize our acquired intangible asset on straight line basis with definite life over period ranging from two to thirty year in process research and development ipr is an intangible asset accounted an indefinite lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort during the development period we conduct an ipr impairment test annually and whenever event or change in fact and circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the ipr is impaired event which might indicate impairment include but are not limited to adverse cost factor deteriorating financial performance strategic decision made in response to economic market and competitive condition the impact of the economic environment on and our customer base and or other relevant event such change in management key personnel litigation or customer capitalization of software cost for cost incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize cost incurred during the application development stage cost related to preliminary project activity and post implementation activity are expensed incurred internal use software is amortized on straight line basis over it estimated useful life of three to ten year we evaluate the useful life of these asset on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance occur that could impact the recoverability of these asset foreign currency we determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiary and their operating division based on the primary currency in which they operate in case where the functional currency is not the dollar we recognize cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rate we apply to accumulated deficit including current period income or loss and the balance sheet for each subsidiary we apply daily functional currency rate to their income or loss and the month end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet beginning january the functional currency of each of our foreign subsidiary changed to their local country currency this change wa based on the culmination of fact and circumstance that have developed we expanded our foreign operation over the past year the adjustment of million attributable to the current rate translation of non monetary asset of the date of the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet foreign currency transaction gain and loss are result of the effect of exchange rate change on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency transaction gain and loss are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december and we recorded foreign currency transaction gain loss of million million and million warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and certified pre owned vehicle production powertrain component and system and energy product we sell in addition we also provide warranty on the installation and component of the solar energy system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within month is classified current within accrued liability and other while the remaining amount is classified long term within other long term liability accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the period presented in thousand year ended december accrued warranty beginning of period assumed warranty liability from acquisition warranty cost incurred net change in liability for pre existing warranty including expiration and foreign exchange impact provision for warranty accrued warranty end of period our warranty reserve do not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to lease accounting and solar energy system under lease contract or power purchase agreement the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the warranty reserve increased primarily due to incremental vehicle delivery offset by actual claim and an overall decrease in accrual rate for vehicle battery and drive unit due to improved reliability in addition for the year ended december we also assumed warranty liability of million result of the solarcity acquisition for the year ended december and december warranty cost incurred for vehicle accounted for operating lease or collateralized debt arrangement were million and million warranty expense is recorded component cost of revenue solar energy system performance guarantee solarcity guarantee certain specified minimum solar energy production output for certain solar energy system leased or sold to customer generally for term of up to year we monitor the solar energy system to ensure that these output are being achieved we evaluate if any amount are due to it customer and make any payment periodically specified in the customer contract of december we had recorded liability of million under accrued liability and other in our consolidated balance sheet relating to these guarantee based on our assessment of the current exposure solar renewable energy credit we account for solar renewable energy credit or srecs when they are purchased by or sold to third party for srecs generated by solar energy system owned by and minted by government agency we do not recognize any specifically identifiable cost for those srecs there are no specific incremental cost incurred to generate the srecs for srecs purchased by we carry these srecs at their cost subject to impairment testing we recognize revenue from the sale of an srec when the srec is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the srec if any is then recorded within cost of revenue deferred itcs revenue solarcity ha solar energy system that are eligible for investment tax credit or itcs that accrue to eligible property under the irc under section of the irc and the related regulation lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee the owner of such property for the purpose of claiming the itcs associated with such property these regulation enable the itcs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the itcs under the lease pas through fund arrangement solarcity can make tax election to pas through the itcs to the investor who is the legal lessee of the property we are therefore able to monetize these itcs to investor who can utilize them in return for cash payment we consider the monetization of itcs to constitute one of the key element of realizing the value associated with solar energy system we therefore view the proceeds from the monetization of itcs to be component of revenue generated from solar energy system for lease pas through fund arrangement solarcity allocates portion of the aggregate payment received from the investor to the estimated fair value of the assigned itcs and the balance to the future customer lease payment that are also assigned to the investor the estimated fair value of the itcs is determined by discounting the estimated cash flow impact of the itcs using an appropriate discount rate that reflects market interest rate we recognize the revenue associated with the monetization of itcs in accordance with asc the revenue associated with the monetization of the itcs is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred or service have been rendered the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured the itcs are subject to recapture under the irc if the underlying solar energy system either cease to be qualifying property or undergoes change in ownership within five year of it placed in service date the recapture amount decrease on the anniversary of the placed in service date we have an obligation to ensure the solar energy system is in service and operational for term of five year to avoid any recapture of the itcs we recognize revenue the recapture provision lapse assuming the other aforementioned revenue recognition criterion have been met the monetized itcs are initially recorded deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and subsequently one fifth of the monetized itcs is recognized revenue from operating lease and solar energy system incentive in our consolidated statement of operation on each anniversary of the solar energy system placed in service date over the next five year solarcity guarantee their financing fund investor that in the event of subsequent recapture of itcs by the taxing authority due to our noncompliance with the applicable itc guideline we would compensate them for any recaptured itcs we have concluded that the likelihood of recapture event is remote and consequently have not recorded any liability in our consolidated balance sheet for any potential recapture exposure recent accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no revenue from contract with customer topic which amends the existing accounting standard for revenue recognition the new guidance provides new model to determine when and over period revenue is recognized under this new model revenue is recognized good or service are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect in march the fasb issued an asu revenue from contract with customer principal versus agent

for period beginning after december the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application we have not yet selected transition method and are evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance in august the fasb issued asu no presentation of financial statement going concern disclosure of uncertainty about an entity ability to continue going concern asu asu requires management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity ability to continue going concern and if so provide certain footnote disclosure asu is effective for annual period ending after december including interim reporting period thereafter we adopted asu of december but it did not impact our consolidated financial statement in april the fasb issued an asu on simplifying the presentation of debt issuance cost which requires that debt issuance cost related to recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability consistent with debt discount we have retrospectively adopted the asu of march and result on our december consolidated balance sheet we reclassified million reduction in prepaid expense and other current asset along with million reduction in other asset with corresponding reduction in the aggregate carrying value of our long term debt liability similarly result of the change in carrying value of long term debt million wa reclassified out of additional paid in capital and into mezzanine equity on our december consolidated balance sheet in february the fasb issued asu no lease topic the asu is effective for reporting period beginning after december and early adoption is permitted the asu will require lessee to report most lease asset and liability on the balance sheet while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged the asu requires modified retrospective transition approach for existing lease whereby the new rule will be applied to the earliest year presented we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting the asu on our consolidated financial statement in march the fasb issued asu no compensation stock compensation topic improvement to employee share based payment accounting asu asu simplifies several aspect of the accounting for share based payment transaction including the income tax consequence classification of award either equity or liability and classification on the statement of cash flow asu will become effective for beginning with the first quarter of upon adoption of the asu we plan to account for forfeiture incurred the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement see note income tax for additional information regarding the impact of the adoption of this guidance in august the fasb issued

compensation result of our obligation to issue replacement award portion of the fair value based measure of replacement award is included in measuring the purchase consideration transferred in the business combination to determine the portion of the replacement award that is part of the purchase consideration we measured the fair value of both the replacement award and the historical award of

been rendered transaction cost of million were expensed incurred in selling general and administrative expense of our consolidated statement of operation fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed we accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for business combination under asc business combination the total purchase price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible asset acquired and liability and noncontrolling interest assumed based on their estimated fair value of the acquisition date we finalize the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed additional purchase price adjustment may be recorded during the measurement period period not to exceed month in fair value estimate are based on complex series of judgment about future event and uncertainty and rely heavily on estimate and assumption the judgment used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of asset acquired and liability assumed well asset life and the expected future cash flow and related discount rate can materiality impact our result of operation specifically we used discounted cash flow model to value the acquired solar energy system leased and to be leased well the noncontrolling interest in subsidiary significant input used for the model included the amount of cash flow the expected period of the cash flow and the discount rate the finalization of the purchase accounting assessment may result in change in the valuation of asset acquired liability assumed and tax may have material impact on our result of

noncontrolling interest assumed becomes available gain on acquisition the accounting guidance requires that gain resulting from the fair value of acquired net asset being greater than the consideration paid to acquire the net asset be recorded gain included in the result of operation on the acquisition date we recognized gain on acquisition of million in the fourth quarter of which is recorded in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of operation we reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable asset and liability acquired and concluded that all acquired asset and liability were recognized and that the valuation procedure and resulting estimate of fair value were appropriate the primary factor contributing to the gain relates to the change in the overall price of our common stock from the time that the merger agreement wa executed on july to the acquisition date during this time our stock price decreased from to which in turn reduced the

process research and development ipr is an intangible asset accounted for an indefinite lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development effort if the research and development effort associated with the ipr is successfully completed and commercial feasibility is reached then the ipr intangible asset will be amortized over it estimated useful life to be determined at the date the effort is completed the research and development effort associated with these ipr intangible asset are expected to be completed in the second half of the fair value of the ipr is determined using the replacement cost method under the cost approach the replacement cost is estimated based on the historical acquisition cost of the technology and historical expense incurred adjusted for an estimated developer profit opportunity cost and obsolescence factor in accordance with accepted valuation methodology at the time of acquisition we expect that all acquired ipr will reach technological feasibility but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability of these product will actually be achieved the nature of the effort to develop the acquired technology into commercially viable product consists principally of planning designing and testing the technology for viability in manufacturing if commercial viability were not achieved we would likely look to other alternative technology if the related project is not completed in timely manner or the project is terminated or abandoned we may have an impairment related to the ipr calculated

that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant such fair value is market based measurement that should be determined based on assumption that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability basis for determining the fair value of certain of our asset and liability we follow three tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the input used in measuring fair value follows level observable input such quoted price in active market level ii input other than the quoted price in active market that are observable either directly or indirectly and level iii unobservable input in which there is little or no market data which requires to develop our own assumption this hierarchy requires to use observable market data when available and to minimize the use of unobservable input when determining fair value our financial asset and financial liability that are measured at fair value on recurring basis consist of cash equivalent marketable security and interest rate swap of december and the fair value hierarchy for our financial asset and financial liability that are carried at fair value wa follows and unrealized gain loss on financial asset and liability presented in the table below for all period presented were le than million in thousand december december fair value level level ii level iii fair value level level ii level iii money market fund treasury bill interest rate swap total all of our cash equivalent and current restricted cash which are comprised primarily of money market fund are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market price or market price for identical security our restricted short term marketable security are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy we have classified the interest rate swap within level ii because their fair value are determined using alternative pricing source or model that utilized market observable input including current and forward interest rate during the year ended december and there were no transfer between the level of the fair value hierarchy derivative financial instrument cash flow hedge in november we implemented program to hedge the foreign currency exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchase denominated in japanese yen the derivative instrument we use are foreign currency forward contract and are designated cash flow hedge with maturity date of month or le we do not enter into derivative contract for trading or speculative purpose the bank counterparties in all contract expose tesla to credit related loss in the event of their nonperformance however to mitigate that risk tesla only contract with counterparties who meet the company minimum requirement under it counterparty risk assessment process tesla monitor rating credit spread and potential downgrade on at least quarterly basis based on our on going assessment of counterparty risk the company will adjust it exposure to various counterparties we generally enter into master netting arrangement which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty however we do not have any master netting arrangement in place with collateral feature we document each hedge relationship and ass it initial effectiveness at the inception of the hedge contract and we measure it ongoing effectiveness on quarterly basis using regression analysis during the term of an effective hedge contract we record gain and loss within accumulated other comprehensive income loss we reclassify these gain or loss to cost of automotive revenue in the period the related finished good inventory is sold or cost of automotive leasing revenue over the depreciation period for those sale accounted for lease although our contract are considered effective hedge we may experience small amount of ineffectiveness due to timing difference between our actual inventory purchase and the settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contract we have recorded no amount related to hedge ineffectiveness within other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operation during the year ended december and there were no outstanding hedging contract of december the net notional amount of these contract wa million at december outstanding contract are recognized either asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value within prepaid expense

nondeductible expense foreign income rate differential tax credit noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest adjustment investment in certain financing bond other reconciling item change in valuation allowance provision for income tax of december we recorded valuation allowance of billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax increased by million during the year ended december the valuation allowance increase is primarily due to additional deferred tax asset incurred in the current year that can not be realized inclusive of million increase relating to the solarcity acquisition and offset by immaterial valuation allowance release in foreign jurisdiction management belief that based on the available information it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized such that full valuation allowance is required against all deferred tax asset we have net million of deferred tax asset in foreign jurisdiction which we believe are more likely than not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdiction of december we had approximately billion of federal and billion of state net operating loss carry forward available to offset future taxable income which will not begin to significantly expire until for federal and for state purpose portion of these loss were generated by solarcity prior to our acquisition and therefore are subject to change of control provision which limit the amount of acquired tax attribute that can be utilized in given tax year we do not expect these change of control limitation to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attribute the portion of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock option is approximately billion and billion for federal and state purpose respectively of which the tax benefit will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized upon the adoption of asu no all tax effect related to share based payment will be recognized through earnings subject to normal valuation allowance consideration we expect that any potential tax benefit upon adoption of asu no would increase our deferred tax asset which would be offset with full valuation allowance we have research and development tax credit of approximately million and million for federal and state income tax purpose respectively if not utilized the federal research and development tax credit will expire in various amount beginning in however the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely in addition we have other general business tax credit of approximately million for federal income tax purpose which will not begin to significantly expire until the company ha an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign earnings of december in addition we have not recognized deferred tax liability for the remittance of any undistributed foreign earnings to the united state such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operation outside the united state federal and state law can impose substantial restriction on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forward in the event of an ownership change defined in section of the internal revenue code we determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry forward due to any prior ownership change uncertain tax position the aggregate change in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefit during the year ended december and were follows in thousand january increase in balance related to prior year tax position increase in balance related to current year tax position december increase in balance related to prior year tax position increase in balance related to current year tax position december increase in balance related to prior year tax position increase in balance related to current year tax position assumed uncertain tax position through acquisition december accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are classified income tax expense and wa immaterial of december unrecognized tax benefit of million if recognized would not affect our effective tax rate the tax benefit would increase deferred tax asset which is currently fully offset with full valuation allowance we do not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within the next month we file income tax return in the united state california various state and foreign jurisdiction tax year to remain subject to examination for federal purpose and tax year to remain subject to examination for

note lease pas through financing obligation we are contractually committed to compensate certain fund investor for any loss that they may suffer in certain limited circumstance resulting from

obligation based on all the information available at that time including any guideline issued by the treasury department on solar energy system valuation for purpose of claiming treasury grant and any audit undertaken by the irs we believe that any payment to the fund investor in excess of the amount already recognized by for this obligation are not probable based on the fact known at the reporting date the maximum potential future payment that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair value of the solar energy system sold or transferred to the fund determined by and the value that the treasury department would determine fair value for the system for purpose of claiming treasury grant or the value the irs would determine the fair value for the system for purpose of claiming itcs or treasury grant we claim treasury grant based on guideline provided by the treasury department and the statutory regulation from the irs we use fair value determined with the assistance of independent third party appraisal commissioned by the basis for determining the itcs that are passed through to and claimed by the fund investor since we can not
