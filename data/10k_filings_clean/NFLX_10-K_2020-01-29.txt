affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business our service and others like gain traction in international market government are increasingly looking to introduce new or extend legacy regulation to these service in particular those related to broadcast medium and tax for example recent change to european law enables individual member state to impose levy and other financial obligation on medium operator located outside their jurisdiction we anticipate that several jurisdiction may over time impose greater financial and regulatory obligation on in addition the continued growth and development of the market for online commerce may lead to more stringent consumer protection law which may impose additional burden on if we are required to comply with new regulation or legislation or new interpretation of existing regulation or legislation this compliance could cause to incur additional expense or alter our business model of contentschanges in law or regulation that adversely affect the growth popularity or use of the internet including law impacting net neutrality could decrease the demand for our service and increase our cost of business certain law intended to prevent network operator from discriminating against the legal traffic that traverse their network have been implemented in many country including across the european union in others the law may be nascent or non existent furthermore favorable law may change including for example in the united state where net neutrality regulation were repealed given uncertainty around these rule including changing interpretation amendment or repeal coupled with potentially significant political and economic power of local network operator we could experience discriminatory or anti competitive practice that could impede our growth cause to incur additional expense or otherwise negatively affect our business change in how network operator handle and charge for access to data that travel across their

consumer with access to the internet also provide these consumer with multichannel video programming such many network operator have an incentive to use their network infrastructure in manner adverse to our continued growth and success while we believe that consumer demand regulatory oversight and competition will help check these incentive to the extent that network operator are able to provide preferential treatment to their data opposed to or otherwise implement discriminatory network management practice our business could be negatively impacted the extent to which these incentive limit

for the full year inclusive of this fourth quarter adjustment the increase in our effective tax rate for the year ended december compared to the year ended december is primarily due to the global corporate structure simplification lower benefit from the recognition of excess tax benefit of stock based compensation and lower benefit on percentage basis from federal and california research and development credit the one time transition tax benefit under staff accounting bulletin no sab that provided measurement period to address the gaap impact associated with the tax cut and job act of is no longer applicable in in the difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate of wa primarily due to the recognition of excess tax benefit of stock based compensation federal and california credit and the international provision from the tax reform enacted in partially offset by state tax foreign tax and non deductible expense of contentsliquidity and capital resource year ended december in thousand cash cash equivalent and restricted cash term cash equivalent and restricted cash increased million in the year ended december primarily due to the issuance of debt partially offset by cash used in operation long term debt net of debt issuance cost increased million due to long term note issuance in the earliest maturity date for our outstanding long term debt is february of december no amount had been borrowed under our million revolving credit agreement see note long term debt in the accompanying note to our consolidated financial statement we anticipate continuing to finance our future capital need in the debt market our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose to or need to obtain will depend on among other thing our development effort business plan operating performance and the condition of the capital market at the time we seek financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term acceptable to or at all if we raise additional fund through the issuance of equity or debt security those security may have right preference or privilege senior to the right of our common stock and our stockholder may experience dilution our primary us of cash include the acquisition licensing and production of content streaming delivery marketing program and personnel related cost cash payment term for non original content have historically been in line with the amortization period investment in original content and in particular content that we produce and own require more cash upfront relative to licensed content for example production cost are paid the content is created well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized we expect to continue to significantly increase our investment in global streaming content particularly in original content which will impact our liquidity and result in future net cash used in operating activity and negative free cash flow for many year we currently anticipate that cash flow from operation available fund and access to financing source including our revolving credit facility will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash need for at least the next twelve month free cash flowwe define free cash flow cash provided by used in operating and investing activity excluding the non operational cash flow from purchase maturity and sale of short term investment we believe free cash flow is an important liquidity metric because it measure during given period the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligation make investment and for certain other activity or the amount of cash used in operation including investment in global streaming content free cash flow is considered non gaap financial measure and should not be considered in isolation of or substitute for net income operating income cash flow used in operating activity or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap in assessing liquidity in relation to our result of operation we compare free cash flow to net income noting that the three major recurring difference are excess content payment over amortization non cash stock based compensation expense and other working capital difference working capital difference include deferred revenue excess property and equipment purchase over depreciation tax and semi annual interest payment on our outstanding debt our receivables from member generally settle quickly of content year ended december in thousand net cash used in operating activity net cash provided by used in investing activity cash provided by financing non gaap free cash flow reconciliation net cash used in operating activity purchase of property and equipment change in other asset free cash flow net cash used in operating activity increased million from the year ended december to million for the year ended december the increased use of cash wa primarily driven by the increase in investment in streaming content that require more upfront payment partially offset by million or increase in revenue the payment for streaming content asset increased million from million to million or compared to the increase in the amortization of streaming content asset of million from million to million or in addition we had increased payment associated with higher operating expense primarily related to increased headcount to support our continued improvement in our streaming service our international expansion and increased content production activity net cash used in investing activity increased million primarily due to an increase in purchase of property and equipment net cash provided by financing activity increased million due to an increase in the proceeds from the issuance of debt of million from million in the year ended december to million in the year ended december in addition we had decrease in the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million free cash flow wa million lower than net income for the year ended december primarily due to million of cash payment for streaming content asset over streaming amortization expense and million in other non favorable working capital difference partially offset by million of non cash stock based compensation expense contractual obligationsfor the purpose of this table contractual obligation for purchase of good or service are defined agreement that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction the expected timing of the payment of the obligation discussed is estimated based on

unknown obligation are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately billion to billion over the next three year with the payment for the vast majority of such amount expected to occur after the next twelve month the foregoing range is based on considerable management judgment and the actual amount may differ once we know the title that we will receive and the license fee

statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reported period the security and exchange commission sec ha defined company critical accounting policy the one that are most important to the portrayal of company financial condition and result of operation and which require company to make it most difficult and subjective judgment based on this definition we have identified the critical accounting policy and judgment addressed below we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ from these estimate of contentsstreaming content we acquire license and produce content including original programing in order to offer our member unlimited viewing of entertainment the content license are for fixed fee and specific window of availability payment term for certain content license and the production of content require more upfront cash payment relative to the amortization expense payment for content including addition to streaming asset and the change in related liability are classified within net cash used in operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flow we recognize content asset licensed and produced non current content asset net on the consolidated balance sheet for license we capitalize the fee per title and record corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begin the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming for production we capitalize cost associated with the production including development cost direct cost and production overhead participation and residual are expensed in line with the amortization of production cost based on factor including historical and estimated viewing pattern we amortize the content asset licensed and produced in cost of revenue on the consolidated statement of operation over the shorter of each title contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten year beginning with the month of first availability the amortization is on an accelerated basis we typically expect more upfront viewing for instance due to additional merchandising and marketing effort and film amortization is more accelerated than tv series amortization on average over of licensed or produced streaming content asset is expected to be amortized within four year after it month of first availability we review factor that impact the amortization of the content asset on regular basis our estimate related to these factor require considerable management judgment our business model is subscription based opposed to model generating revenue at specific title level content asset licensed and produced are predominantly monetized group and therefore are reviewed at group level when an event or change in circumstance indicates change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be le than unamortized cost to date we have not identified any such event or change in circumstance if such change are identified in the future these aggregated content asset will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value in addition unamortized cost for asset that have been or are expected to be abandoned are written off income taxeswe record provision for income tax for the anticipated tax consequence of our reported result of operation using the asset and liability method deferred income tax are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rate applicable to future year to difference between the financial statement carrying amount of existing asset and liability and their respective tax base well net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the effect on deferred tax asset and liability of change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the measurement of deferred tax asset is reduced if necessary by valuation allowance for any tax benefit for which future realization is uncertain although we believe our assumption judgment and estimate are reasonable change in tax law or our interpretation of tax law and the resolution of any tax audit could significantly impact the amount provided for income tax in our consolidated financial statement in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax asset in full or in part we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating result and our forecast of future earnings future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy the assumption utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plan and estimate we are using to manage the underlying business actual operating result in future year could differ from our current assumption judgment and estimate however we believe that it is more likely than not that most of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be realized we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized at december the valuation allowance of million wa primarily related to foreign tax credit that we are not expected to realize we did not recognize certain tax benefit from uncertain tax position within the provision for income tax we may recognize tax benefit if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement at december our estimated gross unrecognized tax benefit were million of which million if recognized would favorably impact our future earnings due to uncertainty in any tax audit outcome our estimate of the ultimate settlement of our unrecognized tax position may change and the actual tax benefit may differ significantly from the estimate see note to the consolidated financial
