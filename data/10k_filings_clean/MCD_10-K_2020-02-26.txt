condition and result of operation is based upon the company consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the the preparation of these financial statement requires the company to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well related disclosure on an ongoing basis the company evaluates it estimate and judgment based on historical experience and various other factor that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ from these estimate the company review it financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company belief that of it significant accounting policy the following involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipmentproperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on straight line basis over their useful life based on management estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus option for leased property the useful life are estimated based on historical experience with similar asset taking into account anticipated technological or other change the company periodically review these life relative to physical factor economic factor and industry trend if there are change in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological change occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful life assigned to these asset may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future period leasing arrangementsthe company is the lessee in significant real estate portfolio primarily through ground lease the company lease the land and generally owns the building and through improved lease the company lease the land and building the right of use asset and lease liability reflect the present value of the company estimated future minimum lease payment over the lease term which includes option that are reasonably assured of exercised discounted using collateralized incremental borrowing rate typically renewal option are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if the associated asset life of the building or leasehold improvement exceed that of the initial lease term and the sale performance of the restaurant remains strong therefore the right of use asset and lease liability include an assumption on renewal option that have not yet been exercised by the company the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable the company us an incremental borrowing rate to calculate the lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the company would incur to borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease within particular currency environment share based compensationthe company ha share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentive including stock option and restricted stock unit rsus to employee and nonemployee director the expense for these equity based incentive is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period the company estimate forfeiture when determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each period the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using closed form pricing model the pricing model requires assumption which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the risk free interest rate expected volatility of the company stock over the expected life and the expected dividend yield the company us historical data to determine these assumption and if these assumption change significantly for future grant share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future year the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company stock at date of grant and prior to included reduction for the present value of expected dividend over the vesting period for performance based rsus the company includes relative total shareholder return tsr modifier to determine the number of share earned at the end of the performance period the fair value of performance based rsus that include the tsr modifier is determined using monte carlo valuation model long lived asset impairment reviewlong lived asset including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company long lived asset the company considers change in economic condition and make assumption regarding estimated future cash flow and other factor estimate of future cash flow are highly subjective judgment based on the company experience and knowledge of it operation these estimate can be significantly impacted by many factor including change in global and local business

referendum in the and or other european country that could cause uncertainty in european or worldwide economic condition the decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rate that may or may not continue and may result in increased supply chain cost for item that are imported from other country any of these effect and others we can not anticipate could adversely affect our

resolution of tax matter could have material adverse impact on our financial result change in commodity and other operating cost could adversely affect our result of operation the profitability of our company operated restaurant depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to change in commodity cost including food paper supply fuel utility and distribution and other operating cost including labor any volatility in certain commodity price or fluctuation in labor cost could adversely affect our operating result by impacting restaurant profitability the commodity market for some of the ingredient we use such beef and chicken are particularly volatile due to factor such seasonal shift climate condition industry demand international commodity market food safety concern product recall and government regulation all of which are beyond our control and in many instance unpredictable we can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activity and therefore
