contentscompetitionthe wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive we are the third largest provider of postpaid service plan and the largest provider of prepaid service plan in the measured by customer our competitor include other national carrier such at inc at verizon communication inc verizon and sprint corporation sprint at and verizon are significantly larger than and enjoy greater resource and scale advantage compared to in addition our competitor include numerous smaller regional carrier existing mvnos including tracfone wireless inc and comcast corporation comcast and future mvnos such charter communication inc many of which offer or plan to offer no contract postpaid and prepaid service plan competitor also include provider who offer similar communication service such voice messaging and data service using alternative technology or service competitive factor within the wireless telecommunication industry include pricing market saturation service and product offering customer experience network investment and quality development and deployment of technology availability of additional spectrum license and regulatory change competitor have shown willingness to use aggressive pricing source of differentiation other competitor have sought to add ancillary service like mobile video to enhance their offering taken together the competitive factor we face continue to put pressure on growth and margin company compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customer employeesas of december we employed approximately full time and part time employee including network retail administrative and customer support function regulation the fcc regulates many key aspect of our business including licensing construction the operation and use of our network modification of our network control and ownership of our license and authorization the sale transfer and acquisition of certain license domestic roaming arrangement and interconnection agreement pursuant to it authority under the communication act of amended communication act the fcc ha number of complex requirement and proceeding that affect our operation and that could increase our cost or diminish our revenue for example the fcc ha rule regarding provision of and service porting telephone number interconnection roaming internet openness or net neutrality disability access privacy and cybersecurity consumer protection and the universal service and lifeline program many of these and other issue are considered in ongoing proceeding and we can not predict whether or such action will affect our business financial condition or result of operation our ability to provide service and generate revenue could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or change to existing law and regulation in addition regulation of company that offer competing service can impact our business indirectly wireless communication provider must be licensed by the fcc to provide communication service at specified spectrum frequency within specified geographic area and must comply with the rule and policy governing the use of the spectrum adopted by the fcc the fcc issue each license for fixed period of time typically year in the case of cellular pc and point to point microwave license aws license have an initial term of year with successive year term thereafter the fcc ha generally renewed license given to operating company like the fcc ha authority to both revoke license for cause and to deny license renewal if renewal is not in the public interest furthermore we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty for failure to comply with fcc regulation even if any such non compliance wa unintentional in extreme case penalty can include revocation of our license the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition additionally congress and the fcc allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service cmrs which includes cellular pc and specialized mobile radio could significantly increase competition we can not ass the impact that any development that may occur in the economy or any future spectrum allocation by the fcc may have on license value fcc spectrum auction and other market development may adversely affect the market value of our license in the future significant decline in the value of our license could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition the fcc periodically review it policy on how to evaluate carrier spectrum holding change in these policy could affect spectrum resource and competition among and other carrier congress and the fcc have imposed limitation on foreign ownership of cmrs licensee that exceed direct ownership or indirect ownership the fcc ha ruled that higher level of indirect foreign ownership even up to are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review consistent with that established policy the fcc ha issued declaratory ruling authorizing up to ownership of our company by deutsche telekom this declaratory ruling and our license are conditioned on deutsche telekom and the company compliance with network security agreement of contentswith the department of justice the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security failure to comply with the term of this agreement could result in fine injunction and other penalty including potential revocation of our spectrum license while the communication act generally preempt state and local government from regulating the entry of or the rate charged by wireless communication provider certain state and local government regulate other term and condition of wireless service including billing termination of service arrangement and the imposition of early termination fee advertising network outage the use of device while driving zoning and land use additionally the federal trade commission ftc and other federal agency have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of non common carrier service further the fcc and the federal aviation administration regulate the siting lighting and construction of transmitter tower and antenna tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning well federal statute regarding environmental and historic preservation the future cost to comply with all relevant regulation are to some extent unknown and change to regulation or the applicability of regulation could result in higher operating and capital expense or reduced revenue in the

section of our website at investor mobile com the information on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnishes to the sec item risk factorsin addition to the other information contained in this form the following risk factor should be considered carefully in evaluating mobile our business financial condition liquidity or operating result well the price of our common stock and other security could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk risk related to our business and the wireless industrycompetition industry consolidation and change in the market for wireless service could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customer and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we have multiple wireless competitor some of which have greater resource than and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network coverage speed and quality and customer service we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rate or possibly negative leading to ongoing competition for customer we also expect that our customer appetite for data service will place increasing demand on our network capacity this competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to compete will depend on among other thing continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service effective marketing and selling of product and service innovation attractive pricing and cost management all of which will involve significant expense joint venture merger acquisition and strategic alliance in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitor competing for limited number of customer the two largest national wireless communication provider currently serve significant percentage of all wireless customer and hold significant spectrum and other resource our largest competitor may be able to enter into exclusive handset device or content arrangement execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaign or otherwise improve their cost position relative to in addition refusal of our large competitor to provide critical access to resource and input such roaming service on reasonable term could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile service industry we face intense and increasing competition from other service provider industry sector converge such cable telecom service and content satellite and other service provider company like comcast and at and at proposed acquisition of time warner inc will have the scale and asset to aggressively compete in converging industry verizon through the acquisition of aol inc and yahoo inc is also significant competitor focusing on premium content offering to diversify outside of core wireless further some of our competitor provide content service in addition to voice and of contentsbroadband service and consumer are increasingly accessing video content from internet based provider and application all of which create increased competition in this area these factor together with the effect of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless service in all metropolitan area and the ability of our larger competitor to use resource to build out their network and to quickly deploy advanced technology could make it more difficult for to continue to attract and retain customer and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow which would have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulation relating to spectrum use may adversely affect our business strategy and financial condition and operating result we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth expand and deepen our coverage maintain our quality of service meet increasing customer demand and deploy new technology we will be at competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain market if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum reaching network capacity result we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum which could be significant the continued interest in and acquisition of spectrum by existing carrier and others may reduce our ability to acquire and or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other mean including government auction we may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangement which are subject to certain risk and uncertainty and may involve significant expenditure gaining access to the spectrum we in the fcc mhz auction in may take up to three year or more any material delay could adversely impact our ability to implement our plan and effort to improve our network in addition our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customer and to provide additional service and usage to existing customer result the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be much we anticipate or take longer than expected additionally we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market on favorable term or at all the fcc may impose condition on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area additional condition that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build out requirement limited license term or renewal right and clearing obligation that may make it le attractive or le economical to acquire spectrum in addition rule may be established for future government spectrum auction that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area if we can not acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise if competitor acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide service competitive with our service or if we can not deploy service over acquired spectrum on timely basis without burdensome condition at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality level our ability to attract and retain customer and our associated financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to take advantage of technological development on timely basis we may experience decline in demand for our service or face challenge in implementing or evolving our business strategy significant technological change continue to impact the communication industry in general these technological change enhance communication and enable broader array of company to offer service competitive with ours in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technology in our industry we will need to adapt to future change in technology continually invest in our network enhance our existing offering and introduce new offering to address our current and potential customer changing demand enhancing our network such deploying is subject to risk from equipment change and migration of customer from existing spectrum band and the potential inability to secure spectrum necessary to deploy advanced technology adopting new and sophisticated technology may result in implementation issue such scheduling and supplier delay unexpected or increased cost technological constraint regulatory permitting issue customer dissatisfaction and other issue that could cause delay in launching new technological capability which in turn could result in significant cost or reduce the anticipated benefit of the upgrade in general the development of new service in the wireless telecommunication industry will require to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demand of our customer which we may not be able to do accurately or timely if our new service fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if cost associated with these service are higher than anticipated this could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result of contentswe could be harmed by data loss or other security breach whether directly or by way of third

integrity of confidential information and such breach can have materially adverse effect on our business or damage our reputation cyber attack such denial of service and other malicious attack could disrupt our internal system and application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and have other adverse effect on our business and that of others who depend on our service telecommunication carrier we are considered critical infrastructure provider and therefore may be more likely to be the target of such attack such attack company may be perpetrated by variety of group or person including those in jurisdiction where law enforcement measure to address such attack are ineffective or unavailable and such attack may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign government in addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third party service provider when it is necessary to pursue business objective we and our third party service provider have been subject to unauthorized access to confidential information in the past including breach at one of our credit check provider in september in which subset of record containing current and potential customer information wa compromised by an external party our procedure and safeguard to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attack seeking to disrupt our service must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever evolving threat landscape we can not make assurance that all preventive action taken will adequately repel significant attack or prevent information security breach or the misuse of data unauthorized access by third party or employee or exploit against third party supplier environment if we are subject to such attack or security breach we may incur significant cost be subject to regulatory investigation sanction and private litigation experience disruption to our operation or suffer damage to our reputation any

service provider or third party retailer fail to comply with their contract or become unable to continue provision of service or supply our business could also be disrupted if we experience delay or service degradation during any transition to new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied product or service with those from another source especially if

accounting policy are fundamental to understanding our result of operation and financial condition they require that we use estimate and assumption that may affect the value of our asset or liability and financial result see note summary of significant accounting policy of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this form for further information six of these policy are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgment about matter that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amount would be reported under different condition or using different assumption actual result could differ from those estimate management and the audit committee of the board of director have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policy of contentsallowanceswe maintain an allowance for credit loss which is management estimate of such loss inherent in the receivables portfolio comprised of account receivable and eip receivable segment change in the allowance for credit loss and therefore in related provision for credit loss bad debt expense can materially affect earnings credit risk characteristic are assessed for each receivable segment in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit loss management considers number of factor including customer behavior credit quality of the customer base and other qualitative factor such macro economic condition while our methodology attribute portion of the allowance to specific portfolio segment the entire allowance for credit loss is available to absorb credit loss inherent in the total receivables portfolio management also considers an amount that represents management judgment of risk inherent in the process and assumption used in establishing the allowance for credit loss including process risk and other subjective factor including industry trend and emerging risk assessment to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trend or assumption the appropriate allowance level for realized credit loss could differ from the estimate we write off account balance if collection effort are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible based on customer credit rating and the length of time from the original billing date we offer certain retail customer the option to pay for their device and other purchase in installment over period of up to month using zero interest eip at the time of an installment sale we impute discount for interest and record the eip receivables at their present value which is determined by discounting future payment at the imputed interest rate the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount result in discount which is recorded direct reduction to the carrying value of the eip receivable with corresponding reduction to equipment revenue the imputed discount rate is primarily comprised of current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables result we do not recognize separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance the effect of uncertainty about future cash flow are included in the initial present value measurement of the eip receivable the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized other revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount we recognize an allowance for credit loss to the extent the amount of estimated credit loss on the gross eip receivable segment exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balance total imputed discount and allowance of december and wa approximately and respectively of the total amount of gross account receivable including eip receivables depreciationdepreciation commences asset have been placed in service we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to mobile which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected loss depreciable life study are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable life for certain category of property plant and equipment these study consider actual usage physical wear and tear replacement history and assumption about technology evolution when these factor indicate that an asset useful life is different from the previous assessment the remaining book value are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life see note summary of significant accounting policy and note property and equipment of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item of this form for information regarding depreciation of asset including management underlying estimate of useful life evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment we ass the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that asset might be impaired when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment for reporting unit to determine if quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative of contentsassessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor change in market capitalization to determine whether decline if any necessitate an interim impairment review in the event market capitalization doe decline below it book value we will consider the length severity and reason for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists including considering whether control premium should be added to the market capitalization we believe short term fluctuation in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value we test spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with the management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the carrying amount of spectrum license exceeds the fair value an impairment loss is recognized we estimate the fair value of the spectrum license using the greenfield approach which is an income approach that estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition the greenfield approach value the spectrum license by calculating the cash flow generating potential of hypothetical start up company that go into business with no asset except the asset to be valued in this case spectrum license the value of the spectrum license can be considered equal to the present value of the cash flow of this hypothetical start up company we base the assumption underlying the greenfield approach on combination of market participant data and our historical result trend and business plan future cash flow in the greenfield approach are based on estimate and assumption of market participant revenue ebitda margin network build out period and long term growth rate for market participant the cash flow are discounted using weighted average cost of capital the valuation approach utilized to estimate fair value for the purpose of the impairment test of goodwill and spectrum license require the use of assumption and estimate which involve degree of uncertainty if actual result or future expectation are not consistent with the assumption this may result in the recording of significant impairment charge on goodwill or spectrum license the most significant assumption within the valuation model are the discount rate revenue ebitda margin capital expenditure and the long term growth rate see note summary of significant accounting policy and note goodwill spectrum license and other intangible asset of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii

single multiple element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time upon qualifying jump program upgrade the customer remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase new device from on new eip for customer who enroll in jump we establish liability through the reduction of revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumption which requires judgment including estimating the customer remaining eip balance at trade in the expected fair value of the used device at trade in and the probability and timing of trade in when customer upgrade their device the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liability all assumption are reviewed periodically rent expensemost of the lease on our tower site have fixed rent escalation which provide for periodic increase in the amount of rent payable over time we calculate straight line rent expense for each of these lease based on the fixed non cancellable term of the lease plus all period if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes penalty on in such amount that renewal appears at lease inception or significant modification to be reasonably assured we consider several factor in assessing whether renewal period are reasonably assured of being exercised including the continued maturation of our network nationwide technological advance within the telecommunication industry and the availability of alternative site we make of contentssignificant assumption at lease inception in determining and assessing the factor that constitute penalty in doing so we primarily consider cost incurred in acquiring and developing new site the useful life of site improvement and equipment cost future economic condition and the extent to which improvement in wireless technology can be incorporated into current assessment of whether an economic compulsion will exist in the future to renew lease income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on temporary difference between the financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when these difference are realized valuation allowance is maintained against deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we consider many factor when determining whether valuation allowance is needed including recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectation of future income the carryforward period available for tax reporting purpose and other relevant factor we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we ass whether it is more likely than not that tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merit of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefit in light of change in fact and circumstance such change in tax

loss and unamortized discount receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value at the time of an installment sale we impute discount for interest there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables and record the eip receivables at their present value which is determined by discounting future payment at the imputed interest rate the difference between the present value of the eip receivables and their face amount result in discount which is recorded direct reduction to the carrying value with corresponding reduction to equipment of contentsrevenues in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables result we do not recognize separate valuation allowance at the time of issuance the effect of uncertainty about future cash flow are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized other revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount we ass the need for and if necessary recognize an allowance for credit loss to the extent the amount of estimated probable loss on the gross eip receivable balance exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balance the current portion of the eip receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables net and the long term portion of the eip receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables due after one year net in our consolidated balance sheet we have an arrangement to sell certain eip

attribute portion of the allowance to our respective account receivable and eip portfolio segment the entire allowance is available to absorb credit loss inherent in the total receivables portfolio our process involves procedure to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristic of our account receivable and eip receivable portfolio segment for each portfolio segment loss are estimated collectively for group of receivables with similar characteristic our allowance level are influenced by receivable volume receivable delinquency status historical loss experience and other condition influencing loss expectation such macro economic condition inventoriesinventories consist primarily of wireless device and accessory which are valued at the lower of cost or market cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost shipping and handling cost paid to wireless device and accessory vendor and cost to refurbish used device recovered through our device upgrade

experience long lived assetslong lived asset include asset that do not have indefinite life such property and equipment and other intangible asset we ass potential impairment to our long lived asset when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if any indicator of impairment are present we test recoverability the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted cash flow do not exceed the asset or asset group carrying amount then an impairment loss is recorded measured the amount by which the carrying amount of long lived asset or asset group

to the wireless network property and equipment are recorded at cost le accumulated depreciation and impairment if any in property and equipment net on our consolidated balance sheet we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit depreciable life study are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of useful life for certain category of property and equipment these study take into account actual usage physical wear and tear replacement history and assumption about technology evolution when these factor indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining of contentsestimated useful life leasehold improvement are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the related lease term we introduced jump on demand which allows customer to lease device over period of up to month and upgrade it for new device up to one time per month to date all of our leased device were classified operating lease at operating lease inception leased wireless device are transferred from inventory to property and equipment leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to which is generally shorter than the lease

capitalization commences with pre construction period administrative and technical activity which includes obtaining lease zoning approval and building permit and cease at the point at which the asset is ready for it intended use we capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment capitalized interest is reported reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related asset future obligation related to capital lease are included in short term debt and long term debt in our consolidated balance sheet depreciation of asset held under capital lease is included in depreciation and amortization expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income we record an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived asset and corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred in period subsequent to initial measurement we recognize change in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revision to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate over time the liability is accreted to it present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset our obligation relate primarily to certain legal obligation to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative asset are located we capitalize certain cost incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software capitalization of software cost commences once the final selection of the specific software solution ha been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project capitalized

preliminary project stage well maintenance and training cost are expensed incurred other intangible assetsintangible asset that do not have indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life customer list are amortized using the sum of the year digit method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flow the remaining finite lived intangible asset are amortized using the straight line method goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assetsgoodwillgoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net asset acquired in business combination spectrum licensesspectrum license are carried at cost incurred to acquire the spectrum license and the cost to prepare the spectrum license for their intended use such cost to clear acquired spectrum license the federal communication commission fcc issue spectrum license which provide with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service area to provide wireless communication service while spectrum license are issued for fixed period of time typically for up to fifteen year the fcc ha granted license renewal routinely and at nominal cost the spectrum license held by expire at various date we believe we will be able to meet all requirement necessary to secure of contentsrenewal of our spectrum license at nominal cost moreover we determined there are currently no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor that limit the useful life of our spectrum license therefore we determined the spectrum license should be treated indefinite lived intangible asset at time we enter into agreement to sell or exchange spectrum license upon entering into the arrangement if the transaction ha been deemed to have commercial substance spectrum license are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value net of any impairment to asset held for sale included in other current asset in our consolidated balance sheet until approval and completion of the exchange or sale upon closing of the transaction spectrum license acquired part of an exchange of nonmonetary asset are valued at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum license obtained book value of the spectrum license transferred and cash paid if any is recognized gain and included in gain on disposal of spectrum license in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income our fair value estimate of spectrum license are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data if the transaction lack commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable the acquired spectrum license are recorded at the book value of the asset transferred or exchanged impairmentwe ass the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate such asset might be impaired when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment for reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the single reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we test our spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology which is an income approach to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition guarantee liabilitieswe offer device trade in program just upgrade my phone jump which provides eligible customer specified price trade in right to upgrade their device upon enrollment participating customer must finance the purchase of device on an eip and have qualifying mobile monthly wireless service plan which is treated single multiple element arrangement when entered into at or near the same time upon qualifying jump program upgrade the customer remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase new device from on new eip for customer who enroll in jump we recognize liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumption which requires judgment including estimating the customer remaining eip balance at trade in the expected fair value of the used device at trade in and the probability and timing of trade in we ass our guarantee liability at each reporting date to determine if fact and circumstance would indicate the incurrence of an incremental contingent liability is probable and if so reasonably estimable the recognition and subsequent adjustment of the contingent guarantee liability result of these assessment are recorded adjustment to revenue when customer upgrade their device the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liability of contentsfair value measurementswe carry certain asset and liability at fair value fair value is defined an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the three tier hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value which prioritizes the input based on the observability of the measurement date is follows level price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than the quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability andlevel input for which there is little or no market data which require to develop assumption of market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of asset and liability being measured within the fair value hierarchy the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent short term investment account receivable account receivable from affiliate and account payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturity of these instrument the carrying value of eip receivables approximate fair value the receivables are recorded at their present value net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit loss there were no financial instrument with carrying value materially different from their fair value based on quoted market price or rate for the same or similar instrument or internal valuation model derivative financial instrumentsderivative financial instrument primarily relate to embedded derivative for certain component of the reset feature of the senior reset note to affiliate which are required to be bifurcated and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value change in fair value are recognized in interest expense to affiliate in our consolidated statement

and selling or leasing device and accessory we offer our wireless service and device to customer which may be comprised of multiple contract entered into with customer at or near the same time in recognizing revenue we ass such agreement single bundled arrangement that may involve multiple deliverable which include wireless service wireless device or combination thereof and allocate revenue between each deliverable based on the relative selling price of each deliverable on standalone basis wireless service revenuewe generate our wireless service revenue from providing access to and usage of our wireless communication network service revenue also include revenue earned for providing value added service to customer such handset insurance service service revenue are billed either in

customer are recorded reduction to revenue we recognize service revenue for data stash plan when such service are delivered and the data is consumed or at time of forfeiture or expiration revenue relating to unused data that is carried over to the following month are deferred and valued based on their relative standalone selling price revenue is recorded gross for arrangement involving the resale of third party service where we are considered the primary obligor and is recorded net of associated cost incurred for service whereby we are not considered the primary obligor federal universal service fund usf and other fee are assessed by various governmental authority in connection with the service we provide to our customer when we separately bill and collect these regulatory

expected device return based on historical experience we offer certain customer the option to pay for device and accessory in installment using an eip equipment sale not reasonably assured to be collectible are recorded on cash basis payment are received in addition for customer enrolled in jump we separate the jump trade in right from the multiple element arrangement at it fair value and defer the portion of revenue which represents the fair value of the trade in right see guarantee liability section above for further information we introduced jump on demand which allows customer to lease device and upgrade their leased wireless device for new device up to one time per month leased wireless device are accounted for operating lease and lease revenue are recognized earned on straight line basis over the lease term the residual value of purchased leased device is recorded equipment revenue and cost of equipment sale see property and equipment section above for further information rent expensewe have operating lease for cell site retail location corporate office and dedicated transportation line some of which have escalating rental during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal period we recognize rent expense on straight line basis over the non cancelable lease term and renewal period that are considered reasonably assured at the inception of the lease we consider several factor in assessing whether renewal period are reasonably assured of being exercised including the continued maturation of our network nationwide technological advance within the telecommunication industry and the availability of alternative site advertising expensewe expense the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditure to market our service and product incurred for the year ended december and advertising expense included in selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income were billion billion and billion respectively income taxesdeferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on temporary difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when these difference are realized valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we ass whether it is more likely than not that tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merit of the position and

activity without additional subordinated financial support from other party have equity investor which do not have the ability to make significant decision relating to the entity operation through voting right do not have the obligation to absorb the expected loss or do not have the right to receive the residual return of the entity the most common type of vie is special purpose entity spe spes are commonly used in securitization transaction in order to isolate certain asset and distribute the cash flow from those asset to investor spes are generally structured to insulate investor from claim on the spe asset by creditor of other entity including the creditor of the seller of the asset the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the asset and liability of the vie the primary

effective interest method and wa previously presented within interest income in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income is now presented within other revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income we believe this presentation is preferable because it provides better representation of amount earned from our major ongoing operation and aligns with industry practice thereby enhancing comparability we have applied this change retrospectively and presented the effect on the year ended december and in the table below year ended december in million unadjusted change in accounting principle adjustedother revenue other expense net net of content year ended december in million filed change in accounting principle adjustedother revenue other expense net net year ended december in million filed change in accounting principle adjustedother revenue other expense net net change in accounting principle did not have an impact on basic or diluted earnings per share for the year ended december and or accumulated deficit of december and accounting pronouncement adopted during the current yearin january the fasb issued asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the amendment in this update eliminate the requirement to perform step two of the goodwill impairment test which requires hypothetical purchase price allocation consistent with the principle in determining fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination when an impairment is determined to have occurred instead if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited by the amount of goodwill in that reporting unit we adopted this new guidance in the fourth quarter of the implementation of this standard did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statement accounting pronouncement not yet adoptedin may the fasb issued asu revenue from contract with customer topic asu and ha since modified the standard with several asus the standard is effective for and we adopted the standard on january the standard requires entity to recognize revenue through the application of five step model which includes identification of the contract identification of the performance obligation determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation and recognition of revenue the entity satisfies the performance obligation the guidance permit two method of adoption the full retrospective method applying the standard to each prior reporting period presented or the modified retrospective method with cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application the standard also allows entity to apply certain practical expedient at their discretion we will adopt the standard using the modified retrospective method with cumulative catch up adjustment and will provide additional disclosure comparing result to previous gaap in our consolidated financial statement we plan to apply the new revenue standard only to contract not completed of the date of initial application referred to open contract the most significant judgment and impact upon adoption of the standard include the following item upon adoption we will defer capitalize incremental contract acquisition cost and recognize amortize them over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contract to which the cost relate deferred contract cost have an average amortization period of approximately month subject to being monitored every period to reflect any significant change in assumption in addition the deferred contract cost asset is assessed for impairment on of contentsperiodic basis we are utilizing the practical expedient permitting expensing of cost to obtain contract when the expected amortization period is one year or le which typically result in expensing commission paid to acquire branded prepaid service contract result incremental contract acquisition cost paid on open contract of approximately million are expected to be capitalized and subsequently amortized upon adoption on january cumulative effect adjustment to equity which consists primarily of commission paid to acquire branded postpaid service contract contract cost capitalized for new contract will accumulate during deferred asset result we expect there to be net benefit to operating income during capitalized cost amortize into expense over time the accretive benefit to operating income anticipated in is expected to moderate in and become insignificant in the timing benefit of deferring these cost dissipate under the new standard certain commission paid to dealer previously recognized reduction to revenue will be recorded commission cost in selling general and administrative expense during such commission cost were approximately million promotional bill credit offered to customer on equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract result in an extended service contract term with multiple performance obligation which impact the allocation and timing of revenue recognition between service revenue and equipment revenue contract asset will be recorded when control of the equipment transfer to the customer and subsequently recognized reduction to service revenue over the extended contract term contract asset of approximately million are expected to be capitalized upon adoption on january cumulative effect adjustment we are recognizing the financing component in our eip contract including those financing component that are not considered to be significant to the contract this application is consistent with our current practice of imputing interest we have implemented significant new revenue accounting system process and internal control over revenue recognition to assist in the application of the new standard the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard on january is estimated to be decrease to accumulated deficit of approximately million in february the fasb issued asu lease topic the standard requires all lessee to report right of use asset and lease liability for most lease the income statement recognition is similar to existing lease accounting and is based on lease classification the standard requires lessee and lessor to classify most lease using principle similar to existing lease accounting for lessor the standard modifies the classification criterion and the accounting for sale type and direct financing lease we are currently evaluating the standard which will require recognizing and measuring lease at the beginning of the earliest period presented using modified retrospective approach our evaluation includes assessing which of our arrangement qualify lease and aggregating lease data and related information well determining whether previous conclusion for certain transaction such failed sale leaseback arrangement under topic would change under topic we plan to adopt the standard when it becomes effective for beginning january and expect the adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of right of use asset and lease liability that have not previously been recorded which will have material impact on our consolidated financial statement we are in the process of implementing significant new lease accounting system process and internal control over lease recognition which will ultimately assist in the application of the new standard in june the fasb issued asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument the standard
