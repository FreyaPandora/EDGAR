thing safety efficacy reliability availability patient convenience delivery device price reimbursement access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration certain of the existing patent on our principal product have expired and we face new and increasing competition including from biosimilars we may also compete biosimilar or generic version of our competitor product biosimilar is another version of biological product for which marketing approval is sought or ha been obtained based on demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product see government regulation we expect the adverse impact from biosimilars to be more like branded biologics than generic small molecule although we expect biosimilars to compete on price we believe many patient provider and payer will continue to place high value on the reputation reliability and safety of our product zarxio biosimilar version of neupogen from sandoz novartis company sandoz which launched in the united state in wa the first biosimilar entrant into the market company have pending application with the fda for biosimilar version of epogen and neulasta along with additional biosimilar version of neupogen we are well positioned to compete and will leverage the experience we have in the united state versus branded competition well our considerable experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in europe the introduction of new product the development of new process or technology by competitor or the emergence of new information about existing product may result in increased competition for our marketed product even for those protected by patent or in reduction in the price we receive from selling our product in addition the development of new treatment option or standard of care may reduce the use of our product or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trial for our product candidate used in this document clinical

united state expiration of the sensipar patent wholly owned subsidiary of takeda pharmaceutical company limited kyprolis is facing increased competition from several recently approved product of our principal product are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer in many market around the world these payer including government health system private health insurer and other organization continue to be focused on reducing the cost of healthcare their effort have intensified result of rising healthcare cost and economic challenge drug and in particular specialty drug such our product remain focus for cost containment by these party result payer around the world are being more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical product requiring higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such product bring to patient and the broader healthcare system the scrutiny of biopharmaceutical pricing in the united state remains intense and point of focus in the discussion of rising healthcare cost the pricing practice of certain company have increased public medium and government scrutiny of the biopharmaceutical industry providing greater incentive for government and private payer to limit or regulate the price of drug product and service at the same time value assessment of new technology previously used predominantly outside the united state are an impact in the healthcare environment healthcare provider organization and independent organization are creating their own value assessment of biopharmaceutical drug for comparison with manufacturer pricing although these organization do not set drug price seek to influence pricing well payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessment often making assertion around they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for product these development put greater pressure on access to pricing of and sale of our product in the united state healthcare provider are reimbursed for covered service and product they deliver through medicare medicaid and other government healthcare program well through private payer pharmacy are also reimbursed in similar manner for drug product they dispense we are required to provide specified rebate or discount on the product we sell to certain government funded program including medicare and medicaid and those rebate or discount have increased time the patient protection and affordable care act aca enacted in increased many of the mandatory discount and rebate required of and imposed new branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturer and importer fee payable each year by and other manufacturer the new presidential administration ha identified repealing and replacing the aca priority the timing and method of repeal and replacement legislation is uncertain but change could include the number of patient life covered the quality of the insurance medicaid eligibility and the level of patient protection provided further effort by government agency and state legislature in the united state could also affect and our industry for example recently enacted vermont law requires manufacturer to submit price increase justification to the state attorney general if certain price increase and state spending threshold are met example of other proposal that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiative that would place maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical product purchased by state agency and state legislative effort to cap pharmaceutical price for commercial payer other legislative and regulatory action that would have significant impact on amgen include change to the medicare program cover and reimburses current and future drug including for patient with end stage renal disease change in the federal payment rate or new rebate requirement for covered drug and policy for payment in medicare or medicaid and change to coverage and payment for biosimilars including the current medicare biosimilar coverage and payment policy intended to encourage biosimilar adoption or other policy that provide easier substitution or reimbursement advantage in the private sector healthcare provider and payer continue to institute cost reduction and containment measure that lower drug spending altogether or shift greater portion of the cost to patient such measure include more limited benefit plan design higher tier formulary placement that increase the level of patient out of pocket cost and stricter utilization criterion patient may get access to drug in the retail pharmacy sector in which the majority of our sale for enbrel sensipar and repatha occur the use of such measure by pharmacy benefit manager pbms and insurer ha continued to intensify which have limited amgen product usage and revenue pbms are third party organization tasked with administrating prescription drug program for large employer health plan and government program consolidation ha resulted in smaller number of pbms and insurer overseeing large portion of total covered life in the united state for example three pbms oversee approximately of covered life in the united state result pbms and insurer have greater market power and negotiating leverage to exclude drug from their formulary in favor of competitor drug or alternative treatment and or to mandate stricter utilization criterion formulary exclusion effectively encourages patient and provider to seek alternative treatment or pay of the cost of drug recent experience with repatha underscore that utilization management requirement continue to be onerous for patient and physician limiting access to appropriate usage in highly competitive treatment market such with enbrel pbms are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebate from manufacturer in order to maintain their formulary position drug favorable position on formulary is essential to ensure patient have access in general in country outside the united state government sponsored healthcare system are the primary payer for drug and biologics with increased budgetary constraint payer in many country apply variety of measure to exert downward price pressure these measure can include mandatory price control price referencing therapeutic reference pricing increase in mandate or incentive for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government mandated price cut we expect that will continue to take aggressive action to reduce expenditure on drug and biologics similarly fiscal constraint may also impact the extent to which country are willing to approve new and innovative therapy and or allow access to new technology for example many health technology assessment hta organization use formal economic metric such cost effectiveness to determine coverage and reimbursement of new therapy and these organization are proliferating in established and emerging market the dynamic and development discussed serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our product and the industry whole we remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatment for unmet medical need amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to enable patient access to needed medicine we do this by investing billion of dollar annually in research and development developing more affordable therapeutic choice in the form of high quality and reliably supplied biosimilars pricing our medicine to reflect the value they provide partnering with payer to share risk and accountability for health outcome providing patient support and education program and helping patient in financial need access our medicine and working with policymakers patient and other stakeholder to establish sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and patient and their healthcare professional are the primary decision maker see item risk factor our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability and item risk factor guideline and recommendation published by various organization can reduce the use of our product manufacturing distribution and raw materialsmanufacturingwe believe we are leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capability represent competitive advantage the product we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drug the majority of our product are biologics that are produced in living cell and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variation highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale process into reproducible commercial manufacturing process for additional information regarding manufacturing facility see item property we perform of our bulk manufacturing formulation and or fill and finish activity in our puerto rico rhode island california and ireland facility and also conduct finish activity in the netherlands in addition we utilize third party contract manufacturer to supplement our commercial manufacturing requirement we manufacture product to support our clinical trial primarily in our california and rhode island location we also utilize third party contract manufacturer for certain clinical product see item risk factor for discussion of the factor that could adversely impact our manufacturing operation and the global supply of our product distributionwe operate distribution center in kentucky california and the netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical product we also use third party distributor to supplement distribution of our product worldwide otherin addition to the manufacturing and distribution activity noted above our operation in the united state the territory of puerto rico and the netherlands include key manufacturing support function including quality control process development procurement production scheduling and warehousing certain of those manufacturing and distribution activity are highly regulated by the fda well other international regulatory agency see government regulation regulation in the united state regulation of manufacturing standard initiativeswe have multiple ongoing initiative that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and or mitigating manufacturing risk while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our product we have initiated the bulk process qualification campaign to facilitate licensure at our biologics manufacturing facility in singapore upon licensure this facility will expand our capability to manufacture cell culture product utilizing new technology and innovation the facility will be fully reconfigurable providing efficient manufacturing capability to help ensure supply of our product worldwide our first product to be manufactured in the facility will be denosumab we are also constructing an additional new facility at the site in singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kyprolis in addition to these initiative we have project designed to optimize manufacturing asset utilization to continue our use of third party contract manufacturer and to maintain state of regulatory compliance this includes manufacturing network consolidation initiative well process improvement surrounding manufacturing see item risk factor manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale raw material and medical devicescertain raw material medical device including companion diagnostics and component necessary for the commercial and or clinical manufacturing of our product are provided by and are the proprietary product of unaffiliated third party supplier certain of which may be our only source for such material we currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such supplier by inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative source when feasible we also monitor the financial condition of certain supplier and their ability to supply our need see item risk factor we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component we perform various procedure to assist in authenticating the source of raw material including intermediary material used in the manufacture of our product which include verification of the country of origin the procedure are incorporated into the manufacturing process we and our third party contract manufacturer perform government regulationregulation by government authority in the united state and other country is significant factor in the production and marketing of our product and our ongoing activity in order to clinically test manufacture and market product for therapeutic use we must satisfy mandatory procedure and safety and effectiveness standard established by various regulatory body compliance with these standard is complex and failure to comply with any of these standard can result in significant implication see item risk factor for discussion of factor that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial product including global regulatory implication regulation in the united statesin the united state the public health service act the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and the regulation promulgated thereunder well other federal and state statute and regulation govern among other thing the production research development testing manufacture quality control labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion and distribution of our product well the reporting of certain payment and other transfer of value to healthcare professional and teaching hospital clinical development and product approval drug development in our industry is complex challenging and risky and failure rate are high product development cycle are typically long approximately to year from discovery to market potential new medicine must undergo many year of preclinical and clinical testing to establish it safety and efficacy for use in human at appropriate dosing level and with an acceptable risk benefit profile after laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animal we file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda to begin human testing typically we undertake an fda designated three phase human clinical testing program in phase we conduct small clinical trial to investigate the safety and proper dose range of our product candidate in small number of human subject in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate side effect profile and the efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study the fda monitor the progress of each trial conducted under an ind and may at it discretion evaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the fda risk benefit assessment with regard to the enrolled in the trial the result of preclinical and clinical trial are submitted to the fda in the form of bla for biologic product or an nda for small molecule product we are not permitted to market or promote new product until the fda ha approved our marketing application approval of biosimilars the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway the pathway allows sponsor of biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the non clinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar ha been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful difference in term of safety purity and potency the relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many case biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trial typically required of originator risk benefit ha previously been established in order to preserve incentive for future innovation the law establishes period of exclusivity for originator product which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining fda approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator data in their application to the fda for year after fda approval of the originator product the law not change the duration of patent granted on biologic product the fda ha released number of guidance document part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars of which remain in draft form of the

providing approval to market product if after receiving approval from the fda we make material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required we also must adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulation and product specific regulation enforced by the fda through it facility inspection program the fda conduct regular periodic visit to re inspect our equipment facility laboratory and process following an initial approval regulation of combination product combination product are defined by the fda to include product composed of two or more regulated component biologic and or drug and device biologics drug and device each have their own regulatory requirement and combination product may have additional requirement number of our marketed product meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that number of our pipeline product candidate will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework well regulation outside the united statesin the european union eu country well switzerland canada australia and japan regulatory requirement and approval process are similar in principle to those in the united state in the eu there are currently two potential track for seeking marketing approval for product which is not authorized in any member state decentralized procedure and centralized procedure in the decentralized procedure identical application for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agency regulatory review is led by one member state the reference member state and it assessment based on safety quality and efficacy is reviewed and approved assuming there are no concern that the product pose serious risk to public health by the other member state from which the applicant is seeking approval the concerned member state the decentralized procedure lead to series of single national approval in all relevant country in the centralized procedure which is required of all product derived from biotechnology company submits single maa to the ema which conduct an evaluation of the dossier drawing upon it scientific resource across europe if the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirement for quality safety and efficacy the ema chmp adopts positive opinion which is transmitted to the ec for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization while the ec generally follows the chmp opinion it is not bound to do subsequent commercialization is enabled by country by country reimbursement approval the eu biosimilars are approved under specialized pathway of the centralized procedure with the pathway applicant seek and obtain regulatory approval for biosimilar the data exclusivity period for the original reference product ha expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in term of quality safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the european economic area other country such russia turkey and those in latin america and the middle east have review process and data requirement similar to those of the eu and in some case rely on prior marketing approval from or eu regulatory authority the regulatory process in these country may include manufacturing testing facility inspection testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirement in asia pacific number of country such china japan south korea and taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purpose part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trial which can add to overall drug development and registration timeline in most of the asian market registration timeline depend on marketing approval in the united state or the eu in some market in asia such china thailand and indonesia the regulatory timeline can be le predictable the regulatory process may also include manufacturing testing facility inspection testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirement country such australia and japan have more mature system that would allow for submission in more competitive timeframes regarding biosimilars several of these country have pathway to register biosimilars south korea india australia singapore and taiwan and biosimilar product are already present on the market australia and south korea in some country such japan and those in the eu medical device may be subject to regulatory regime whereby the manufacturer must establish that it medical device conforms to essential requirement set out in the law for the particular device category for example in the eu with limited exception medical device placed on the market must bear the conformité européenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirement post approval phaseafter approval we continue to monitor adverse event reported following the use of our product through post marketing routine pharmacovigilance surveillance and study when applicable we report such event to the appropriate regulatory agency required per local regulation for individual case and aggregate report we proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practice and ensure implementation of signal detection assessment and the communication of adverse event that may be associated with the use of our product we may also be required by regulatory agency to conduct further clinical trial on our marketed product condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy health authority including the fda have authority to mandate labeling change to product at any point in product lifecycle based on new safety information or part of an evolving label change to particular class of product health authority including the fda also have the authority before or after approval to require company to implement risk management program for product to ensure that the benefit of the drug outweigh the risk each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factor required in the united state risk management program is known risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rem and we currently have rem for prolia nplate and blincyto well for our erythropoiesis stimulating agent esas which includes epogen and aranesp other regulationwe are also subject to various law pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse including anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law

under the false claim law may also arise when violation of certain law or regulation related to the underlying product violation regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payment contributes to the submission of false claim in amgen announced it had finalized settlement agreement with the government and various other party regarding allegation that amgen promotional contracting sale and marketing activity and arrangement caused the submission of various false claim under the federal civil false claim act and various state false claim act in connection with entering into the settlement agreement amgen also entered into corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human service that requires amgen to maintain it corporate compliance program and to undertake set of defined corporate integrity obligation for period of five year due to the breadth of the provision and the absence of guidance in the form of regulation or court decision addressing some of our practice it is possible that in the future our practice might be further challenged under anti kickback or similar law additionally the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa prohibits corporation and their representative from offering promising authorizing or making payment to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa includes interaction with certain healthcare professional in many country other country have enacted similar anti corruption law and or regulation our business ha been and will continue to be subject to various other and foreign law rule and or regulation research and development and selected product candidateswe focus our on novel human therapeutic for the treatment of serious illness in the area of oncology hematology cardiovascular disease inflammation bone health nephrology and neuroscience we take modality independent approach to with focus on biologics we use cutting edge science and technology to study the subtle biological mechanism in search of therapy that will improve the life of those who suffer from disease our discovery research program may therefore yield target that lead to the development of human therapeutic delivered large molecule small molecule or other combination or new modality human genetic validation is used whenever possible to enhance the likelihood of success for the year ended december and our expense were billion billion and billion respectively we have major center in several location throughout the united state including thousand oak and san francisco california and cambridge massachusetts in iceland and in the united kingdom well smaller research center and development facility globally see item property we conduct clinical trial activity by using both our internal staff and third party contract clinical trial service provider to increase the number of patient available for enrollment in our clinical trial we have opened clinical site and will continue opening clinical site and enrolling patient in number of geographic location see government regulation clinical development and product approval for discussion of government regulation over clinical development also see item risk factor we must conduct clinical trial in human before we can commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication some of our competitor are actively engaged in in area where we have product or where we are developing product candidate or new indication for existing product for example we compete with other clinical trial for eligible patient which may limit the number of available patient who meet the criterion for certain clinical trial the competitive marketplace for our product candidate is significantly dependent on the timing of entry into the market early entry may have important advantage in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to product eventual success and profitability accordingly we expect that in some case the relative speed with which we can develop product complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantity of product to the market will be important to our competitive position in addition to product candidate and marketed product generated from our internal effort we acquire company acquire and license certain product and technology right and establish arrangement with third party to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our capability product pipeline and marketed product base in pursuing these arrangement and licensing or acquisition activity

factorsthis report and other document we file with the sec contain forward looking statement that are based on current expectation estimate forecast and projection about our future performance our business our belief and our management assumption the statement are not guarantee of future performance and involve certain risk uncertainty and assumption that are difficult to predict should carefully consider the risk and uncertainty our business face the risk described below are not the only one we face our business is also subject to the risk that affect many other company such employment relation general economic condition geopolitical event and international operation further additional risk not currently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operation liquidity and stock price sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability sale of our product depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer including government healthcare program and private insurance plan government and private payer continue to pursue aggressive initiative to contain cost and manage drug utilization and are increasingly focused on the effectiveness benefit and cost of similar treatment which could result in lower reimbursement rate for our product or narrower population for our product will be reimbursed by payer public scrutiny of the price of drug and other healthcare cost is increasing and greater focus on pricing and price increase may limit our ability to set or increase the price of our product based on their value which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation substantial portion of our business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare program and private insurance plan regulated by the federal government see item business reimbursement change to federal reimbursement policy may come through legislative action president donald trump and other lawmaker have made statement about potentially repealing and or replacing the aca although specific legislation for such repeal or replacement ha not yet been introduced while we are unable to predict what change may ultimately be enacted to the extent that future change affect how our product are paid for and reimbursed by government and private payer our business could be adversely impacted for example discussion continue about proposal that would allow the federal government to directly negotiate drug price with pharmaceutical manufacturer or require manufacturer to pay higher rebate in the medicare part setting change in federal reimbursement policy may also arise result of regulation or demonstration project implemented by the center for medicare medicaid service cm the federal agency responsible for administering medicare medicaid and the health insurance marketplace cm ha substantial power to quickly implement policy change that can significantly affect how our product are covered and reimbursed state government action or ballot initiative can also affect how our product are covered and reimbursed or create additional pressure on how our product are priced many state have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing legislation including state proposal designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturer to publicly report proprietary pricing information or to place maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical product purchased by state agency for example ohio voter are expected to consider in their november election ballot proposition that would prohibit the state from paying greater price for drug than the lowest price paid by the department of veteran affair passage of this proposition could lead to the introduction of additional ballot initiative in other state legislative or regulatory change or other government initiative that decrease the coverage or reimbursement available for our product require that we pay increased rebate limit our ability to offer co pay payment assistance to commercial patient or limit the pricing of pharmaceutical product could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation payer including healthcare insurer pbms and group purchasing organization increasingly seek price discount or rebate in connection with the placement of our product on their formulary or those they manage consolidation in the health insurance industry ha resulted in large insurer and pbms exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiation with drug manufacturer significantly increasing such discount and rebate and limiting patient access and usage three pbms currently oversee approximately of total covered life in the united state payer continue to adopt benefit plan change that shift greater portion of prescription cost to patient and some payer may attempt to limit the use of program assisting commercial patient with their co payment payer also control cost by imposing restriction on access to our product such by requiring prior authorization or step therapy and may choose to exclude certain indication for which our product are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely for example since the launch of repatha in august the application of utilization management criterion by some payer including pbms ha resulted in denial of coverage for significant number of patient for whom repatha ha been prescribed slowing repatha sale in early february we announced that our phase outcome study evaluating the ability of repatha to prevent cardiovascular event met it primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint see item business significant development however in the current competitive environment the application of restrictive utilization management criterion by some payer may continue until the clinical data is reflected in approved product labeling or even thereafter ultimately further discount rebate coverage or plan change restriction or exclusion described above could have material adverse effect on sale of our affected product we also face risk relating to the reporting of pricing data that affect the reimbursement of and discount provided for our product to government healthcare program pricing data that we submit impact the payment rate for provider rebate we pay and discount we are required to provide under medicare medicaid and other government drug program government price reporting regulation are complex and may require manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data our price reporting data calculation are reviewed monthly and quarterly and based on such review we have on occasion restated previously reported pricing data to reflect change in calculation methodology reasonable assumption and or underlying data if our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fine and penalty or other government enforcement action which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebate and provide additional discount the united state we expect country will continue to take aggressive action to reduce their healthcare expenditure see item business reimbursement for example international reference pricing irp is widely used by large number of country to control cost based on an external benchmark of product price in other country irp policy can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect difference in the burden of disease indication market structure or affordability difference across country or region any deterioration in the coverage and reimbursement available for our product or in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payer to physician and other provider could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare provider to prescribe our product for their patient or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our product or the price we receive for them such change could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation our product face substantial competition we operate in highly competitive environment see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product competition we expect that our product will compete with new drug currently in development drug currently approved for other indication that may later be approved for the same indication those of our product and drug approved for other indication that are used label large pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer of pharmaceutical product are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer have formed partnership to pursue biosimilars in addition some of our competitor may have technical competitive or other advantage over for the development of technology and process or greater experience in particular therapeutic area and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can enhance such advantage these advantage may make it difficult for to compete with them to successfully discover develop and market new product and for our current product to compete with new product or new product indication they may bring to market result our product may compete against product that have lower price equivalent or superior performance better safety profile easier administration earlier market availability or other competitive feature if we are unable to compete effectively this could reduce sale which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future we currently face competition from biosimilars in both europe and the united state and we expect to face increasing biosimilar competition in the next year and beyond expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent right could accelerate such competition and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and or scope of our patent our product may also experience greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generic that come to market when branded product that compete with our product lose their own patent protection to the extent that government adopt more permissive approval framework and competitor are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars the rate of increased competition for our product could accelerate in the eu biosimilars are evaluated and authorized pursuant to set of general and product class specific guideline in addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and or increase potential healthcare saving some eu country have adopted or are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measure such requiring physician prescribing quota or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference product and other country may adopt similar measure some eu country may impose automatic price reduction upon market entry of the second or third biosimilar competitor in the united state the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway see item business government regulation regulation in the united state approval of biosimilars the first biosimilar entrant into the market sandoz zarxio is biosimilar version of neupogen and wa launched in the united state in since then the fda ha approved additional biosimilars including biosimilar version of enbrel in addition growing number of company have announced that they are in varying stage of development of biosimilar version of existing biotechnology product including biosimilars that would compete with our product company pursuing development of biosimilar version of our product have challenged and may continue to challenge our patent well in advance of the expiration of our material patent for information related to our biosimilars patent litigation including our litigation regarding enbrel see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement see also our intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation the pathway includes the option for biosimilar product that meet certain criterion to be approved interchangeable with their reference product some company currently developing biosimilars may seek to register their product interchangeable biologics which could make it easier for pharmacist to substitute those biosimilars for our product or could encourage prescribers who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative product in addition critic of the year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and or to encourage the fda to interpret narrowly the law provision regarding which new product receive data exclusivity which could expose to biosimilar competition at an earlier time while we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars on our product we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the united state and europe in the next year and beyond result of biosimilars and downward pressure on our product price and sale this biosimilar competition ha had and could increasingly have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authority in the united state including the fda and by foreign regulatory authority including the ema we are required in the united state and in foreign country to obtain approval from regulatory authority before we manufacture market and sell our product once our product are approved the fda and other and foreign regulatory agency have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting perform inspection change product labeling or mandate withdrawal of our product failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirement may subject to administrative and or judicially imposed sanction or monetary penalty well reputational and other harm the sanction could include the fda or foreign regulatory authority refusal to approve pending application delay in obtaining or withdrawal of approval delay or suspension of clinical trial warning letter product recall or seizure total or partial suspension of our operation injunction fine civil penalty and or criminal prosecution obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval have been and will continue to be increasingly difficult time consuming and costly legislative body or regulatory agency could enact new law or regulation change existing law or regulation or change their interpretation of law or regulation at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our product or product candidate the rate and degree of change in existing law and regulation and regulatory expectation have accelerated in established market and regulatory expectation continue to evolve in emerging market we are unable to predict whether and when any further change to law or regulatory policy affecting our business could occur such change to regulation governing manufacturer communication concerning drug product and drug product candidate and whether such change could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation regulatory authority may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoint we select for our clinical trial number of our product and product candidate have been evaluated in clinical trial using surrogate endpoint that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint for example therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for it ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that patient life without the disease worsening pfs demonstrating that the product candidate produce statistically significant improvement in pfs doe not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patient remain alive in the cardiovascular setting heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for it ability to reduce ldl level elevated ldl level ha been surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular event such death heart attack and stroke the use of surrogate endpoint such pfs and ldl reduction in the absence of other measure of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such result are statistically significant regulatory authority could also add new requirement such the completion of enrollment in confirmatory study or the completion of an outcome study or meaningful portion of an outcome study condition for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication for example our initial fda application for repatha sought approval for broader patient population based on data demonstrating that repatha reduced ldl level however the fda ultimately approved repatha only for subset of those patient citing among other thing the absence of positive outcome data showing that repatha prevents cardiovascular event we subsequently announced that our phase outcome study evaluating the ability of repatha to prevent cardiovascular event met it primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint see item business significant development however we can not predict the degree to which the result of this study will be incorporated into the repatha label by regulator there may also be situation in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to comparative product can be shown the imposition of additional requirement or our inability to meet them in timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing effort delay or prevent from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidate or new indication for existing product or prevent from maintaining our current label some of our product have been approved by and foreign regulatory authority on conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirement of regulator for example in december we received accelerated approval for blincyto for the treatment of patient with ph relapsed or refractory cell precursor all in the united state with continued approval contingent upon clinical benefit in subsequent trial blincyto also received conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of patient with ph relapsed or refractory cell precursor all from the ec in november regulatory authority are placing greater focus on monitoring product originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsor of such product have met the condition of the accelerated or conditional approval if we are unable to fulfill the regulator requirement that were condition of product accelerated or conditional approval and or if regulator re evaluate the data or risk benefit profile of our product the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed alternatively we may be required to change the product labeled indication or even withdraw the product from the market safety problem or signal can arise our product and product candidate are evaluated in clinical trial including investigator sponsored study or our marketed product are used in clinical practice we are required to continuously collect and ass adverse event reported to and to communicate to regulatory agency these adverse event and safety signal regarding product regulatory agency periodically perform inspection of our pharmacovigilance process including our adverse event reporting in pharmacovigilance legislation became effective in the eu that enhanced the authority of european regulator to require company to conduct additional post approval clinical efficacy and safety study and increased the requirement on sponsor company to analyze and evaluate the risk benefit profile of their product similarly for our product with approved rem see item business government regulation post approval phase we are required to submit periodic assessment report to the fda to demonstrate that the goal of the rem are being met rem and other risk management program are designed to ensure that drug benefit outweigh the risk and vary in the element they contain for example our esa rem requires applicable healthcare provider and institution to enroll in the program receive education about the product and the rem and document and report certain information to over time we are responsible for tracking and documenting certain element of healthcare provider and institution compliance with the esa rem and we use third party service provider to assist in the administration of certain portion of our rem if the fda is not satisfied with the result of the periodic assessment report we submit for any of our rem the fda may also modify our rem or take other regulatory action such implementing revised or restrictive labeling if regulatory agency determine that we or other party including our clinical trial investigator those operating our patient support program or licensee of our product have not complied with the applicable reporting or other pharmacovigilance requirement we may become subject to additional inspection warning letter or other enforcement action including fine marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalty our product candidate and marketed product can also be affected by safety problem or signal occurring with respect to product that are similar to and that implicate an entire class of product further result of clinical trial including sub analysis or meta analysis of earlier clinical trial meta analysis involves the use of various statistical method to combine result from previous separate but related study performed by or others concern may arise about the sufficiency of the data or study underlying product approved label such actual or perceived safety problem or concern can lead to revised or restrictive labeling for our product or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize product candidate requirement of risk management activity or other regulatory agency compliance action related to the promotion and sale of our product mandated post marketing commitment or pharmacovigilance program for our approved product product recall of our approved product revocation of approval for our product from the market completely or within particular therapeutic area or patient type increased timeline or delay in being approved by the fda or other regulatory body and or fewer treatment or product candidate being approved by regulatory body for example since when adverse safety result involving esas were observed esas continue to be the subject of ongoing review and scrutiny review by regulatory authority of the risk benefit profile of esas have resulted in and may continue to result in change to esa labeling our esa rem and usage in both the oncology and nephrology clinical setting in addition to our innovative product we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar version of number of product currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical company in some market there is not yet legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars in the united state the aca provided for such pathway while the fda continues to implement it question remain to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific product and what information can be included in biosimilar labeling see we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition in the future delay or uncertainty in the development of such pathway could result in delay or difficulty in getting our biosimilar product approved by regulatory authority subject to unanticipated development cost or otherwise reduce the value of the investment we have made in the biosimilars area further we can not predict whether any repeal or reform of the aca would affect the biosimilar pathway or have material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars in addition if we are unable to bring our biosimilar product to market on timely basis and secure first to market position our future biosimilar sale and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we may not be able to develop commercial product despite significant investment in amgen invests heavily in successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few project produce commercial product product candidate including biosimilar product candidate or new indication existing product collectively product candidate that appear promising in the early phase of development may fail to reach the market for number of reason such the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial result even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial result for reason that could include change in the standard of care of medicine the product candidate wa not effective or not more effective than currently available therapy in treating specified condition or illness the product candidate wa not cost effective in light of existing therapeutic the product candidate had harmful side effect in human or animal the necessary regulatory body such the fda or ema did not approve the product candidate for an intended use the product candidate wa not economical for to manufacture and commercialize the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or wa otherwise determined by regulatory authority to not meet applicable standard for approval other party had or may have had proprietary right relating to our product candidate such patent right and did not let sell it on reasonable term or at all we and certain of our licensee partner or independent investigator may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activity and the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidate wa uncertain or not well defined number of our product candidate have failed or been discontinued at various stage in the product development process for example in may we terminated our participation in the co development and commercialization of brodalumab with astrazeneca the decision wa based on event of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population inability to bring product to market or significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of new product for any of the reason discussed could potentially have negative impact on our product sale and earnings and could result in significant impairment of in process research and development ipr or other intangible asset we must conduct clinical trial in human before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication before we sell any product we must conduct clinical trial to demonstrate that our product candidate are safe and effective for use in human the result of those clinical trial are used the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authority such the fda and ema see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval we are required to conduct clinical trial using an appropriate number of trial site and patient to support the product label claim the length of time number of trial site and number of patient required for clinical trial vary substantially and therefore we may spend several year and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trial in addition we may have difficulty finding sufficient number of clinical trial site and patient to participate in our clinical trial particularly if competitor are conducting clinical trial in similar patient population patient may withdraw from clinical trial at any time and privacy law and or other restriction in certain country may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigator to conduct further follow on such patient which may adversely affect the interpretation of study result delay and complication in planned clinical trial can result in increased development cost associated delay in regulatory approval and in product candidate reaching the market and revision to existing product label further to increase the number of patient available for enrollment in our clinical trial we have and will continue to open clinical site and enroll patient in number of location where our experience conducting clinical trial is limited including russia india china south korea the philippine singapore and some central and south american country either through utilization of third party contract clinical trial provider entirely or in combination with local staff conducting clinical trial in location where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resource to understand the unique regulatory environment of individual country further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidate to numerous and varied clinical trial site if we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspect of our large and complex clinical trial or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply corresponding regulatory approval may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidate or could lose our ability to market existing product in certain therapeutic area or altogether if we are unable to market and sell our product or product candidate or to obtain approval in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategy our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected rely on independent third party clinical investigator to recruit patient and conduct clinical trial on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocol law and regulation further we rely on unaffiliated third party vendor to perform certain aspect of our clinical trial operation we also may acquire company that have ongoing clinical trial these trial may not have been conducted to the same standard ours however once an acquisition ha been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trial including any potential risk and liability associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trial if regulatory authority determine that we or others including our licensee or the independent investigator selected by or by company we have acquired have not complied with regulation applicable to the clinical trial those authority may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other action that could negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication if we were unable to market and sell our product or product candidate our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected in addition some of our clinical trial involve drug manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical company these drug may be administered in clinical trial in combination with one of our product or product candidate or in head to head study comparing the product or product candidate relative efficacy and safety in the event that any of these vendor or pharmaceutical company have unforeseen issue that negatively impact the quality of their work or create shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drug our ability to complete our applicable clinical trial and or evaluate clinical result may also be negatively impacted result this could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approval worldwide clinical trial must be designed based on the current standard of medical care however in certain disease such cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly in such disease the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trial may result in the design of such clinical trial being based on standard of medical care that are no longer the current standard by the time such trial are completed limiting the utility and application of such trial we may not obtain favorable clinical trial result and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidate or new indication for existing product and or maintain our current product label participant in clinical trial of our product and product candidate may also suffer adverse medical event or side effect that could among other factor delay or terminate clinical trial program and or require additional or longer trial to gain approval even after product is on the market safety concern may require additional or more extensive clinical trial part of risk management plan for our product or for approval of new indication for example in connection with the june esa label change we agreed to conduct additional clinical trial examining the use of esas in ckd additional clinical trial we initiate including those required by the fda could result in substantial additional expense and the outcome could result in further label restriction or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation additionally any negative result from such trial could materially affect the extent of approval the use reimbursement and sale of our product our business and result of operation some of our product are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic device that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risk many of our product and product candidate may be used in combination with drug delivery device such an injector or other delivery system in addition vectibix is used in combination with test kit which is companion diagnostic device and some of our product candidate may also be used in combination with companion diagnostic device our product candidate or expanded indication of our product used with such device may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if such device do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance when approval of the product and device is sought under single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval in addition some of these device may be provided by single source unaffiliated third party company we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third party company both to supply the device and in some case to conduct the study required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agency we are also dependent on those third party company continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirement failure to successfully develop or supply the device delay in or failure of the amgen or third party study or failure of or the third party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the device could result in increased development cost delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and or associated delay in product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indication for existing product actual or perceived safety problem or concern with device used with our product can lead to regulatory action and impact to our product see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval loss of regulatory approval or clearance of device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these device could adversely affect sale of the related approved product intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent right and other intellectual property right that are important to the commercialization of our product and product candidate the patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual question third party may challenge invalidate or circumvent our patent and patent application relating to our product product candidate and technology challenge to patent may come from potential competitor or from party other than those who seek to market potentially infringing product in addition our patent position might not protect against competitor with similar product or technology competing product or technology may not infringe our patent for certain of our product candidate there are third party who have patent or pending patent application that they may claim necessitate payment of royalty or prevent from commercializing these product candidate in certain territory patent dispute are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of product we have been in the past and are currently and may be in the future involved in patent litigation these matter have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturer of product that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our product for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provision of the biologics price competition and innovation act including the requirement to provide day notice in advance of commercial marketing determination made by court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review upon review such initial determination may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceeding patent dispute or litigation may not discourage potential violator from bringing the allegedly infringing product to market prior to final resolution of the dispute or litigation the period from inception until resolution of patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending we may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to fully recover from the loss damage and harm we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigation at certain stage or entirely we could be subject to competition and or significant liability be required to enter into third party license for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute in addition we can not guarantee that such license will be available on term acceptable to or at all further under the hatch waxman act our product approved by the fda under the fdca may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitor before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the hatch waxman act and prior to the expiration of the patent listed for the product likewise our innovative biologic product may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patent and with respect to competitor seeking approval biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product prior to the year exclusivity period provided under the aca in addition we may face additional patent litigation involving claim that the biosimilar product candidate we are working to develop infringe the patent of other company that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference product while we may attempt to challenge such patent our effort may be unsuccessful for information related to our biosimilars patent litigation see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement certain of the existing patent on our product have recently expired see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product patent our patent expire competitor are able to legally produce and market similar product or technology including biosimilars which may have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in addition competitor may be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patent and sell competing product guideline and recommendation published by various organization can reduce the use of our product government agency promulgate regulation and guideline directly applicable to and to our product however professional society practice management group insurance carrier physician group private health and science foundation and organization involved in various disease also publish guideline and recommendation to healthcare provider administrator and payer well patient community recommendation by government agency or other group and organization may relate to such matter usage dosage route of administration and use of related therapy and growing number of organization are providing assessment of the value and pricing of pharmaceutical product these assessment may come from private organization such the institute for clinical and economic review which publish their finding and offer recommendation relating to the product reimbursement by government and private payer in addition government hta organization such the national institute for health and clinical excellence in the united kingdom and the canadian agency for drug and technology in health make reimbursement recommendation to payer in their jurisdiction based on the clinical effectiveness cost effectiveness and service impact of new emerging and existing medicine and treatment such hta organization may recommend reimbursement for our product for narrower indication than wa approved by applicable regulatory agency or may recommend against reimbursement entirely such recommendation or guideline may affect our reputation and any or guideline that result in decreased use dosage or reimbursement of our product could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in addition the perception by the investment community or stockholder that such recommendation or guideline will result in decreased use and dosage of our product could adversely affect the market price of our common stock the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability we are subject to income and other tax in the united state and other jurisdiction in which we do business result our provision for income tax is derived from combination of applicable tax rate in the various place we operate significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax our tax return are routinely examined by tax authority in the united state and other jurisdiction in which we do business and number of audit are currently underway tax authority are becoming more aggressive in their audit and are particularly focused on the allocation of income and expense among tax jurisdiction we believe our accrual for income tax liability is appropriate based on past experience interpretation of tax law and judgment about potential action by tax authority however due to the complexity of the provision for income tax the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payment greater or le than amount accrued see part iv note income tax to the consolidated financial statement our provision for income tax and result of operation in the future could be adversely affected by change to our operating structure change in the mix of income and expense in country with differing tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability and change in applicable tax law regulation or administrative interpretation thereof president trump ha indicated that corporate tax reform is high priority for his administration and the congress is expected to propose sweeping change to the tax system including change to corporate tax rate the taxation of income earned outside the including the taxation of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings well potential destination based tax system change to the tax system change to the tax system in jurisdiction where we have significant operation such the territory of puerto rico or change in tax law in other jurisdiction where we do business could have material and adverse effect on our business and on the result of our operation we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component we rely on unaffiliated third party supplier for certain raw material medical device and component necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical product certain of those raw material medical device and component are proprietary product of those unaffiliated third party supplier and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agency so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier for example insulet corporation is our single source of the on body injector for our neulasta onpro kit also certain of the raw material required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our product are sourced from other country and or derived from biological source including mammalian tissue bovine serum and human serum albumin among the reason we may be unable to obtain these raw material medical device and component include regulatory requirement or action by regulatory agency or others adverse financial or other strategic development at or affecting the supplier including bankruptcy unexpected demand for or shortage of raw material medical device or component failure to comply with our quality standard which result in quality and product failure product contamination and or recall material shortage contamination recall and or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived substance or other raw material discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfection in raw material medical device or component and labor dispute or shortage including from the effect of health emergency and natural disaster these event could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our product or conduct clinical trial which could have material adverse effect on our product use and sale and our business and result of operation for example in prior year we have experienced shortage in certain component necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our product in our puerto rico facility further quality issue that result in unexpected additional demand for certain component may lead to shortage of required raw material or component such we have experienced with epogen glass vial we may experience or continue to experience these or other shortage in the future resulting in delayed shipment supply constraint clinical trial delay contract dispute and or stock out of our product difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale manufacturing biologic human therapeutic product is difficult complex and highly regulated we currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our product and plan to manufacture many of our product candidate in addition we currently use third party contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our product and we currently use contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our late stage product candidate and drug delivery device see item business manufacturing distribution and raw material manufacturing our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our product and product candidate is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facility and those of our third party contract manufacturer which may be impacted by capacity of manufacturing facility contamination by microorganism or virus or foreign particle from the manufacturing process natural or other disaster including hurricane earthquake volcano or fire labor dispute or shortage including the effect of health emergency or natural disaster compliance with regulatory requirement change in forecast of future demand timing and actual number of production run and production success rate and yield update of manufacturing specification contractual dispute with our supplier and contract manufacturer timing and outcome of product quality testing power failure and or other utility failure and or breakdown failure substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment if the efficient manufacture and supply of our product or product candidate is interrupted we may experience delayed shipment delay in our clinical trial supply constraint stock out adverse event trend contract dispute and or recall of our product from time to time we have initiated voluntary recall of certain lot of our product for example in july we initiated voluntary recall of an aranesp lot distributed in the eu after particle were detected in quality control sample following distribution of that lot if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our product to patient we may lose patient and physician may elect to prescribe competing therapeutic instead of our product which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation our manufacturing process and those of our third party contract manufacturer must undergo regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authority it can take longer than five year to build validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three year to qualify and license new contract manufacturer we have initiated the drug substance process qualification campaign to facilitate licensure at our biologics manufacturing facility in singapore this singapore facility will utilize novel manufacturing technology that ha not been previously approved by the fda or other regulatory authority in addition we are in the process of commercially validating and licensing new facility at the site in singapore to enable the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kyprolis if we are unable to obtain needed license for either of these facility on timely basis it could adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned risk mitigation and cost reduction which result could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation if regulatory authority determine that we or our third party contract manufacturer or certain of our third party service provider have violated regulation or if authority restrict suspend or revoke our prior approval they could prohibit from manufacturing our product or conducting clinical trial or selling our marketed product until we or the affected third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider comply or indefinitely such issue may also delay the approval of product candidate we have submitted for regulatory review even if such product candidate are not directly related to the product device or process at issue with regulator because our third party contract manufacturer and certain of our third party service provider are subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority alternative qualified third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider may not be available on timely basis or at all if we or our third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider cease or interrupt production or if our third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider fail to supply material product or service to we may experience delayed shipment supply constraint stock out and or recall of our product additionally we distribute substantial volume of our commercial product through our primary distribution center in louisville kentucky for the united state and in breda netherlands for europe and much of the rest of the world we also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our product distributed in europe and much of the rest of the world in breda our to timely supply product is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our distribution and logistics center our third party logistics provider and our labeling and packaging facility in breda further we rely on commercial transportation including air freight for the distribution of our product to our customer which may be negatively impacted by natural disaster or security threat we perform substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activity at our facility in the territory of puerto rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activity at our facility in thousand oak california if significant disruption or production failure occur at the puerto rico facility we may not be able to supply these product or at the thousand oak facility we may not be able to continue our clinical trial we currently perform substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activity at our facility in the territory of puerto rico and substantially all of our clinical manufacturing activity at our facility in thousand oak california the global supply of our product and product candidate for commercial sale and for use in our clinical trial is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of these facility see manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale the operation of our manufacturing facility in puerto rico is also subject to local economic challenge since june when the governor of puerto rico announced that the government including certain government entity wa unable to pay it roughly billion in debt the government liquidity position ha continued to deteriorate and public report indicate that the puerto rico government is not making certain payment with respect to it obligation on june president obama signed into law the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa to provide mechanism for puerto rico to restructure it debt achieve fiscal responsibility and gain access to capital market promesa established federal financial oversight and management board oversight board to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plan and budget for puerto rico and to assist in the debt restructuring the establishment of the oversight board initially provided for an automatic stay of creditor action against the puerto rico government until february and recently extended the automatic stay until may the puerto rico government is expected to submit fiscal plan to the oversight board by february additionally on january the puerto rico government signed into law the puerto rico fiscal emergency and fiscal responsibility act the act which is intended to facilitate and encourage voluntary negotiation process under promesa the puerto rico government and it creditor the act declares state of financial emergency in puerto rico until may and authorizes the governor to designate certain service essential service and other service non essential in order to prioritize the use of available resource to satisfy puerto rico obligation while promesa and the action above continue to be important factor in moving puerto rico toward economic stability there is still risk that puerto rico economic situation could impact the territorial government provision of utility or other service in puerto rico that we use in the operation of our business create the potential for increased tax or fee to operate in puerto rico result in migration of worker from puerto rico to the mainland united state and or make it more expensive or difficult for to operate in puerto rico concentration of sale at certain of our wholesaler distributor and free standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payer may negatively impact our business certain of our distributor customer and payer have substantial purchasing leverage due to the volume of our product they purchase or the number of patient life for which they provide coverage the substantial majority of our product sale is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributor amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc these distributor in turn sell our product to their customer which include physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy one of our product epogen is sold primarily to free standing dialysis clinic two organization davita and fresenius medical care

significant consolidation in the health insurance industry including that three pbms now oversee approximately of total covered life in the united state see item risk factor our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability the concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entity may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discount on our product fee for other service or rebate negatively impacting our bargaining position sale and or profit margin in addition decision by these entity to purchase or cover le or none of our product in favor of competitive product could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation due to their purchasing volume we may not be able to access the capital and credit market on term that are favorable to or at all the capital and credit market may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issue for both borrower and investor we expect to access the capital market to supplement our existing fund and cash generated from operation in satisfying our need for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirement our plan to pay dividend and repurchase stock and other business initiative we plan to strategically pursue including acquisition and licensing in the event of adverse capital and credit market condition we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation change in credit rating issued by nationally recognized credit rating agency could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our security our effort to acquire other company or product and to integrate their operation may not be successful and may result in unanticipated cost delay or failure to realize the benefit of the transaction we have an ongoing process of evaluating potential merger acquisition partnering and in license opportunity that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint product offering and or our pipeline acquisition may result in unanticipated cost delay or other operational or financial problem related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may result in the diversion of our management attention from other business issue and opportunity failure or difficulty in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operation of the business we acquire including their technology compliance program distribution and general business operation and procedure while preserving important distribution marketing promotion and other relationship may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charge for example on october we acquired onyx pharmaceutical inc onyx biopharmaceutical company with several currently marketed product well pipeline candidate progressing through the development process and failure or difficulty in the integration of onyx could result in material adverse impact on our business and result of operation our sale and operation are subject to the risk of doing business in emerging market we continue our expansion effort in emerging market around the world through acquisition and licensing transaction well through the development and introduction of our product in new market we face numerous risk to our business there is no guarantee that our effort and strategy to expand sale in emerging market will succeed emerging market country may be especially vulnerable to period of global political legal regulatory and financial instability including sovereign debt issue and or the imposition of international sanction in response to certain state action we expand internationally we are subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar while we have program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation through foreign currency hedging arrangement our hedging effort do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuation on our revenue and earnings we may also be required to increase our reliance on third party agent and unfamiliar operation and arrangement previously utilized by company we partner with or acquire in emerging market see we must conduct clinical trial in human before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication our international operation and business may also be subject to le protective intellectual property or other applicable law diverse data privacy and protection requirement changing tax law and tariff far reaching anti bribery and anti corruption law and regulation and or evolving legal and regulatory environment these legal and operational challenge along with government control the challenge of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approval of our product may result in material adverse impact on our international product sale business and result of operation our business may be affected by litigation and government investigation we and certain of our subsidiary are involved in legal proceeding see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdict fine and penalty exclusion from federal healthcare program and or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business defense of litigation claim can be expensive time consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgment or enter into settlement of claim for monetary damage or change the way we operate our business which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition product liability is major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical product we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trial and for product we sell after regulatory approval product liability claim regardless of their merit could be costly and divert management attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our product we and certain of our subsidiary have previously been named defendant in product liability action for certain of our product we are also involved in government investigation that arise in the ordinary course of our business in recent year there ha been trend of increasing government investigation and litigation against company operating in our industry both in the united state and around the world our business activity outside of the united state are subject to the fcpa and similar anti bribery or anti corruption law regulation or rule of other country in which we operate including the uk bribery act we announced on december we finalized settlement agreement with the government and various other party to settle certain allegation regarding our sale and marketing practice in connection with that settlement we are now operating under corporate integrity agreement cia with the oig of the department of health and human service that requires to maintain our corporate compliance program and to undertake set of defined corporate integrity obligation until december the cia also provides for an independent third party review organization to ass and report on our compliance while we expect to fully comply with all of our obligation under the cia failure to do so could result in substantial penalty and our being excluded from government healthcare program we may also be subject to action by government entity including those not participating in the settlement and may in the future become subject to claim by other party in each case with respect to the alleged conduct that is the subject of the settlement we may see new government investigation of or action against citing novel theory of recovery any of these result could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we are increasingly dependent on information technology system infrastructure network connected control system and data security we are increasingly dependent on information technology system infrastructure network connected control system and data security the breadth complexity and business process integration of our computer system and the potential value of our data make these system target of service interruption destruction malicious intrusion and attack likewise data privacy or security breach by employee contractor or others may pose risk that sensitive data including intellectual property trade secret or personal information belonging our patient customer and or other business partner may be exposed to unauthorized person or the public global biotechnology company our system are subject to frequent cyber attack moreover these attack are growing in frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect the cyber threat landscape evolves such attack are also increasingly difficult to detect when carried out by motivated well resourced skilled and persistent actor including nation state and organized crime group such attack could include the deployment of harmful malware key logger denial of service delivery of malware through malicious website the use of social engineering and or other mean to affect the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology system process infrastructure and data key business partner third party service and product provider and any company we may acquire face similar risk and any security breach of their system could adversely affect our security and resiliency posture although in the past we have experienced cyber attack and intrusion into our computer system we do not believe such attack have had material adverse effect on our operation while we continue to invest in the protection and monitoring of our critical or sensitive data and information technology there can be no assurance that our effort will prevent service interruption or detect all breach to our system that could adversely affect our business and operation and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to global economic condition may negatively affect and may magnify certain risk that affect our business our operation and performance have been and may continue to be affected by global economic condition financial pressure may cause government or other third party payer to more aggressively seek cost containment measure see our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability result of global economic condition some third party payer may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligation job loss or other economic hardship may also affect patient ability to afford health care result of increased co pay or deductible obligation greater cost sensitivity to existing co pay or deductible obligation lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reason we believe such condition have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation economic condition may also adversely affect the ability of our distributor customer and supplier to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw material and to perform their obligation under agreement with which could disrupt our operation although we monitor our distributor customer and supplier financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risk some of our distributor customer and supplier may become insolvent which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation we maintain significant portfolio of investment disclosed cash equivalent and marketable security on our consolidated balance sheet the value of our investment may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuation downgrade in credit rating illiquidity in the capital market and other factor that may result in other than temporary decline in the value of our investment any of those event could cause to record impairment charge with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize loss on sale of investment our stock price is volatile our stock price like that of our peer in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is volatile our revenue and operating result may fluctuate from period to period for number of reason event such delay in product development change to our expectation or strategy or even relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial result for period to be below our expectation or projection result our revenue and operating result and in turn our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuation announcement or discussion of possible restrictive action by government or private payer that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate

obligation obligation tax benefit utbs total contractual obligation long term debt obligation include future interest payment on our fixed rate obligation at the contractual coupon rate to achieve desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt we entered into interest rate swap contract that effectively converted fixed rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuance to floating

obligation to pay certain of these amount may be reduced based on certain future event liability for utbs net of foreign tax credit and federal tax benefit of state tax and related accrued interest and penalty totaling approximately billion at december are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflow and other event that extinguish these liability in addition to amount in the table above we are contractually obligated to pay additional amount which in the aggregate are significant upon the achievement of various development regulatory and commercial milestone for agreement we have entered into with third party including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisition of dezima pharma dezima and biovex group inc biovex these payment are contingent upon the occurrence of various future event substantially all of which have high degree of uncertainty of occurring these contingent payment have not been included in the table above and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligation are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreement we have entered into with third party is approximately billion including billion of contingent consideration payment in connection with the acquisition of dezima and biovex see part iv note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement summary of critical accounting policiesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the financial statement and the note to the financial statement some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and therefore actual result could differ materially from those estimate under different assumption or condition sale and sale deductionsrevenues from sale of our product are recognized when the product are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed product sale are recorded net of accrual for estimated rebate wholesaler chargebacks cash discount and other deduction collectively sale deduction and return which are established at the time of sale we analyze the adequacy of our accrual for sale deduction quarterly amount accrued for sale deduction are adjusted when trend or significant event indicate that adjustment is appropriate accrual are also adjusted to reflect actual result amount recorded in accrued liability in the consolidated balance sheet for sale deduction were follows in million rebate chargebacks other deduction totalbalance of january charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december the year ended december and total sale deduction were and of gross product sale respectively included in the amount are immaterial net adjustment related to prior year sale due to change in estimate such amount represent le than of the aggregate sale deduction charged against product sale in each of the three year ended december in the united state we utilize wholesaler the principal mean of distributing our product to healthcare provider such physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy product we sell in europe are distributed principally to hospital and or wholesaler depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold we monitor the inventory level of our product at our wholesaler by using data from our wholesaler and other third party and we believe wholesaler inventory have been maintained at appropriate level generally two to three week given end user demand accordingly historical fluctuation in wholesaler inventory level have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sale deduction and return accrual for sale deduction are based primarily on estimate of the amount earned or to be claimed on the related sale these estimate take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirement specific known market event and trend internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying pattern sale deduction are substantially product specific and therefore for any given year can be impacted by the mix of product sold rebate include primarily amount paid to payer and provider in the united state including those paid to state medicaid program and are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which vary by product by payer and by individual payer plan we sell product we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold contractual term estimated patient population historical experience and wholesaler inventory level and accrue these rebate in the period the related sale is recorded we then adjust the rebate accrual more information becomes available and to reflect actual claim experience estimating such rebate is complicated in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebate is reasonable and appropriate given current fact and circumstance but actual result may differ wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreement to sell product to healthcare provider in the united state at fixed price that are lower than the price we charge wholesaler when healthcare provider purchase our product through wholesaler at these reduced price wholesaler charge for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between amgen and the healthcare provider the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sale by our wholesaler customer to healthcare provider accrual for wholesaler chargebacks are le difficult to estimate than rebate and closely approximate actual result since chargeback amount are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and we generally settle the liability for these deduction within few week returnsreturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sale on production lot basis historical rate of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected change in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate in each of the past three year sale return provision have amounted to le than of gross product sale change in estimate for prior year sale return provision have historically been insignificant income taxeswe provide for income tax based on pretax income and applicable tax rate available in the various jurisdiction in which we operate we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement on particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized the amount of utbs is adjusted appropriate for change in fact and circumstance such significant amendment to existing tax law new regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient for any assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty where appropriate related to utbs in income tax expense certain item are included in our tax return at different time than they are reflected in the financial statement and cause temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount such temporary difference create deferred tax asset and liability deferred tax asset are generally item that can be used tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future year but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statement we establish valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liability are either tax expense recognized in the financial statement for which payment ha been deferred ii expense for which we have already taken deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized the expense in the financial statement or iii liability for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible asset acquired in many business combination future expense associated with these asset most often will not be tax deductible we are vertically integrated enterprise with operation in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction we are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdiction where we conduct activity based on the tax law and principle of such jurisdiction and the function risk and activity performed therein our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign source based on the operation performed and risk assumed in each location and the tax law and principle of the respective taxing jurisdiction for example we conduct significant operation in puerto rico territory of the united state that is treated foreign jurisdiction for tax purpose pertaining to manufacturing distribution and other related function to meet our worldwide product demand income from our operation in puerto rico is subject to tax incentive grant through our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no income tax or foreign withholding tax have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united state substantially all of this benefit is attributable to our foreign income associated with our operation conducted in puerto rico if future event including material change in cash working capital and long term investment requirement necessitate that certain asset associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united state under current tax law an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable income tax rate which could have material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial result our operation are subject to the tax law regulation and administrative practice of the united state state jurisdiction and other country in which we do business significant change in these rule could have material adverse effect on our result of operation see part item risk factor the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceeding and other matter such intellectual property dispute contractual dispute governmental investigation and class action suit which are complex in nature and have outcome that are difficult to predict certain of these proceeding are discussed in part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement we record accrual for loss contingency to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated we consider all relevant factor when making assessment regarding these contingency it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these item an adverse determination in one or more of these item currently pending could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow valuation of asset and liability in connection with business combinationswe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible asset in connection with business combination these intangible asset consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic product and ipr product candidate discounted cash flow model are typically used to determine the fair value of these intangible asset for purpose of allocating consideration paid to the net asset acquired in business combination these model require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to determining the timing and expected cost to complete in process project taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agency for product candidate estimating the timing of and future net cash flow from product sale resulting from completed product and in process project and developing appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flow significant estimate and assumption are also required to determine the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination in addition we must revalue these obligation each subsequent reporting period until the related contingency are resolved and record change in their fair value in earnings the acquisition date fair value of various contingent consideration obligation incurred or assumed in the acquisition of business see part iv note business combination and note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement were determined using combination of valuation technique significant estimate and assumption required for these valuation included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestone product sale projection under various scenario and discount rate used to calculate the present value of the required payment these estimate and assumption are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligation each reporting period accordingly subsequent change in underlying fact and circumstance could result in change in these estimate and assumption which could have material impact on the estimated future fair value of these obligation we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired and contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date impairment of long lived assetswe review the carrying value of our property plant and equipment and our finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if such circumstance exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow to be generated by the long lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value indefinite lived intangible asset composed of ipr project acquired in business combination which have not reached technological feasibility or lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition are reviewed for impairment annually whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the asset carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and it carrying value is reduced accordingly estimating future cash flow of an ipr product candidate for purpose of an impairment analysis requires to make significant estimate and assumption regarding the amount and timing of cost to complete the project and the amount timing and probability of achieving revenue from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project wa determined described above there are often major risk and uncertainty associated with ipr project we are required to obtain regulatory approval in order to be able to market these product such approval require completing clinical trial that demonstrate product candidate is safe and effective consequently the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr project may vary from it estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and ipr impairment charge may occur in future period which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation believe our estimation of future cash flow used for assessing impairment of long lived asset are based on reasonable assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related date of the assessment item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk that may result from change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and price of equity instrument well change in general economic condition in the country where we conduct business to reduce certain of these risk we enter into various type of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transaction part of our risk management program we do not use derivative for speculative trading purpose in the discussion that follows we have assumed hypothetical change in interest rate of basis point from those at december and we have also assumed hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate against the dollar based on it position relative to other currency of december and interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsour portfolio of available for sale interest bearing security at december and wa composed of treasury security and other government related debt security corporate debt security residential mortgage backed and other mortgage and asset backed security money market mutual fund and other short term interest bearing security composed principally of commercial paper the fair value of our investment portfolio of interest bearing security were billion and billion at december and respectively duration is sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of security that will result from basis point change in interest rate applying duration model hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these security of approximately million and million respectively on these date in addition hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate at december and would not result in material effect on income in the respective ensuing year of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion our outstanding debt wa composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rate the carrying value of variable rate debt were billion and billion at december and respectively change in interest rate do not affect interest expense on fixed rate debt change in interest rate would however affect the fair value of fixed rate debt hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion and billion respectively in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these date the analysis for the debt doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related interest rate swap contract and cross currency swap contract discussed below to achieve desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt we entered into interest rate swap contract which qualified and were designated for accounting purpose fair value hedge for certain of our fixed rate debt these interest rate swap contract effectively converted fixed rate interest coupon to floating rate libor based coupon over the life of the respective note interest rate swap contract with an aggregate notional amount of billion were outstanding at december and hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in fair value of approximately million and million respectively on our interest rate swap contract on these date and would not result in material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing year the analysis for the interest rate swap contract doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related fair value of debt that these interest rate sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had outstanding cross currency swap contract with aggregate notional amount of billion and billion respectively that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payment these contract effectively convert interest payment and principal repayment of this debt to dollar from euro pound sterling and are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rate relative to interest rate at december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contract of approximately million and million respectively foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsour international operation are affected by fluctuation in the value of the dollar compared to foreign currency predominantly the euro increase and decrease in our international product sale from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our international operating expense increase and decrease in our foreign currency denominated asset from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our foreign currency denominated liability to further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuation on our result of operation we enter into foreign currency forward option and cross currency swap contract of december we had outstanding euro pound sterling and swiss franc denominated debt with carrying value and fair value of billion of december we had euro and pound sterling denominated debt with carrying value and fair value of billion and billion respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately billion on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately billion hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of approximately million on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of approximately million the impact on income from these hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would be substantially offset by the impact such change would have on related cross currency swap contract which are in place for the majority of the foreign currency denominated debt we have cross currency swap contract that are designated cash flow hedge of certain of our debt denominated in euro pound sterling and swiss franc with aggregate notional amount of billion and billion of december and respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these contract of approximately billion and million on these date respectively the impact on income in the ensuing year from these contract of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt we enter into foreign currency forward and option contract that are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge of certain anticipated foreign currency transaction of december we had open foreign currency forward and option contract primarily euro based with notional amount of billion and million respectively of december we had open foreign currency forward and option contract primarily euro based with notional amount of billion and million respectively of december and the fair value of these contract were approximately million and million respectively with regard to foreign currency forward and option contract that were open at december hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and in the ensuing year reduction in income of approximately million with regard to contract that were open at december hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and in the ensuing year reduction in income of approximately million the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on anticipated transaction that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had open foreign currency forward contract with notional amount totaling million and million respectively that hedged fluctuation of certain asset and liability denominated in foreign currency but were not designated hedge for accounting purpose these contract had no material net unrealized gain or loss at december and with regard to these foreign currency forward contract that were open at december and hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would not have material effect on the fair value of these contract or related income in the respective ensuing year the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on asset and liability that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset market price sensitive financial instrumentsas of december and we were also exposed to price risk on equity security included in our portfolio of investment which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objective these investment are generally in small capitalization stock in the biotechnology industry sector price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio of december and wa not material counterparty credit risksour financial instrument including derivative are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider part of the overall fair value measurement our financial risk management policy limit derivative transaction by requiring transaction to be with institution with minimum credit rating of or equivalent by and moody and requires placing exposure limit on the amount with any individual counterparty in addition we have an investment policy that limit investment to certain type of debt and money market instrument issued by institution primarily with investment grade credit rating and place restriction on maturity and

interim and annual period beginning on january we are currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statement in january the fasb issued new accounting standard that change the definition of business to assist entity with evaluating when set of asset acquired or disposed of should be considered business the new standard requires an entity to evaluate if substantially all the fair value of the gross asset acquired is concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset if so the set would not be considered business the new standard also requires business to include at least one substantive process and narrow the definition of output we expect that these provision will reduce the number of transaction that will be considered business the new standard is effective for interim and annual period beginning on january and may be adopted earlier the standard would be applied prospectively to any transaction occurring on or after the adoption date we are currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statement restructuringin we initiated restructuring plan to invest

tax liability of million this valuation reflects delayed development pending competitor clinical trial in this class expected in the estimated fair value of acquired ipr related to amg wa determined using probability weighted income approach which discount expected future cash flow to present value using discount rate that represents the estimated rate that market participant would use to value the asset the projected cash flow were based on certain assumption including estimate of future revenue and expense the time and resource needed to complete development and the probability of obtaining marketing approval from regulatory agency the excess of the acquisition date consideration over the fair value assigned to the asset acquired and the liability assumed of million wa recorded goodwill which is not deductible for tax purpose goodwill is attributable primarily to the expected synergy and other benefit that we believe will result from expanding our cardiovascular portfolio with amg and the deferred tax consequence of acquired ipr recorded for financial statement purpose pro forma result of operation for this acquisition have not been presented because this acquisition

successfully complete these task within budgeted cost we are not able to market human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approval and such approval require completing clinical trial that

independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the input that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstance the fair value hierarchy is divided into three level based on the source of input follows level valuation based on unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability that the company ha the ability to accesslevel valuation for which all significant input are observable either directly or indirectly other than level inputslevel valuation based on input that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurementthe availability of observable input can vary among the various type of financial asset and liability to the extent that the valuation is based on model or input that are le observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment in certain case the input used for measuring fair value may fall into different level of the fair value hierarchy in such case for financial statement disclosure purpose the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input used that is significant to the overall fair value measurement fair value of each major class of the company
