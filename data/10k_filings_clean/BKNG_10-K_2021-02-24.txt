legislative activity in the area of privacy data protection and information and cyber security governing part of our business continues to increase worldwide we have established and continue to maintain policy and global governance framework to comply with law that apply to our business meet evolving stakeholder expectation and support business innovation and growth in the european union for example the general data protection regulation the gdpr imposes significant compliance obligation and cost for in the united state the california consumer privacy act the ccpa and the recently enacted california privacy right act cpra set to become operative in january impose new privacy requirement and right for consumer in california that will result in additional compliance complexity risk and cost some data protection and privacy law afford consumer private right of action against company like for certain statutory violation many other jurisdiction continually propose and consider enacting

we the travel industry and the technology industry generally are subject to competition and consumer protection law and regulation around the world that impact aspect of our business including among others contractual parity arrangement with accommodation provider and the manner in which we display information on our platform there is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry especially technology company become larger including in relation to the regulation of digital platform the european commission proposed digital market act and digital service act legislation is expected to give regulator more instrument to investigate digital business and impose new rule on certain digital platform if they are determined to be gatekeeper regulation of the travel industry our business could be impacted by travel related regulation such those imposed by local jurisdiction to regulate the use of alternative accommodation and address the issue of overtourism our business evolves in particular we offer linked travel arrangement or travel package part of the connected trip we expect to become subject to existing and new regulation for example some part of our business are already subject to certain requirement of the eu package travel directive the package directive and our offering continue to diversify and expand we may become subject to additional requirement of the package directive payment we expand our payment service to consumer and business partner we will likely become subject to additional regulation such financial service regulation and license requirement which could result in increased compliance cost and complexity including those associated with the implementation of new or more stringent internal control we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with payment card processor including the payment card industry data security standard compliance with which is complex and costly for further discussion of these regulation and how other global regulation may impact our business see item risk factor legal tax regulatory compliance and reputational risk operation and technology our business is supported by multiple system and platform which designed with an emphasis on scalability performance reliability redundancy and security these system and platform are generally independent among our brand though some have become increasingly connected or shared our software system platform and architecture use variety of widely used software tool and database system these internal system and platform are designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such accommodation airline ticket and rental car reservation system and financial service provider well individual accommodation service provider such independent hotel our application utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our worldwide operation are primarily hosted in the united kingdom switzerland the netherlands germany singapore hong kong and four location in the united state each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure and hour monitoring and engineering support typical of hosted data center all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back system although we take step to mitigate the effect of any loss or reduction in at one of our hosting facility if hosting facility were inaccessible or otherwise experienced disruption in service for any reason we could experience disruption to our service loss of transaction and revenue and consumer complaint we provide customer service through mix of in house call center and outsourced third party service intellectual property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering our service we regard the protection of our intellectual property important to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on national federal state and common law right in the united state and internationally well variety of administrative procedure regulation convention and treaty we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right in our service we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party see part item risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property seasonality and other timing factorsin recent year and prior to the covid pandemic the majority of our gross booking are generated in the first half of the year consumer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we generally recognize revenue from these booking when the travel begin at check in which can be in quarter other than when the associated reservation are booked in contrast we expense the substantial majority of our marketing activity the expense is incurred which in the case of performance marketing in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservation were booked result of this timing difference when we recorded marketing expense and when we recognized associated revenue we had our highest level of profitability in the third quarter of the year which is when there were the highest level of accommodation check in for the year for our european and north american market the first quarter of the year wa typically our lowest level of profitability and highest level of volatility in earnings growth rate due to these seasonal timing factor the covid pandemic impacted seasonality in for example we witnessed higher share of travel being booked during the second and third quarter well higher share of stay during the third quarter than in prior year we can not currently predict travel pattern given the covid pandemic and we may not experience typical seasonality effect on our business in additionally in the third and fourth quarter we saw significant contraction of the booking window versus the comparable prior year period an increased percentage of newly booked room night were made for travel that wa to occur close to the time of booking we expect that the length of the booking window will be volatile and difficult to predict throughout the duration of the covid pandemic future change in the length of the booking window will affect the degree to which our gross booking and revenue occur in the same period and result whether our gross booking growth rate and revenue growth rate converge or diverge for additional information regarding factor affecting the seasonality of our business see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation seasonality and other timing matter human capital resource we believe our employee are one of the most important asset we have to further our mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world in order to continue to deliver on this mission our goal is to attract develop and retain highly skilled talent with significant focus on diverse workforce operating in an inclusive environment in the past year the covid pandemic ha had significant impact on our workforce and our human capital management workforcepart of our strategy is to operate multiple brand to appeal to different consumer pursue different marketing and business strategy encourage experimentation and innovation provide different service offering and focus on different market while we continue to increase the collaboration cooperation and interdependency among our brand this model inherently result in diversity of culture among our brand which may manifest in different approach to human capital management in certain area at december we employed approximately employee of which approximately were based in the united state and approximately were based outside the united state approximately of our employee are full time employee we also retain independent contractor including to support our customer service website content translation and system support function result of the covid pandemic we made the difficult decision to restructure our workforce to align our total cost structure with our expectation of reduced near to medium term market demand for travel and restaurant reservation service although we took various step to maintain job and reduce the need for workforce reduction including participating in various wage assistance program our total workforce decreased by approximately year over year of december primarily due to combination of our restructuring action and attrition throughout the restructuring process we have prioritized treating our colleague with fairness and respect by among other thing offering severance package an employee assistance program with access to counseling service and job placement support diversity inclusion and belongingwe believe that diverse workforce operating in an inclusive environment is critical to leveraging our human capital to achieve our long term strategic goal particularly in the technology industry where many population remain underrepresented we strive for our leadership and workforce to reflect the broad spectrum of customer and partner we work with throughout the world because we believe this is the best way for to connect with the broad viewpoint background and experience of our customer and partner in addition we maintain workplace that embrace the different culture and practice of our diverse employee and is consistent with our code of conduct we believe we abide by the law and regulation that govern our employment practice and we prohibit unlawful discrimination of any type of december approximately of our employee were woman approximately of our technology position were filled by woman and approximately of our extended leadership team which includes the company senior leadership and extends to level the chief executive officer of each brand company depending on the number of employee within each brand were woman we are committed to pay equity regardless of gender race or ethnicity with the help of our independent compensation consultant mercer we conduct pay equity study every other year and in the year we work on remediation plan to address outlier we support equality and inclusiveness across our workforce through various initiative at all the brand company for example booking com ha several employee resource group including able to support

fostering greater workplace inclusion with initiative such the agoda color and woman at agoda at priceline the woman impacting priceline resource group is empowering woman to champion their professional development and improve gender intelligence we are proud of the progress we have made in this space and recognize we can always improve part of advancing these initiative involves facilitating pipeline of candidate for open position that are representative of the spectrum of community we serve kayak and opentable are diversifying their job board posting and partnering with underrepresented group such historically black college and university in the united state priceline is also partnering with organization to access more diverse candidate and ha rewritten job description to be more appealing to broader audience of candidate additionally we are entering our fifth year of operating our woman in leadership program which is company wide initiative designed to support the advancement and development of high performing woman within the company with the goal of building and enabling gender diversity in our executive pipeline attraction development and retentionwe work diligently to attract the best and most innovative talent from diverse range of source to grow our business and achieve our long term strategic goal we believe that we offer rich

united state our employee benefit plan generally include coverage for infertility treatment gender reassignment surgery gender neutral domestic partner benefit and paid parental leave despite the challenge of shifting the vast majority of our workforce to work from home due to the covid pandemic we continue to prioritize and invest in creating opportunity for employee to grow and build their career through training and development program these include offering tailored learning opportunity to enable employee to upskill while at work and driving deliberate career conversation between employee and their manager well executive talent and succession planning we measure organizational culture and engagement to build on the competency that are important for our future success the disruption stemming from the covid pandemic have presented particularly unique challenge to keeping employee engaged and supported at work we shifted our approach to employee engagement in response to changing employee need in mostly virtual workplace by for example providing regular video based ceo update and virtual mental wellness workshop we regularly touch base with our employee through formal engagement survey work from home and quick pulse survey to request feedback on the employee experience the result of these effort are shared with senior management at each of our brand analyze area of progress or prioritize area for improvement in order to encourage and sustain employee engagement we are particularly proud that notwithstanding the difficulty faced by our employee due to the effect of covid on how we live and work well the difficult restructuring action taken by the company the result of our employee engagement survey demonstrate committed and engaged workforce response to covid pandemicthroughout the crisis of the covid pandemic we have prioritized the health and safety of our employee we recognize that our employee have been faced with unprecedented challenge both professionally and personally and result we have increased the frequency of scheduled communication between management and the workforce offered additional unscheduled holiday shifted the vast majority of our workforce to work from home offered additional meditation and wellness benefit to support employee mental well being encouraged alteration to meeting schedule during the work week to combat virtual meeting fatigue and designated specific day or period in the year quiet period in recognition of the need for employee to rest and recharge regulatoryalthough we have work council or employee representative in certain country our employee are not represented by labor union and are not covered by collective bargaining agreement throughout the restructuring process we worked in close collaboration with work council employee representative and other organization in the relevant jurisdiction we have never had work stoppage and we consider our relation with our employee to be good for more information see part item risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled employee and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employee or hire retain and motivate well

and regulation and reliance on third party fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate and other risk associated with doing business in multiple currency and jurisdiction success of investment and acquisition including integration of acquired business and financial risk including increased debt level and stock price volatility industry and business risksthe covid pandemic ha materially adversely affected and may further adversely impact our business and financial performance in response to the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid the covid pandemic many government around the world have implemented and continue to implement variety of measure to reduce the spread of covid including travel restriction and ban instruction to resident to practice social distancing curfew quarantine advisory including quarantine restriction after travel in certain location shelter in place order required closure of non essential business and additional restriction on business part of opening plan these government mandate have forced many of the partner on whom our business relies including hotel and other accommodation provider airline and to seek government support in order to continue operating to curtail drastically their service offering to file for bankruptcy protection or to cease operation entirely further these measure have materially adversely affected and may further adversely affect consumer sentiment and discretionary spending pattern economy and financial market and our workforce operation and customer the covid pandemic and the resulting economic condition and government order have resulted in material decrease in consumer spending and an unprecedented decline in travel and restaurant activity and consumer demand for related service our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent on the sale of such travel and restaurant related service our result for the year ended december were significantly and negatively impacted with material decline in gross booking room night booked total revenue net income and cash flow from operation compared to due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current condition around the world we are unable to predict accurately the impact that the covid pandemic will have on our business going forward newly booked room night reservation excluding the impact of cancellation declined rapidly the covid pandemic spread in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of but steadily improved through the end of the second quarter and into the summer travel period in the third quarter of in september variant of covid that spread more easily and quickly than other variant were discovered and have since spread to other country in the fourth quarter of multiple covid vaccine were approved for widespread distribution throughout various part of the world including the united state and in europe while this news is encouraging it is still unknown when these vaccine will be available to broader population and whether they will be effective against variant of covid including the variant mentioned in the fourth quarter of we saw room night decline further well an increase in cancellation rate in each case compared to the third quarter of in january room night declined slightly more than the decline in the fourth quarter of however we have seen some improvement in these booking trend in recent week if these recent trend were to continue we currently expect that room night and gross booking in the first quarter of will decline relative to the first quarter of by percentage point le than those metric declined in the fourth quarter of relative to the fourth quarter of we currently expect revenue in the first quarter of to decline by similar amount our expected decline in gross booking in the first quarter of both relative to the first quarter of the comparison of the first quarter of to the first quarter of avoids the distortion created from comparing to the initial spread of the covid pandemic late in the first quarter of in addition we currently expect that we will experience greater operating loss in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of with the continued spread of covid and other variant throughout the world we expect the covid pandemic and it effect to continue to have significant adverse impact on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow for the duration of the pandemic during any resurgence of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery which could be an extended period of time we believe that effective vaccine become widely distributed people will feel it is safe to travel again and government restriction will be relaxed although the timing remains uncertain the extent of the effect of the covid pandemic on our business result of operation cash flow and growth prospect is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future development these include but are not limited to the severity extent and duration of the global pandemic including result of any new variant of covid and any resurgence of the pandemic and it impact on the travel and restaurant industry and consumer spending more broadly action taken by national state and local government to contain the disease or treat it impact including travel restriction and ban required closure of non essential business constraint on business during reopening transition and aid and economic stimulus effort the effect of our restructuring activity and attrition well the change in hiring level and remote working arrangement that we have implemented on our operation including the health and productivity of management and our employee and our ability to maintain our financial reporting process and related control the impact on our contract and relationship with our partner including the impact of invoking force majeure provision our ability to withstand increased cyberattacks that we and many business are experiencing the speed and extent of the recovery across the broader travel ecosystem including the speed at which customer feel comfortable traveling again once restriction on travel have been lifted which we believe will be impacted by how quickly there can be effective and widespread vaccination treatment or cure and the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer spending including the length and the severity of the economic recession resulting from the pandemic the pandemic may continue to expand throughout the world and or worsen in area that had seen progress in reducing or containing the disease which could continue to affect our business also existing restriction in affected region could be extended after the virus ha been contained in order to avoid relapse and there may be restriction on certain travel activity related to whether traveler have been vaccinated our business is dependent on the availability of large number of accommodation particularly independently owned accommodation and restaurant and on the ability of consumer to travel to such accommodation and restaurant on airline railway and rental car the ability of consumer to travel internationally ha been significantly impacted by the various travel restriction between country including for example the restriction on travel between the european union and the united state we do not expect economic and operating condition for our business to improve consumer are once again willing and able to travel and our travel service provider and restaurant partner are once again willing and able to serve those this may not occur until well after the broader global economy begin to improve additionally our business is also dependent on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending pattern increased unemployment resulting from the covid pandemic is likely to have negative impact on consumer discretionary spending including for the travel and restaurant industry even if economic and operating condition for our business improve we can not predict the long term effect of the pandemic on our business or the travel and restaurant industry whole if the travel and restaurant industry are fundamentally changed by the covid pandemic in way that are detrimental to our operating model our business may continue to be adversely affected even the broader global economy recovers to the extent that the covid pandemic continues to adversely affect our business and financial performance it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk identified in this section such those relating to our substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness utilization of governmental stimulus package may negatively impact our business operation and or reputation certain government have passed or are considering legislation to help business during the covid pandemic through loan wage subsidy tax relief or other financial aid and some of these government have extended or are considering extending these program we have participated in several of these program including the netherlands wage subsidy program and the united kingdom job retention scheme in some case these program restrict the ability of participating company to take certain action such restructurings while participating in the program though we are not currently under any such restriction additionally in certain jurisdiction there ha been public scrutiny of government aid beneficiary including and result our reputation could be harmed by participated in these program or participating in the future impairment of goodwill long term investment and long lived asset increase in provision for expected credit loss on receivables from and cash advance made to our travel service provider and restaurant partner and increase in cash outlay to refund consumer for prepaid reservation have negative impact on our result of operation result of the deterioration of our business due to the covid pandemic we evaluated goodwill long term investment and long lived asset for possible impairment of march result of this evaluation we determined that our goodwill relating to opentable and kayak experienced decline in value due to the covid pandemic and therefore we recognized goodwill impairment charge of million which is non deductible for income tax purpose of march in addition we recorded an impairment charge of million at march related to our investment in didi chuxing due to the impact of the covid pandemic on the business of the investee and our estimate of the resulting decline in the value of the investment of september we performed our annual goodwill impairment testing result of this testing we recognized an additional goodwill impairment charge of million which is non deductible for income tax purpose for the three month ended september relating to opentable and kayak the determination of the fair value reflects numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding opentable and kayak expected growth rate and operating margin expected length and severity of the impact from the covid pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery the performance of the business during and following the covid pandemic well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of our control such discount rate and market comparables the evaluation required significant judgment and estimate and actual result could be materially different than those judgment and estimate utilized in the fair value estimate future event and changing market condition may lead to re evaluate the assumption reflected in the current forecast disclosed above particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the performance of the business during and following the covid pandemic which may result in need to recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation see note and to the consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the impairment charge in addition given the severe downturn in the global travel industry and the financial difficulty faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partner result of the covid pandemic we have increased our provision for expected credit loss on receivables from and cash advance made to our travel service provider and restaurant partner for the year ended december there wa million increase in expected credit loss expense compared to the same period in the prior year moreover due to the high level of cancellation of existing reservation we have incurred and may continue to incur higher than normal cash outlay to refund consumer for prepaid reservation in some instance we do not estimate recovery of prepayment already made to travel service provider where we have agreed to provide free cancellation to customer for non refundable reservation and this ha resulted in an aggregate reduction in revenue of million for the year ended december any additional significant increase in our provision for expected credit loss on receivables from and cash advance made to travel service provider and restaurant partner and any additional significant increase in cash outlay to refund consumer would have corresponding negative effect on our result of operation and related cash flow face risk associated with the restructuring of our business due to the impact of the covid pandemic on our business volume we took action to reduce the size of our workforce and there could be further reduction in the size of our workforce and or consolidation to optimize efficiency and reduce cost see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation trend for more information on the workforce reduction we have incurred and expect to incur charge related to the reduction in our workforce change in our facility requirement contract termination and other non cash charge and there could be unanticipated cost in the future implementation of these restructuring action present several significant risk including the potential negative impact on employee morale and productivity the loss of talented employee that we would not otherwise want to lose difficulty retaining valuable key employee that have not been terminated adverse impact on our culture diversion of attention away from operating our business public scrutiny personnel capacity constraint adverse effect on our internal control environment actual or perceived disruption of service to our customer and hampering of our ability to grow develop innovative product and compete any of which could adversely impact our business and reputation if we do not successfully manage the restructurings the anticipated efficiency and cost saving may be delayed or not realized risk associated with managing any restructurings effectively include unforeseen delay in the implementation of workforce reduction delay in completing required consultation with work council or other relevant organization or in obtaining any required approval regulatory impediment or litigation any of these risk associated with the implementation or management of the restructurings could adversely impact our business result of operation and or reputation decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent upon the sale of travel service travel including accommodation including hotel motel resort home apartment and other unique place to stay rental car and airline ticket reservation is significantly dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service decline during general economic downturn and recession and time of political or economic uncertainty such currently being experienced due to the covid pandemic consumer engage in le discretionary spending are concerned about unemployment or inflation have reduced access to credit or experience other concern or effect that reduce their ability or willingness to travel perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth high or rising unemployment rate inflation and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax or tariff increased interest rate and reduced government spending have impaired and could in the future impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand political uncertainty condition or event can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand in the past and prior to the significantly changed circumstance brought on by the onset of the covid pandemic we experienced volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in accommodation average daily rate adrs across many region of the world particularly in those country that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believed were due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern further economic or political disruption beyond those resulting from the covid pandemic could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition which in turn could negatively affect travel or the travel industry in general and therefore have an adverse impact on our result of operation while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in accommodation provider increasing their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for accommodation reservation transaction change proportionately with price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our accommodation reservation business and on our revenue and result of operation result of the covid pandemic and it material adverse impact on travel we have generally seen significant decrease in occupancy rate and adrs these and other macro economic uncertainty such oil price geopolitical tension and differing central bank monetary policy have led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior for example although lower oil price may lead to increased travel activity consumer could have more discretionary fund and airline fare decrease decline in oil price may be indicative of broader macro economic weakness which in turn could negatively affect the travel industry our business and result of operation conversely higher oil price may result in higher airfare and decreased travel activity which can negatively affect our business and result of operation result of the united kingdom leaving the european union brexit we anticipate that we will face new regulatory cost and challenge regulation and policy diverge from those of the european union or if additional business license are required since some of the detail of the united kingdom exit from the european union continue to unfold we are unable to predict all of the effect brexit will have on our business and result of operation the uncertainty of macro economic factor and their impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn could adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our business and adversely affect our result of operation in addition to the impact of the covid pandemic described earlier in these risk factor other event beyond our control such oil price stock market volatility terrorist attack changing unusual or extreme weather or natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood fire drought and volcanic eruption whether due to climate change or otherwise travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such coronaviruses ebola and zika political instability change in economic condition war and regional hostility imposition of tax tariff or surcharge by regulatory authority change in trade policy or trade dispute change in immigration policy or other travel restriction travel related accident or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel have previously and may in the future disrupt travel limit the ability or willingness of traveler to visit certain location or otherwise result in decline in travel demand and adversely affect our business and result of operation because these event or concern and the full impact of their effect are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service and our relationship with travel service provider and other partner any of which can adversely affect our business and result of operation intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete globally with both online and traditional travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive constantly evolving and subject to rapid change and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have significantly more customer or user consumer data and financial and other resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market and ha grown rapidly in this area including by offering flight meta search product google flight hotel meta search product google hotel ad vacation rental meta search product it book on google reservation functionality google travel planning tool that aggregate it flight hotel and package product in one website and by integrating it hotel meta search product and restaurant information and reservation product into it google map app in addition amazon ha experimented with online travel in the past and continues to experiment in this area such by partnering with travel company to offer it customer travel product including partnership with booking com to provide travel deal to amazon prime user in certain country moreover the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the covid pandemic the structure of the travel industry or consumer preference could change in way that could disadvantage and benefit certain of our existing competitor or new entrant for example result of the covid pandemic and the resulting international travel restriction and social distancing practice there ha been shift in favor of domestic travel and alternative accommodation this shift could benefit competitor that are more well established in domestic market and alternative accommodation than we are result our historical strength may not provide the competitive advantage that they did prior to the pandemic if we are unable to successfully adapt to any change in how the travel industry operates or to change in the way in which consumer purchase travel service our ability to compete and therefore our business and result of operation would be adversely affected we currently or may in the future compete with variety of company including online travel reservation service such expedia hotel com hotwire orbitz travelocity wotif cheaptickets ebookers and carrentals com which are owned by expedia group traveloka in which expedia group hold minority interest and despegar decolar in which expedia group hold minority interest trip com group in which we hold small minority interest trip com which is owned by trip com group tongcheng elong

resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic offer travel or travel related search meta search and or reservation booking service and may create additional inroad into online travel google travel meta search service google hotel ad and google flight have grown rapidly and have achieved significant market share in relatively short time meta search service leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the consumer specific itinerary across travel service provider accommodation rental car company or airline online travel company otcs and other online platform and in many instance compete directly with for customer meta search service intend to appeal to consumer by showing broader travel search result than may be available through otcs or other online platform which could lead to travel service provider or others gaining larger share of search traffic google leverage it general search business to promote it meta search offering by showing meta search result at the top of it organic search result further tripadvisor and trivago two other leading meta search company support their meta search service with significant marketing effort through our kayak meta search service we compete directly with these and other meta search service if we are unable to effectively compete with these company our business and result of operation could be harmed meta search service may evolve into more traditional otcs by offering consumer the ability to make travel reservation directly through their platform for example tripadvisor allows consumer to make reservation at some accommodation while staying on tripadvisor through it instant booking offering which includes participation by many of the leading global hotel chain google also provides reservation service through book on google to the extent we participate in any such offering provided by meta search service resulting reservation could be le profitable and could cannibalize business that would otherwise come directly to or through other more profitable channel if consumer book travel service through service such tripadvisor instant booking google book on google meta search website or directly with travel service provider after visiting meta search platform or using meta search utility on traditional search without using an otc like or if meta search service limit our participation within their search result or evolve into more traditional otcs we may need to increase our marketing or other customer acquisition cost to maintain or grow our reservation booking and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected over the year there ha been proliferation of new channel through which accommodation provider can offer reservation the market for travel service ha evolved for example company such airbnb and expedia group offer service providing alternative accommodation property owner particularly individual an online place to list their accommodation where traveler can search and book such property and compete directly with our alternative accommodation service in addition airbnb which owns hoteltonight offer some hotel reservation through it online platform company specializing in one type of travel service or product could expand their offering to compete with more broadly further meta search service may lower the cost for new company to enter the market by providing distribution channel without the cost of promoting the new entrant brand to drive consumer directly to it platform new travel related service are frequently being introduced to the market for example in google launched google travel which combine it hotel flight and package offering into one website with trip planning tool some of our competitor and potential competitor offer variety of online service such food delivery shopping gaming or search service many of which are used by consumer more frequently than online travel service result competitor or potential competitor that ha established other more frequent online interaction with consumer may be able to more easily or cost effectively acquire customer for it online travel service than we can for example some competitor or potential competitor with more frequent online interaction with consumer are seeking to create super apps where consumer can use many online service without leaving that company app in particular in market such asia where online activity including commerce is conducted primarily through apps on mobile device if any of these platform are successful in offering new travel related service or service similar to ours to consumer who would otherwise use our platform or if we are unable to offer our service to consumer within these super apps our customer acquisition effort could be le effective and our customer acquisition cost including our marketing expense could increase either of which would harm our business and result of operation although we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use consumer experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation result it is increasingly important to offer travel service such accommodation reservation at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program or otherwise discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share result in certain market we may need to provide discount or other incentive in order to be competitive which may make it difficult for to maintain or grow market share and to maintain historical profit margin these initiative may also result in lower adrs and lower revenue percentage of gross booking part of our strategy to provide more payment option to consumer and travel service provider booking com is increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment on behalf of customer this allows booking com to present consumer with more pricing option if we are unable to effectively offer competitive price our market share business and result of operation could be materially adversely affected travel service provider including hotel chain rental car company and airline with which we conduct business compete with in online channel to drive consumer to their own platform in lieu of third party distributor such travel service provider may charge lower price and in some instance offer advantage such loyalty point or special discount to member of closed user group such loyalty program participant or consumer with registered account any of which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than our service for example many large hotel chain have instituted additional initiative such increased discounting and incentive to encourage consumer to book accommodation directly through their online platform we also offer various incentive to consumer and may need to offer additional or increased advantage to maintain or grow our reservation booking which adversely impact our profit margin further consolidation among travel service provider such marriott international acquisition of starwood hotel resort in could result in lower rate of commission paid to otcs increased discounting and greater incentive for consumer to join closed user group such travel service provider expand their offering if we are not effective our competitor including hotel chain in offering discounted price and other incentive to consumer our ability to grow and compete and our result of operation could be harmed face risk related to the growth rate and the global expansion of our business we derive substantial portion of our revenue and have significant operation outside the united state our international business include our netherlands based otc brand booking com including rentalcars com based in the united kingdom our asia based otc brand agoda and to lesser extent kayak international meta search service and opentable international restaurant reservation service before the covid pandemic our international otc operation historically had achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking in particular with respect to their accommodation reservation service without taking into consideration the recent decline caused by the covid pandemic these growth rate which contributed significantly to our historical growth in consolidated revenue and earnings had generally declined over time the absolute level of our gross booking increased and online travel growth rate declined in addition to the general slowing growth rate of online travel and the effect of the covid pandemic other factor may also slow the growth rate of our international business including for example worldwide or regional economic condition strengthening of the dollar versus the euro the british pound sterling and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation adverse change in travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market any decline in the growth rate of our international business negatively impact our revenue and earnings growth rate and consequence our stock price our long term strategy involves continued expansion throughout the world many region have different economic condition custom language currency consumer expectation level of consumer acceptance and use of online platform for commerce legislation regulatory environment including labor law and custom tax law and level of political stability and we are subject to associated risk typical of international business international market may have strong local competitor with an established brand and travel service provider or restaurant relationship that may make expansion in that market difficult or costly and take more time than anticipated in addition compliance with legal regulatory or tax requirement in multiple jurisdiction place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence in some market such china legal and other regulatory requirement may prohibit or limit participation by foreign business such by making foreign ownership or management of internet or travel related business illegal or difficult or may make direct participation in those market uneconomic which could make our entry into and expansion in those market difficult or impossible require that we work with local partner or result in higher operating cost certain market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall profit margin these market increase in size over time if we are unsuccessful in expanding in new and existing market and effectively managing that expansion our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we intend to continue to improve the accommodation choice available for reservation on our platform however the growth rate of the number of accommodation on our platform may vary in part result of removing accommodation from our platform from time to time we have seen year over year increase in the number of accommodation removed from our platform during and resulting from the impact of the covid pandemic and we expect to see further accommodation removal in the future primarily due to property not providing availability on our platform non payment of invoice or property closure many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season weather or other factor or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner lower profit margin are associated with alternative accommodation property due to certain additional cost related to offering these accommodation on our platform we increase our alternative accommodation business these different characteristic negatively impact our profit margin and to the extent these property represent an increasing percentage of the property added to our platform we expect that our room night growth rate and property growth rate will continue to diverge over time since each such alternative accommodation property ha fewer booking opportunity result of the foregoing the percentage of alternative accommodation property increase the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease in addition our alternative accommodation reservation business grows we may incur increasing number of complaint related to non existent property or property that are significantly different than described in the listing well claim of liability based on event occurring at such property such robbery injury death and other similar event such complaint or claim could result in negative publicity and increased cost which could adversely affect our reputation business and result of operation further the regulatory environment related to some alternative accommodation such home and apartment is evolving and law regulation or property association rule could impose restriction or burden on these property owner and manager that limit or negatively affect their ability to rent their property some jurisdiction have adopted or are considering statute or ordinance that prohibit owner and manager from renting certain property for fewer stated number of consecutive day or for more than an aggregate total number of day per year or that require owner or manager to obtain license to rent their property in addition several jurisdiction have adopted or are considering adopting statute or ordinance requiring online platform that list certain alternative accommodation to obtain license to list such accommodation and or to comply with other restriction or requirement this dynamic regulatory environment requires to expend significant time and resource and could negatively impact the growth and or size of our alternative accommodation reservation business we believe that the number variety and quality of accommodation on our platform and the corresponding access to accommodation room night had been key driver of the growth of our accommodation reservation business prior to the covid pandemic the breadth of our accommodation booking typically made an attractive source of consumer demand for our accommodation provider and we believe it will continue to do so the travel industry recovers however after accommodation provider recover from the covid pandemic they may wish to limit the amount of business that flow through single distribution channel also certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including by restricting accommodation offering in city center or near popular tourist destination such by restricting construction of new hotel or the renting of home or apartment such restriction could also include limiting the number of tourist permitted to visit and stay near popular area during peak season or general matter result we may experience constraint on the number of listing or accommodation room night actually available to which could negatively impact our business growth rate and result of operation the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from approximately at december to approximately at december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by our international operation change in our workforce may make it more difficult to hire train retain motivate and manage the required employee historically our brand operated on largely independent basis and many of them focused on particular service or geography we look to develop the connected trip and pursue our other strategic objective we are increasing the collaboration cooperation and interdependency among our brand we manage this shift in addition to managing any change in our workforce whether due to organic growth growth through acquisition workforce reduction or restructurings we may find it difficult to maintain the beneficial aspect of our corporate culture at the brand company and throughout the organization whole in addition travel recovers from the covid pandemic any future expansion or shift increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and administrative legal tax internal control and financial reporting function our current and planned employee system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage growth and increased complexity especially we employ employee in multiple geographic location around the world and increase the number and variety of our product and payment system the implementation of new information technology payment enterprise resource planning erp or other system could be disruptive and or costly or we may experience difficulty successfully integrating new system into existing system or migrating to new system from existing system any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation we rely on marketing channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our platform and grow our business we believe that maintaining and strengthening our brand are important aspect of our effort to attract and retain customer we have invested considerable resource in the establishment and maintenance of our brand and we intend to continue to invest resource in marketing and other brand building effort to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brand when and to the extent we deem appropriate in particular the covid pandemic subsides and consumer begin to travel again effective marketing ha been an important factor in our growth and we believe it will continue to be important to our future success our marketing spend is influenced by the marketing spend of our competitor we seek to maintain and increase our brand recognition among consumer and to maintain and grow traffic to our platform through performance marketing channel we may not be able to successfully maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand and even if we are successful in our branding effort such effort may not be cost effective for instance increased marketing by otcs meta search service and travel service provider which we saw prior to the covid pandemic and would expect to see again the covid pandemic subsides make our marketing effort more expensive and le effective if we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness and acceptance of our brand in cost effective manner our business market share and result of operation would be materially adversely affected our marketing efficiency expressed marketing expense percentage of revenue is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign currency exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer and the extent to which consumer come directly to our website or mobile apps for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our marketing efficiency we use third party website including online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and marketing the primary mean of generating traffic to our website growth of some of these channel had slowed prior to the covid pandemic historically our marketing expense have increased significantly however we have experienced more moderate growth rate in recent year and since the covid pandemic our marketing expense have declined significantly year over year our marketing efficiency ha declined in recent year trend we expect to continue in the long term though the rate of decrease may fluctuate and there may be period of stable or increasing return on investment roi from time to time and we can not predict how our marketing efficiency will trend during the recovery from the covid pandemic further at time we may pursue strategy of increasing marketing roi which could negatively affect our gross booking and revenue growth rate when evaluating our performance marketing spend generally we consider several factor for each channel such the customer experience on the advertising platform the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from particular platform well other factor currently we have reduced our marketing spend significantly year over year and are generally limiting our performance marketing effort to address particular booking characteristic that are identified having high likelihood of conversion and low likelihood of cancellation under the current circumstance of the covid pandemic pursuing strategy of improving marketing roi along with factor such competitor action in the bidding environment the amount of marketing invested by these channel to generate demand and overall marketing platform traffic growth trend which have shown volatility and long term deceleration of growth rate may also impact growth rate for marketing channel under market condition excluding the impact of the covid pandemic any reduction in our marketing efficiency could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation whether through reduced revenue or revenue growth or through marketing expense increasing faster than revenue and thereby reducing margin and earnings growth we believe that number of factor could cause consumer to increase their shopping activity before making travel purchase increased shopping activity reduces our marketing efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in reservation through our platform and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid marketing channel than through direct channel further consumer may favor travel service offered by search or meta search company over otcs which could reduce traffic to our travel reservation platform increase consumer awareness of our competitor brand and platform increase our marketing and other customer acquisition cost and adversely affect our business margin and result of operation to the extent any such increased shopping behavior lead to growth in our kayak meta search business such growth may not result in sufficient increase in revenue from our kayak meta search business to offset any related decrease in revenue or increase in marketing and other customer acquisition cost experienced by our otc brand we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market change the market in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard consolidation frequent new service announcement introduction and enhancement and changing consumer demand and preference these characteristic are changing at an even greater pace otcs and travel service provider seek to address consumer need and preference resulting from the covid pandemic we may not be able to keep up with these rapid change in addition these market characteristic are heightened by the progress of technology adoption in various market including the continuing adoption of the internet and online commerce in certain geography and the emergence and growth of the use of smartphones tablet and other smart device including those with voice and artificial intelligence capability for mobile commerce transaction new development in other area such cloud computing could make entering our market easier for competitor due to lower upfront technology cost result our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing technology to adapt our service and online platform to evolving industry standard and local preference and to continually innovate and improve the performance feature and reliability of our service and online platform in response to competitive service offering and the evolving demand of the marketplace in particular it is increasingly important for to effectively offer our service on mobile device through mobile apps and mobile optimized website and to tailor our service to varying device and platform any failure by to successfully develop and achieve consumer adoption of our mobile platform would have material and adverse effect on our growth market share business and result of operation further to the extent mobile device or platform enable user to block advertising content our advertising revenue and our ability to market our brand and acquire new consumer may be negatively affected we believe that ease of use comprehensive functionality and the look and feel of our mobile platform are increasingly competitively critical consumer obtain more of their travel and restaurant service through mobile device and platform result we intend to continue to spend significant resource maintaining developing and enhancing our mobile platform and other technology and platform in the long term additionally our ability to achieve our long term strategy to build the connected trip depends on successfully integrating and developing new and evolving technology which is likely to require increased financial and personnel investment that could have an adverse impact on our result of operation until we achieve the expected return on these investment however these effort may not be successful in improving the travel experience or retaining and attracting new customer which would harm our business and result of operation further technical innovation often result in bug vulnerability and other system failure any such bug vulnerability or failure especially in connection significant technical implementation or change could result in lost business harm to our brand or reputation consumer complaint and other adverse consequence any of which could adversely affect our business and result of operation we believe that another critical component to our future success will be our ability to enhance our payment capability including by offering alternative payment solution to consumer even when those payment solution may not be accepted by the travel service provider or restaurant alternate payment provider such alipay paytm and wechat pay operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both consumer and merchant in many market particularly in asia where credit card are not readily available and or commerce is largely carried out through mobile device these and other emerging alternative payment method are the exclusive or preferred mean of payment for many consumer therefore if we are unable to offer consumer their preferred method of payment by integrating new or emerging payment method into our platform we may not be able to effectively offer our service to these consumer which would limit our growth opportunity in these market and our business and result of operation could be harmed furthermore in the future the competitive pressure to innovate could encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow our current and potential competitor range from large and established company to emerging start ups emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before we do some of our larger competitor or potential competitor have more resource or more established or varied relationship with consumer than we have and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee in addition the widespread adoption of new internet networking or telecommunication technology or other technological change including new device and service such amazon echo and alexa and google home and google assistant developing technology such artificial intelligence chatbot and virtual reality technology and the creation of super apps where consumer can use many online service without leaving particular app could require to incur substantial expenditure to modify or adapt our service or infrastructure to these new technology which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition any failure to implement or adapt to new technology in timely manner or at all could adversely affect our ability to compete increase our consumer acquisition cost or otherwise adversely affect our business and therefore adversely affect our brand market share and result of operation our business could be negatively affected by change in online search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement we use google to generate significant portion of the traffic to our platform and to lesser extent we use other search and meta search service to generate traffic to our platform principally through pay per click marketing campaign the pricing and operating dynamic on these search and meta search platform can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively for example google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of consumer search such that the placement of link to our platform can be negatively affected and our cost to improve or maintain our placement in search result can increase the european commission ha fined google significant amount for anti competitive behavior relating to it comparison shopping service and online search advertising service change by google in how it present travel search result including it promotion of it travel meta search service or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result whether result of court order investigation or other reason may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation in january google announced modification to it flight display model including that it would not be charging airline and otcs for sending referral from google flight result certain airline and otc partner have limited or eliminated their use of other meta search service and have demanded cost saving from their other meta search service further google may receive access to certain discounted fare not provided to meta search service that charge for referral these modification could adversely affect our meta search business profit margin and result of operation similarly change by our other search and meta search partner in how they present travel search result or the manner in which they conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform in addition decline or slowing growth in travel search traffic negatively impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our platform through performance marketing on general search platform which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition we purchase online traffic from number of other source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated our business market share and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on various third party channel marketing affiliate to distribute accommodation rental car and airline ticket reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of reservation made through or suffer deterioration in it search or meta search ranking due to change in search or meta search algorithm or otherwise our business market share and result of operation could be negatively affected consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such google and apple to compete directly with widespread adoption of mobile device such the iphone and android enabled smartphones coupled with the web browsing functionality and development of thousand of apps available on these device continues to drive substantial online traffic and commerce to mobile platform we have experienced significant shift of business both direct and indirect to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform some competitor offer last minute discount for mobile accommodation reservation the revenue earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay have lower adrs and are not made far in advance further given the device size and technical limitation of smartphones mobile consumer may not be willing to download multiple apps from multiple company providing similar service and instead prefer to use one or limited number of apps for their mobile travel and restaurant research and reservation activity result the consumer experience with mobile apps well brand recognition and loyalty continue to be increasingly important our mobile offering have received generally strong review and are driving material and increasing share of our business we believe that mobile booking present an opportunity for growth and are necessary to maintain and grow our business consumer increasingly turn to mobile device instead of personal computer result it is increasingly important for to develop and maintain effective mobile platform to provide consumer with an appealing easy to use mobile experience if we are unable to continue to rapidly innovate and create new user friendly and differentiated mobile offering and efficiently and effectively advertise and distribute on these platform or if our mobile offering are not used by consumer we could lose market share and our business future growth and result of operation could be adversely affected google android operating system is the leading smartphone operating system in the world result google ha the ability to leverage it android operating system to give it travel service competitive advantage either technically or with prominence on it google play app store or within it mobile search result further google is the leading internet search service and ha leveraged it search popularity to promote it travel service the european commission ha fined google significant amount and the justice department the doj ha sued google for breaching antitrust rule by imposing restriction on android device manufacturer and mobile network operator including by mandating the pre installation of google apps and limiting access to it google play app store the european commission decision requires google to end those practice or face penalty payment of up to of the average daily worldwide turnover of alphabet google parent company google ha appealed the european commission decision and refutes the doj claim and it is not yet clear how or whether these action will affect google business including it travel service apple the producer of among other thing the iphone and ipad obtained patent for itravel mobile app that would allow traveler to check in for travel reservation in addition apple iphone operating system includes wallet virtual wallet app that hold ticket boarding pass coupon and gift card and along with itravel may be indicative of apple intent to enter the travel reservation business in some capacity apple ha substantial market share in the smartphone market and control integration of offering including travel service into it mobile operating system apple also ha more experience producing and developing mobile apps and ha access to greater resource than we have apple may use or expand itravel wallet siri apple voice recognition concierge service apple pay apple mobile payment system or another mobile app or functionality mean of entering the online travel reservation marketplace to the extent google or apple use their mobile operating system app distribution channel or in the case of google search service to favor their own travel service offering our business and result of operation could be harmed we are dependent on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant we rely on provider of accommodation rental car and airline ticket and on restaurant to make their service available to consumer through our arrangement with travel service provider generally do not require them to make available any specific quantity of accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket or to make accommodation reservation rental car or airline ticket available in any geographic area for any particular route or at any particular price similarly our arrangement with restaurant generally do not require them to provide all of their available table and reservation to customer through we are in regular dialogue with our major travel service provider about the nature and extent of their participation in our service significant reduction on the part of any of our major travel service provider or provider that are particularly popular with consumer in their participation in our service for sustained period of time or complete withdrawal whether result of limitation on occupant capacity or business closure stemming from the covid pandemic or otherwise could have material adverse effect on our business market share and result of operation to the extent any of those major or popular travel service provider ceased to participate in our service in favor of one of our competitor service or decided to require consumer to purchase service directly from them our business market share and result of operation could be harmed during period of higher occupancy rate accommodation provider may decrease their distribution of accommodation reservation through third party intermediary like in particular through our discount service further consolidation among travel service provider increase the potential adverse effect of decision by any particular significant travel service provider such large hotel chain airline or rental car company to withdraw from or reduce it participation in our service also increase the covid pandemic ha increased the risk that our travel service provider and restaurant partner voluntarily or involuntarily declare bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit their operation which could harm our business and result of operation in particular the potential harm to our business and result of operation is greater if there are bankruptcy or closure of larger partner such airline hotel chain or large rental car company to the extent restaurant limit the availability of reservation through opentable or if significant number of restaurant cease to participate in our service whether result of the covid pandemic or otherwise or if government order restrict occupant capacity of any travel service provider or restaurant result of the covid pandemic consumer may not continue to use our service and or our revenue and result of operation could be adversely affected especially if reservation during highly desirable time on high volume day are not made available through kayak meta search service depends on access to information related to travel service pricing schedule availability and other related information from otcs and travel service provider to attract consumer many of kayak agreement with otcs and travel service provider are short term agreement that may be terminated on day notice to the extent otcs or travel service provider no longer provide such information to kayak kayak ability to provide comprehensive travel service information to consumer could be diminished and it brand business and result of operation could be harmed to the extent consumer do not view kayak reliable source of comprehensive travel service information fewer consumer would likely visit it website which would also likely have negative impact on kayak advertising revenue and result of operation in addition if otcs or travel service provider choose not to advertise with kayak or choose to reduce or eliminate the fee paid to kayak for referral from query result kayak business and result of operation could be adversely affected we rely on the performance of highly skilled employee and if we are unable to retain or motivate key employee or hire retain and motivate well qualified employee our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled employee for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of key senior management in the united state europe and asia are critical to the overall management of our business we may not be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business and competitive position we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense our international success in particular ha led to increased effort by our competitor and others to hire our international employee these difficulty may be amplified by evolving restriction on immigration travel or availability of visa or work permit for skilled technology worker further result of the covid pandemic the potential for long recovery period for the travel industry and our workforce reduction and restructurings employee may not view employment with positively they did prior to the pandemic all of which make attraction and retention of well qualified employee more difficult the competition for talent in our industry ha in the past and may in the future increase our personnel expense which may adversely affect our result of operation our continued ability to compete effectively and to innovate and develop product service technology and enhancement depends on our ability to attract retain and motivate well qualified employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining training managing and motivating existing employee our business competitive position reputation and result of operation would be adversely affected investment in new business strategy and acquisition could disrupt our ongoing business and present risk not originally contemplated our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world result our strategy involves evaluating and potentially entering complementary business in furtherance of that mission we have invested and in the future may invest in new business strategy and acquisition for example we acquired fareharbor in april to increase our ability to offer local activity and experience such tour and attraction we also have acquired and in the future may acquire similar to those we already operate in an effort to expand our geographic market acquire technology or product or to otherwise improve or grow our business for example in july we acquired the momondo group and in november we acquired hotelscombined in each case among other thing to enhance the global reach of our meta search service such endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including diversion of management attention from current operation greater than expected liability and expense inadequate return on capital new risk with which we are not familiar legal compliance obligation that previously did not apply to integration risk and difficulty and unidentified issue not discovered in our investigation and evaluation of those strategy and acquisition result entering new business involves risk and cost that could if realized have an adverse effect on our business reputation result of operation profit margin cash flow or financial condition well on our ability to achieve the expected benefit of any such investment or acquisition we may decide to make minority investment including through joint venture in which we have limited or no management or operational control the controlling person in such case may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and decision of the company or venture in which we invested may result in harm to our reputation or business or adversely affect the value of our investment substantial portion of our goodwill and intangible asset were acquired in acquisition if we determine that any of our goodwill and intangible asset or any goodwill or intangible asset acquired in future transaction experience decline in value we may be required to record we did in the first and third quarter of an impairment see note to our consolidated financial statement which could materially adversely affect our result of operation further we may issue share of our common stock in these

been managed independently integrated certain function across business and restructured or ceased operating certain asset or business and we may do so in the future including through divestiture these integration may be of varying degree depending on many factor such business compatibility strategic goal or geographic location among others integration are complex often involve additional or unexpected cost and create variety of issue and risk including disruption or harm to the business involved disruption to our other business including result of the need for management to spend time and attention on the integration difficulty combining different company culture system reporting structure title and job description and compensation scheme problem retaining key personnel in particular at the acquired or integrated company loss of travel service provider restaurant or partner of the acquired business and difficulty implementing and maintaining effective control procedure

organization are increasing in frequency and sophistication and are constantly evolving cyberattacks on organization have increased during the crisis of the covid pandemic any security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or third system could significantly harm our reputation and therefore our business brand market share and result of operation consumer who use certain of our service provide with their credit card information we require user name and password in order to access our information technology system we also use encryption and authentication technology to secure the transmission and storage of data and prevent unauthorized access to our data or account computer circumvention capability new discovery or advance or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of consumer data for example third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee travel service provider partner or consumer to disclose user name password or other sensitive information phishing which may in turn be used to access our information technology system or to defraud our partner or consumer third party may also attempt to take over consumer account by using password usernames and other personal information obtained elsewhere to attempt to unlawfully access consumer account on our platform we have experienced targeted and organized phishing and account takeover attack which have increased during the covid pandemic and we expect to continue to experience these event in the future these risk are likely to increase we expand our offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information our effort to protect information from unauthorized access may be unsuccessful or may result in the rejection of legitimate attempt to book reservation through our service any of which could result in lost business and could materially and adversely affect our business reputation and result of operation our existing technical administrative and physical security measure may not be successful in preventing security breach party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal consumer information or transaction data or other proprietary information result of increased number of employee exit due to the restructuring action or otherwise we face heightened risk related to the loss or unauthorized use of or access to our system intellectual property or other protected data in the last few year several major company experienced high profile security breach that exposed their system and information and or their consumer or employee personal information and it is expected that these type of event will continue to occur we have heightened risk of security breach due to some of our operation being located in certain international jurisdiction we expend significant resource to protect against security breach and regularly increase our security related expenditure to maintain or increase our system security we have experienced and responded to cyberattacks which we believe have not had significant impact on the integrity of our system or the security of data including personal information maintained by these issue are likely to become more difficult to manage we expand the number of place where we operate and the number and variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack increasingly become more sophisticated security breach could result in severe damage to our information technology infrastructure including damage that could impair our ability to offer our service or the ability of consumer to make reservation or conduct search through

affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could negatively affect consumer willingness to provide private information or effect online commercial transaction generally including through our service some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system additionally our consumer personal data could be affected by security breach at third party upon which we rely such travel service provider connectivity partner payroll provider health plan provider payment processor or gd security breach at any such third party marketing affiliate travel service provider payment processor gd or other third party on which we rely such the security breach experienced by mgm resort international in could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and in any event could result in negative publicity subject to notification requirement damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement or with parameter within which we permit them to process data which could expose to liability in the operation of our business we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data and payment information this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world the european union general data protection regulation the gdpr imposes significant compliance obligation and cost for under the gdpr violation could result in fine of up to million euro or up to of the annual global revenue of the infringer whichever is greater several data protection authority have imposed significant fine on company of various size across industry sector for violation of the gdpr the california consumer privacy act the ccpa became operative in and the recently enacted california privacy right act which is set to become operative in january impose new privacy requirement and right for consumer in california and ha resulted and will continue to result in additional complexity and cost related to compliance many other jurisdiction continue to consider adopting or may adopt similar data protection regulation these regulation are typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction well to give individual greater right and or control over how their data is processed in many case these law apply not only to third party transaction but also to transfer of information between and our subsidiary including employee information these law and their interpretation continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction for example the recent invalidation of the eu privacy shield ha altered one of the acceptable approach upon which many company have relied to ensure compliant data transfer between the european union and the united state additionally some of these regulation such the ccpa give consumer private right of action against company for violation of these rule while we have invested and continue to invest significant resource to comply with the gdpr ccpa and other privacy regulation many of these regulation are new extremely complex and subject to interpretation non compliance with these law could result in negative publicity damage to our reputation significant penalty or other legal liability if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business our result of operation financial condition or competitive position could be adversely affected system capacity constraint system failure or denial of service or other attack could harm our business and our reputation prior to the covid pandemic we experienced rapid growth in consumer traffic to our online platform the number of accommodation on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation once consumer begin to travel again if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fail to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our result of operation further an online business we are dependent on the internet and maintaining connectivity between and consumer source of internet traffic such google and our travel service provider and restaurant consumer increasingly turn to mobile and other smart device we also become dependent on consumer access to the internet through mobile carrier and their system disruption in internet access whether generally in specific market or otherwise especially if widespread or prolonged could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may occur our computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error computer virus flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism terrorism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand result in lost business or result in consumer choosing to use competitive service any of which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our existing security measure may not be successful in preventing attack on our system and any such attack could cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time there are numerous other potential form of attack such phishing ransomware account takeover attack sql injection where third party attempt to insert malicious code into our software through data entry field in our website in order to gain control of the system and attempting to use our website platform to launch denial of service attack on another party each of which could cause significant interruption in our operation and potentially adversely affect the value of our brand operation and result of operation or involve in legal or regulatory proceeding we expend significant resource in an attempt to prepare for and mitigate the effect of any such attack reduction in the availability and response time of our online service could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such attack on our system and measure we may take to divert suspect traffic in the event of such an attack could result in the diversion of bona fide customer these issue are more difficult to manage during any expansion of the number of place where we operate and the variety of service we offer and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced successful attack could result in negative publicity damage our reputation and prevent consumer from booking travel service researching travel service or making restaurant reservation through during the attack any of which could cause consumer to use the service of our competitor which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our market share business and result of operation rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including gd and computerized central reservation system of the accommodation rental car and airline industry in connection with providing some of our service any damage to breach of or interruption in these third party service and system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking related accommodation rental car and airline reservation and have material adverse effect on our business brand and result of operation our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation further result of the covid pandemic some of our third party service provider may go out of business suspend operation reduce their support service or system maintenance activity any of which could adversely affect our business and reputation we depend upon various third party to process payment including credit card for our merchant transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised or ceased or suspended operation whether due to the covid pandemic or otherwise our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant transaction and related revenue until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor and this could have negative effect on our business reputation and result of operation and in certain case of the insolvency of such partner could result in additional payment by and loss of the total transaction value which would negatively affect our result of operation and financial condition we do not have completely formalized or comprehensive disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of consumer question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support employee any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that could be substantial increase customer service cost harm our reputation and result in some consumer switching to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently and significantly harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial and accounting system if the number of consumer using our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we may need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system or other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair many of our process and system including those related to processing and recording revenue are highly automated and involve multiple input from various it system which can mitigate the risk of human error but which can also make testing troubleshooting and auditing more difficult result it may be difficult to quickly detect and correct error embedded in these process or system legal tax regulatory compliance and reputational riskswe may have exposure to additional tax liability an international business providing reservation and marketing service around the world we are subject to income tax and non income based tax in the united state and various international jurisdiction due to economic and political condition tax rate and tax regime in various jurisdiction may be subject to significant change our future effective tax rate could be affected by change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset or change in tax law or their interpretation if our effective tax rate were to increase our result of operation and cash flow would be adversely affected although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable and comply with applicable law we regularly review our tax filing position especially in light of tax law or business practice change and we may change our position or determine that previous position should be amended either of which could result in additional tax liability the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and to date we have been audited in many taxing jurisdiction with no significant impact on our result of operation if current or future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow for example booking com is the subject of tax proceeding in france and ha been assessed approximately million euro the majority of which represents penalty and interest in january we were required to pay the assessment for the year through million euro in order to preserve our right to contest the assessment for that period in court though the payment is not an admission that we owe the tax although we believe that booking com ha been and continues to be in compliance with french tax law and we are contesting the assessment during the third quarter of we contacted the french tax authority regarding the potential to achieve resolution of the matter through settlement see note to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding the french tax matter and certain tax contingency in general government are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue which ha contributed to an increase in audit activity more aggressive position taken by tax authority more time and difficulty to resolve any audit or dispute and an increase in new tax legislation any such additional tax or other assessment may be in excess of our current tax provision or may require to modify our business practice in order to reduce our exposure to additional tax going forward any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition in december the tax cut and job act the tax act wa enacted into law in the united state the tax act introduced tax on of global intangible low taxed income gilti which is income determined to be in excess of specified routine rate of return on qualifying business asset the tax act further introduced base erosion and anti abuse tax beat aimed at preventing the erosion of the tax base and new tax deduction with respect to certain foreign derived intangible income if we are unable to operate our business so that beat doe not impact our effective tax rate result of operation and cash flow would be adversely affected the interpretation and implementation of the tax act and regulation rule or guidance that have been or may be adopted under or result from the tax act have had and could have negative impact on our result of operation and cash flow during the presidential campaign then presidential candidate joseph biden proposed making significant corporate income tax change including raising the corporate income tax rate to and increasing the percentage of gilti subject to tax in the united state to increase in the corporate income tax rate or increasing the percentage of gilti subject to tax in the united state could have negative impact on our result of operation and cash flow additionally there have been significant change made and proposed to international tax law that increase the complexity burden and cost of tax compliance the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd initiated the base erosion and profit shifting beps project to ensure international tax standard keep pace with change in global business practice and to address situation where multinational business may pay little or no tax in certain jurisdiction by shifting profit away from jurisdiction in which the profit generating activity take place the oecd is working towards consensus based solution by the middle of to address the challenge posed to the current tax system by the digitalization of the economy the oecd secretariat current proposal aim to ensure that multinational business are taxed in jurisdiction where they are conducting significant business but do not have physical presence by establishing new nexus rule determining where tax should be paid and new profit allocation rule determining what portion of profit should be taxed certain country have taken step to unilaterally introduce digital service tax to address the issue of multinational business carrying on business in their jurisdiction without physical presence and therefore generally not subject to income tax in those jurisdiction these digital service tax are calculated percentage of revenue rather than income or profit result with the exception of the digital service tax these tax apply even in situation where the business may be operating at an overall loss in most case since these digital service tax are based on revenue and not income they can not be credited against tax paid on income in another jurisdiction for the same revenue the interpretation and implementation of the various digital service tax especially if there is inconsistency in the application of these tax across tax jurisdiction could have materially adverse impact on our result of operation and cash flow further digital service tax may not apply to our competitor such hotel chain and smaller otcs which harm our business and competitive position any change to international tax law including new definition of permanent establishment new nexus and profit allocation rule or change affecting the benefit of preferential tax regime such the dutch innovation box tax discussed below could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate further change to tax law and additional reporting requirement could increase the complexity burden and cost of compliance due to the large scale of our international business activity any change in or international taxation of our activity or the combined effect of tax law in multiple jurisdiction may increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the complexity and cost associated with tax compliance especially if change are implemented or interpreted inconsistently across tax jurisdiction and adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation are also subject to other non income based tax such value added payroll sale use excise net worth property hotel occupancy and good and service tax we refer generally to tax on travel transaction value added tax sale tax excise tax hotel occupancy tax etc travel transaction tax from time to time we are under audit or investigation by tax authority or involved in legal proceeding related to these non income based tax or we may revise or amend our tax position which may result in additional non income based tax liability number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against otcs including related to among other thing the payment of certain travel transaction tax such hotel occupancy tax that could include historical tax that are claimed to be owed interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost in addition number of jurisdiction have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of travel transaction tax additional jurisdiction may assert that we are subject to among other thing travel transaction tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively prospectively or both jurisdiction could also seek to amend their tax statute in order to collect travel transaction tax from on prospective basis litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding additionally number of jurisdiction have adopted or may adopt law that require to collect and remit sale tax on behalf of travel service provider which in some instance may negatively impact our revenue adverse tax decision or new law could have material adverse effect on our business margin cash flow and result of operation an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost we may not be able to maintain our innovation box tax benefit the netherlands corporate income tax law provides that income generated from qualifying innovative activity is taxed at the rate of prior to and beginning in january innovation box tax rather than the dutch statutory rate of portion of booking com earnings historically ha qualified for innovation box tax treatment in the innovation box tax benefit reduced our consolidated income tax expense by million in order to be eligible for innovation box tax treatment booking com must among other thing apply for and obtain research and development certificate from dutch governmental agency every six month confirming that the activity that booking com intends to be engaged in over the subsequent six month period are innovative the certificate is current but should booking com fail to secure such certificate in any future period for example because the governmental agency doe not view booking com new or anticipated activity innovative or should this agency determine that the activity performed in prior period were not performed contemplated or did not comply with the agency requirement booking com may lose it certificate and result the innovation box tax benefit may be reduced or eliminated booking com intends to apply for continued innovation box tax treatment for future period however booking com application may not be accepted or if accepted the amount of qualifying earnings may be reduced the loss of the innovation box tax benefit or any material portion thereof whether due to change in tax law or determination by the dutch government that booking com activity are not innovative or for any other reason could substantially increase our effective tax rate and adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow in the future our business is subject to various competition anti trust consumer protection and online commerce law rule and regulation around the world and the size of our business grows scrutiny of our business by legislator and regulator in these area may intensify we the travel industry and the technology industry generally are subject to competition anti trust and consumer protection law and regulation around the world these law and regulation evolve and change and their interpretation application and enforcement can also change be unpredictable or be affected by changing political or social pressure we expand our business into new area including our evolution towards the connected trip we may become subject to additional law and regulation at time online travel platform including have been the subject of investigation or inquiry by various national competition authority ncas or other governmental authority for example we have been and continue to be involved in investigation related to whether booking com contractual parity arrangement with accommodation provider sometimes also referred to most favored nation or mfn provision are anti competitive because they require accommodation provider to provide booking com with room rate condition or availability that are at least favorable those offered to other otcs or through the accommodation provider website to resolve and close certain of the investigation we have from time to time made commitment to the investigating authority regarding future business practice or activity for example booking com ha made commitment to several ncas including agreeing to narrow the scope of it parity arrangement in order to resolve parity related investigation in august booking com voluntarily extended it commitment in the european union for another three year additionally these type of investigation can result and have resulted in the assessment of fine we have also been involved in investigation or inquiry involving consumer protection matter for example the united kingdom nca the competition and market authority or cma launched consumer protection law investigation into the clarity accuracy and presentation of information on hotel booking site in connection with this investigation in booking com agoda and kayak along with number of other otcs voluntarily agreed to certain commitment with the cma which resolved the cma investigation without finding by the cma of an infringement or an admission of wrongdoing by the otcs involved among other thing the commitment provided to the cma include showing price inclusive of all mandatory tax and charge providing information about the effect of money earned on search result ranking on or before the search result page and making certain adjustment to how discount and statement concerning popularity or availability are shown to consumer the cma ha stated that it expects all market participant to adhere to the same standard regardless of whether they formally signed the commitment result of additional inquiry from other ncas in the european union booking com ha made similar commitment with the consumer protection cooperation network that became applicable in the european union in june there are consumer protection investigation or inquiry in other country well including in brazil and other country may decide to investigate these or similar issue generally or with respect to specific business including ours and we are unable to predict the outcome of any such other investigation or inquiry to the extent that any such other investigation or inquiry result in additional commitment fine damage or other remedy our business financial condition and result of operation could be harmed in light of the covid pandemic certain travel service provider partner and consumer have issued complaint with ncas to dispute our handling of force majeure provision in our contract with accommodation partner result ncas could decide to investigate our handling of force majeure provision and if any nca concludes the invocation of force majeure wa inappropriate there could be fine or other adverse impact market evolve and ncas or other governmental authority continue to monitor our industry new investigation of the industry generally or of specifically could and have occurred including revisiting issue that were the subject of prior investigation for example in july the european commission announced that it will study the marketing and sale of hotel accommodation in six country in also while we believe that we are complying with our commitment investigating authority or third party may determine that we are not complying with the commitment we have made and decide to pursue legal action to compel compliance or seek other remedy further in september the swiss price surveillance office opened an investigation into the level of commission of booking com in switzerland and the investigation is ongoing if there is an adverse outcome and booking com is unsuccessful in any appeal booking com could be required to reduce it commission in switzerland we are cooperating with regulator where applicable but we are unable to predict what if any effect any investigation or resolution thereof including the effect of any commitment we might make will have on our business industry practice or online commerce more generally to the extent that regulatory authority impose fine on or require change to our business practice or to those currently common to the industry our business competitive position and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected negative publicity regarding competition and or consumer law investigation could adversely affect our brand and therefore our business market share and result of operation competition and consumer law related investigation legislation or issue have and could in the future result in private litigation another area of regulatory inquiry involves contractual search term bidding restriction where one contracting party agrees not to bid on certain key search term related to the other party such other party name although we are generally moving away from these type of agreement in some of our contract we or the other party have agreed to bidding restriction if bidding restriction are held to be illegal or otherwise unenforceable or if we remove them from all of our contract our performance marketing cost may increase if bidding on affected key word especially those related to becomes more expensive which could adversely affect our performance marketing efficiency business and result of operation there is significant legislative and public focus on the technology industry especially technology company become larger in some instance country have passed legislation that go further to restrict business activity than action taken by ncas or other regulatory authority for example france italy belgium and austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clause in their entirety additionally the eu platform to business regulation regulates the relationship between online platform such booking com and european business user of online platform this new regulation requires online platform to provide additional disclosure to european business partner such term related to result ranking and preferential pricing well provide for mediation process to handle any dispute among other change in december the european commission proposed the digital market act and the digital service act which are expected to give regulator more instrument to investigate digital business and impose new rule on certain digital platform if they are determined to be gatekeeper the proposed legislation is not final and it is not known what the law will look like in their final form if adopted if the regulator were to determine that we are gatekeeper under the proposed legislation we could be subject to additional rule and regulation not applicable to all our competitor and our business could be harmed for example the rule applicable to gatekeeper could prohibit single sign in for different product and create new data sharing requirement and limitation on the use of data from third party new law and regulation and changing public perception relating to the technology industry could impact our service require to change our business practice or otherwise cause to incur additional operating cost to comply with or address these development further market condition change result of investigation litigation legislation or political or social pressure we may decide to voluntarily modify our business practice beyond what is required the full effect of which may not be known when making the decision but which could harm our competitive position and adversely affect our business and result of operation with additional attention on the size of travel or technology company generally our size and market share may negatively affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval of proposed acquisition our ability to expand into complementary business or our latitude in dealing with travel service provider such by limiting our ability to provide discount rebate or incentive or to exercise contractual right any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete regulatory and legal requirement and uncertainty could subject to business constraint increased compliance cost and complexity or otherwise harm our business our ability to provide our service and any future service is and will continue to be affected by legal regulation including law ordinance rule licensing requirement and other requirement and regulation of national and local government and regulatory authority around the world many of which are evolving and subject to the possibility of new or revised interpretation for example we offer optional rental car related insurance product to customer protecting them against accidental damage to their rental vehicle which subject to certain insurance regulation and related increased compliance cost and complexity any of which could negatively impact our business and result of operation law in some country relating to data localization registration travel agent and other local requirement could if applicable to adversely affect our ability to conduct business in those country any increase in the number or complexity of the law and regulation applicable to and our business could increase our compliance cost and burden and negatively affect our business and result of operation for example in the european union the package travel directive the package directive set out broad requirement such local registration certain mandatory financial guarantee disclosure requirement and other rule regulating the provision of travel package and linked travel arrangement the package directive also creates additional liability for provider of travel package which could be the otc for performance of the travel service within packaged trip under certain circumstance some part of our business are already subject to the broad scope of the package directive and our offering continue to diversify and expand we may become subject to additional requirement of the package directive compliance with this directive could be costly and complex or result of these requirement we could choose to limit offering that would otherwise be beneficial for the business any of which could adversely affect our business result of operation or ability to grow and compete the implementation of unfavorable regulation or unfavorable interpretation of existing regulation by judicial or regulatory body could require to incur significant compliance cost cause the development of the affected market to become impractical and otherwise have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation for example in connection with lawsuit begun in by the association of turkish travel agency turkish court ordered in that booking com must meet certain registration requirement in order to offer turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident if booking com doe not successfully appeal this decision or meet the turkish registration requirement booking com will be unable to resume offering turkish hotel and accommodation to turkish resident which would continue to negatively impact our result of operation another example is that the government announced in may that it will no longer suspend the right of private party to bring litigation under title iii of the cuban liberty and solidarity libertad act of popularly known the helm burton act allowing certain individual whose property wa confiscated by the cuban government beginning in to sue anyone who traffic in the property in question in court we are defendant in number of these lawsuit which seek remedy including the value of the expropriated property generally the applicable hotel plus interest treble damage attorney fee and cost we believe that we have meritorious defense to existing and potential claim and that the result of any related litigation will not be material to our business financial condition or result of operation however litigation is uncertain and there is little judicial history or interpretation of the relevant and defense in particular applied to business like ours result there can be no assurance that there will not be an adverse outcome to any such litigation or that such an outcome would not result in an adverse impact on our business financial condition or result of operation certain jurisdiction particularly in europe are considering regulation intended to address the issue of overtourism including restriction that may adversely affect our ability to offer accommodation in particular alternative accommodation near city center or popular tourist destination to the extent any such regulation require online platform such ours to comply with additional restriction related to offering reservation for accommodation tour and activity or other travel service in such area we could be subject to increased legal and compliance cost and our business growth and result of operation could be adversely affected compliance with the law and regulation of multiple jurisdiction increase our cost of doing business example of these law and regulation which vary and sometimes conflict include the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and local law which also prohibit corrupt payment to governmental official or third party data privacy requirement labor relation law non discrimination human right or anti human trafficking law and regulation such the modern slavery act tax law anti trust or competition law or sanctioned country or sanctioned person mandate and consumer protection law violation of these law and regulation could result in fine penalty and or criminal sanction against our officer or our employee and or prohibition on the conduct of our business any such violation could also result in prohibition on our ability to offer our service in one or more country delay or prevent potential acquisition and materially damage our reputation our brand our global expansion effort our ability to attract and retain employee and business partner our business and our operating result even if we comply with these law and regulation doing business in certain jurisdiction or violation of these law and regulation by the accommodation restaurant travel service provider or other party with whom we conduct business could harm our reputation and brand which could adversely affect our result of operation or stock price in addition these restriction may provide competitive advantage to our competitor unless they are also subject to comparable restriction our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty we are also subject to variety of other regulatory legal and public policy risk and challenge in managing an organization operating in various country including those related to regulatory change or other government action additional complexity to comply with regulation in multiple jurisdiction well overlapping or inconsistent legal regime in particular with respect to tax labor consumer protection digital content advertising promotion privacy and anti trust law difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country and change in social or political condition or policy relating to wide range of sustainability topic prior to the covid pandemic our business had grown substantially over the last several year we expanded into new geography and added new service in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate access to travel service across our various brand these change add complexity to legal and tax compliance and our internal control and our size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to regulatory scrutiny or audit by tax authority in various jurisdiction in addition by virtue of booking com size and presence in the netherlands it is required to have supervisory board to oversee the strategy and operation of booking com while the existence of the supervisory board ha not had significant impact on our operation under certain circumstance this governance structure could require booking com to obtain supervisory board approval in order to take certain action which could result in delay or other unanticipated strategic or operational challenge there are various risk associated with the facilitation of payment from consumer including risk related to fraud compliance with evolving rule and regulation and reliance on third party our result have been and will likely continue to be negatively impacted by consumer purchase made using fraudulent credit card claim the consumer did not authorize the purchase or consumer who have closed bank account or have insufficient fund in their bank account to satisfy payment we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our platform or in connection with other fraudulent transaction on our platform well other payment dispute with consumer accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting chargebacks we must also continually implement and evolve measure to detect and reduce the risk of fraud in particular these method become increasingly if we are unable to successfully combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our platform our business profit margin result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we believe that an important component of our future success will be our ability to offer consumer their preferred method of payment in the most efficient manner on all our platform and result we are processing more of our transaction on merchant basis where we facilitate payment from traveler through the use of credit card and other payment method such paypal alipay paytm and wechat pay while processing transaction on merchant basis allows to process transaction for property that do not otherwise accept credit card and to increase our ability to offer variety of payment method and flexible transaction term to consumer we incur additional payment processing cost which are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and other cost related to these transaction such cost related to fraudulent payment and transaction and fraud detection we expand our payment service to consumer and business partner in addition to the revenue from these transaction we may experience significant increase in these cost and our result of operation and profit margin could be materially adversely affected in particular if we experience significant increase in non variable cost related to fraudulent payment and transaction greater percentage of our transaction involve processing payment our global system and process must be managed on larger scale which add complexity administrative burden and cost and increase the demand on our system and control which could adversely affect our result of operation in addition our payment processing activity continue to develop we expect to be subject to additional regulation including financial service regulation which we expect to result in increased compliance cost and complexity including those associated with the implementation of new or advanced internal control for example the payment service directive ha further complicated the authentication process for accepting credit card result of this directive payment made on our platform by consumer in the european economic area are subject to strong customer authentication which requires the consumer to engage in additional step to authenticate their transaction this new requirement could cause consumer transaction to take longer to process or otherwise inconvenience the consumer which could result in consumer choosing not to utilize our platform often or at all the implementation of this process ha resulted and may continue to result in increased compliance cost and administrative burden for other new or expanded regulation that could apply to our payment activity evolve include those relating to money transmission license anti money laundering card scheme association sanction banking privacy and security of our process among others compliance with this changing regulatory environment creates significant additional compliance cost and burden or it could lead to modify our business plan or operation any of which could negatively impact our business result of operation and profit margin we are also subject to payment card association rule and obligation under our contract with the card scheme and our payment card processor including the payment card industry data security standard the standard under the standard and these association rule and obligation if information is compromised we could be liable to payment card issuer for associated expense and penalty and in some case we could be restricted in our ability to accept payment card under certain circumstance in our agreement with the card scheme and in relation to the standard we are also subject to periodic audit self assessment and other assessment of our compliance with the rule and obligation of the payment card association and the standard which could result in additional expense and administrative burden in addition if we fail to follow payment card industry security standard even if no consumer information is compromised we could incur significant fine or experience significant increase in payment card transaction cost additionally compliance with the standard may not prevent all security incident if we are fined or required to pay additional processing fee or if our ability to accept payment card is restricted in any way result of our failure to comply with these payment card industry rule or otherwise it could adversely impact our business result of operation and profit margin we rely on bank card scheme and other payment processor to execute certain component of the payment process we generally pay these third party interchange fee and other processing and gateway fee to help facilitate payment from consumer to travel service provider result if we are unable to maintain our relationship with these third party on favorable term or if these fee are increased for any reason our profit margin business and result of operation could be harmed additionally if these third party experience service disruption or if they cease operation whether result of the covid pandemic or otherwise consumer and travel service provider could have difficulty making or receiving payment which could adversely impact our reputation business and result of operation in addition in the event that one of our major travel service provider voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy or otherwise cease or limit operation we could experience an increase in chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such travel service provider and we could experience financial loss from certain prepayment made to such travel service provider if we are not able to recover the prepayment the covid pandemic and it resulting impact on travel demand the travel industry and the economy increase the risk of insolvency or disruption to the ability of our travel service provider to provide service and in some case ha already resulted in the insolvency or closure of travel service result if one of our major travel service provider declares bankruptcy or cease or limit operation or if many travel service provider declare bankruptcy or cease or limit operation it could adversely impact our business and result of operation we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on domain name trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee travel service provider partner and others to protect our proprietary right we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property in the united state and other jurisdiction and we currently hold number of issued patent in several jurisdiction further in the future we may acquire additional patent or patent portfolio which could require significant cash expenditure however we may choose not to patent or otherwise register some of our intellectual property and instead rely on trade secret or other mean of protecting our intellectual property we have licensed in the past and may license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party and these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation we also have procured various intellectual property license from third party in addition effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online particularly in certain jurisdiction in which we operate in which theft of intellectual property may be more prevalent we may be required to expend significant time and resource to prevent infringement or to enforce our intellectual property right we believe that our intellectual property right help to protect our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and may divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective we may not be able to successfully defend our intellectual property right or they may not be sufficient to effectively protect our business which could materially adversely affect our business brand and result of operation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business or require to change business practice or develop non infringing intellectual property which could require significant effort and expense in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our use of open source software could adversely affect our ability to protect our proprietary software and subject to possible litigation we use open source software in connection with our software development from time to time company that use open source software have faced claim challenging the use of open source software and or compliance with open source license term we could be subject to suit by party claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non compliance with open source licensing term some open source license require user who distribute software containing open source to make available all or part of such software which in some circumstance could include valuable proprietary code of the user while we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in manner that would require to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the term of an open source agreement such use could inadvertently occur in part because open source license term are often ambiguous any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damage for breach of contract could be harmful to our business result of operation or financial condition and could help our competitor develop service that are similar to or better than ours cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business cookie is text file that is stored on user computer or mobile device cooky are common tool used by thousand of website and mobile apps including ours to among other thing store or gather information remember log on detail so user doe not have to re enter them when revisiting website or opening an app market to consumer and enhance the user experience cooky are valuable tool for platform like ours to improve the customer experience and increase conversion many jurisdiction including the european union and more recently california have adopted regulation governing the use of cooky to the extent any such regulation require opt in consent before certain cooky can be placed on user computer or mobile device our ability to serve certain customer in the manner we currently do might be affected and our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our platform might be impaired either of which could negatively affect consumer experience using our service and our business market share and result of operation further any failure to comply with such regulation could result in fine and harm to our reputation financial risksour liquidity credit rating and ongoing access to capital could be materially and negatively affected by the impact of the covid pandemic our continued access to source of liquidity depends on multiple factor including global economic condition the condition of global financial market the availability of sufficient amount of financing our ability to meet debt covenant requirement our operating performance and our credit rating since the covid pandemic there ha been increased volatility in the financial and security market which ha generally made access to capital le certain and increased the cost of obtaining new capital further if our credit rating were to be downgraded or if financing source were to ascribe higher risk to our rating level our industry or our access to capital and the cost of any financing would be negatively impacted we currently have billion available under our revolving credit facility which provides an additional potential source of liquidity the revolving credit facility contains maximum leverage ratio covenant compliance with which is condition to our ability to borrow thereunder in april we amended the revolving credit facility pursuant to which the maximum leverage ratio covenant wa suspended through and including the three month ending march and ha been replaced with billion minimum liquidity covenant based on unrestricted cash cash equivalent short term investment and unused capacity under this revolving credit facility at december we were in compliance with the minimum liquidity covenant in october we amended the revolving credit facility to extend the suspension of the maximum leverage ratio covenant and the related replacement with the minimum liquidity covenant through and including the three month ending march and increase the permitted maximum leverage ratio for period of time following the three month ending march there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet either the minimum liquidity covenant or the maximum leverage ratio covenant applicable at any particular time and our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility depends on compliance with the applicable covenant further the lender have the right to require repayment of any amount borrowed under the facility if we are not in compliance with the applicable covenant there is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund our obligation or that it will be available on commercially reasonable term in which case we may need to seek other source of funding in addition the term of future debt agreement could include more restrictive covenant which could restrict our business operation see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource for more information on our liquidity and capital resource we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we conduct substantial majority of our business outside the united state but we report our result in dollar result we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar when the dollar strengthens against other currency in which we transact it generally did in our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income are lower expressed in dollar when the dollar weakens against other currency in which we transact it generally did in and our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income are higher expressed in dollar foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our financial result recent year have seen significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the british pound sterling the dollar and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can affect consumer travel behavior for example the strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro in made it more expensive for european to travel to the united state consumer traveling from country whose currency ha weakened against other currency may book lower adr accommodation choose to shorten or cancel their international travel plan or choose to travel domestically rather than internationally any of which could adversely affect our gross booking revenue and result of operation in particular when expressed in dollar since the beginning of the covid pandemic there ha been an overall strengthening of the euro and the british pound sterling relative to the dollar however result of the travel restriction and health concern arising from the covid pandemic we do not believe exchange rate have significantly altered consumer behavior since the pandemic began in foreign currency exchange rate and it impact on consumer behavior which may differ across region make it more difficult to forecast industry and consumer trend and the timing and degree of their impact on our market and business which in turn make it more difficult to manage our business and forecast our financial and operational performance our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control financial or operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor or our publicly disclosed estimate quarterly variation in our financial or operating result change in expectation to our future financial or operating

concern such the covid pandemic or other event announcement by third party of significant claim or initiation of litigation proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding addition or departure of key personnel and trading volume fluctuation or other market volatility sale of substantial number of share of our common stock including through the conversion of our convertible note could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller or short seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made or may make our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce or travel company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market

natural disaster health concern such the covid pandemic including any resurgence and the perceived pace or scale of any recovery from the pandemic or terrorist attack affecting significant market for our business such europe or the united state could cause our stock price to decline negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or the value of our stock for purpose of acquiring other company or business we have in the past been defendant in security class action litigation security class action litigation ha often been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of it security to the extent our stock price decline or is volatile we may in the future be the target of additional litigation this additional litigation could result in substantial cost and divert management attention and resource either of which could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we face increased risk if the level of our debt increase we have substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness and we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future including through public or private offering of debt security our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have significant consequence which may be amplified our cash flow and earnings have decreased result of the covid pandemic and which could include requiring the dedication of portion of our cash flow from operation to service our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure meeting our operating expense share repurchase and acquisition increased vulnerability to downturn in our business to competitive pressure and to adverse change in general economic and industry condition decreased or lost ability to obtain additional financing on term acceptable to for working capital capital expenditure acquisition share repurchase or other general corporate purpose and decreased flexibility when planning for or reacting to change in our business and industry our ability to make payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which will be subject to the rate of economic and travel industry recovery result of the covid pandemic general economic condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor affecting our result of operation and financial condition many of which are beyond our control further we may not have access to equity or debt market or other source of financing or such financing may not be available to on commercially reasonable term to repay or refinance our debt it come due or in the case of our convertible note upon conversion the value of our investment could decline which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity our portfolio typically includes marketable debt security equity security of publicly traded company the value of which are subject to market price volatility and investment in private company investment in government and corporate debt security and preferred stock classified debt security for accounting purpose are generally classified available for sale and consequently are recorded in our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gain or loss net of tax reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet credit loss on such investment are recorded in the consolidated statement of operation see note and to our consolidated financial statement change in the fair value of our investment in publicly traded equity security are recognized in the consolidated statement of operation these change could be volatile and they have had and are likely to continue to have significant impact on our quarterly net income or loss our investment in equity security other than those classified debt security for accounting purpose of private company are primarily measured at cost le impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from observable price change in orderly transaction for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer with change in value also recognized in the consolidated statement of operation see note and to our consolidated financial statement have invested in trip com group convertible note we have also invested in other chinese internet company meituan and didi chuxing see note and to our consolidated financial statement for more information regarding our investment in trip com group meituan and didi chuxing security the value of these security is subject to the risk associated with trip com group meituan and didi chuxing respective business well any change by the chinese government in foreign investment law or elevated scrutiny or regulation of foreign investment in chinese company for example trip com group is cayman island company operating in china through what is commonly referred to variable interest entity or vie structure where it conduct part of it business through contractual relationship with affiliated chinese entity although vie structure are commonly used by chinese internet and commerce company there are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation and application of people republic of china prc law and regulation to vie structure and it is possible that the prc government may view the vie structure violation of prc law vie contractual relationship are not effective in providing control over the affiliated chinese company direct ownership and trip com group would have to rely on the prc legal system to enforce those contract in the event of breach by one of these entity further conflict of interest could arise to the extent trip com group officer or director are also shareholder officer or director of the affiliated chinese entity any of these risk could materially and adversely affect trip com group business and therefore the value of our investment in trip com group similar vie structure consideration and risk apply with respect to our investment in security of meituan and didi chuxing each of which is cayman island company operating in china through vie structure our investment in private company are inherently risky in that such company are typically at an early stage of development may have no or limited revenue may not be or ever become profitable may not be able to secure additional funding or their technology service or product may not be successfully developed or introduced to the market further our ability to liquidate any such investment is typically dependent on liquidity event such public offering or acquisition no public market exists for such security valuation of privately held company are inherently complex and uncertain due to the lack of liquid market for such security if we determine that any of our equity investment in such company have experienced decline in value we are required to recognize the change in net income for example in the first quarter of we recognized an impairment of million related to our investment in didi chuxing that resulted from the negative impact of the covid pandemic on didi chuxing business for investment classified debt security any decline in value attributed to credit loss is also recognized in the consolidated statement of operation we could lose the full amount of any of our investment and any impairment of our investment have previously and could in the future have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation item unresolved staff comment none item property we lease office space facility for our corporate

contains forward looking statement which involve risk and uncertainty our actual result may differ materially from the result discussed in the forward looking statement factor that might cause those difference include those discussed in risk factor and elsewhere in this annual report on form we evaluate certain operating and financial measure on both an reported and constant currency basis we calculate constant currency by converting our current year period operating and financial result for transaction recorded in currency other than dollar using the corresponding prior year period monthly average exchange rate rather than the current year period monthly average exchange rate overviewour mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world we seek to empower people to cut through travel barrier such money time language and overwhelming option so they can use our service to easily and confidently go where they want to go stay where they want to stay dine where they want to dine pay how they want to pay and experience what they want to experience we connect consumer wishing to make travel reservation with provider of travel service around the world through our online platform through one or more of our brand consumer can book broad array of accommodation including hotel motel resort home apartment bed and breakfast hostel and other property make car rental reservation or arrange for an airport taxi make dinner reservation or book flight cruise vacation package tour or activity consumer can also use our meta search service to easily compare travel reservation information such airline ticket hotel reservation and rental car reservation information from hundred of online travel platform at once in addition we offer various other service to consumer and partner such certain travel related insurance product and restaurant management service to restaurant we offer these service through six primary consumer facing brand booking com priceline agoda rentalcars com kayak and opentable while historically our brand operated on largely independent basis and many of them focused on particular service accommodation reservation or geography we are increasing the collaboration cooperation and interdependency among our brand in our effort to provide consumer with the best and most comprehensive service we also seek to maximize the benefit of our scale by sharing resource and technological innovation co developing new service and coordinating activity in key market among our brand for example booking com the world leading brand for booking online accommodation reservation based on room night booked offer rental car and other ground transportation service flight tour and activity reservation restaurant reservation and other service many of which are supported by our other brand similarly hotel reservation available through booking com are also generally available through agoda and priceline see note to the consolidated financial statement segment reporting for information on our operating segment we refer to our company and all of our subsidiary and brand collectively booking holding the company we our or our business is driven primarily by international result which consist of the result of booking com agoda and rentalcars com in their entirety and the international business of kayak and opentable this classification is independent of where the consumer resides where the consumer is physically located while using our service or the location of the travel service provider or restaurant for example reservation made through booking com which is domiciled in the netherlands at hotel in new york by consumer in the united state is part of our international result in our international business the substantial majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our consolidated revenue significant majority of our revenue including significant majority of our international revenue is earned in connection with facilitating accommodation reservation see note to the consolidated financial statement for more geographic information we derive substantially all of our revenue from enabling consumer to make travel service reservation we also earn revenue from credit card processing rebate and customer processing fee advertising service restaurant reservation and restaurant management service and various other service such travel related insurance revenue response to the outbreak of the novel strain of the coronavirus covid the covid pandemic many government around the world have implemented and continue to implement variety of measure to reduce the spread of covid including travel restriction and ban instruction to resident to practice social distancing curfew quarantine advisory shelter in place order and required closure of non essential business these government mandate have forced many of the partner on whom our business relies including hotel and other accommodation provider airline and restaurant to seek government support in order to continue operating to curtail drastically their service offering or to cease operation entirely further these measure have materially adversely affected and may further adversely affect consumer sentiment and discretionary spending pattern economy and financial market and our workforce operation and customer the covid pandemic and the resulting economic condition and government order have resulted in material decrease in consumer spending and an unprecedented decline in travel and restaurant activity and consumer demand for related service our financial result and prospect are almost entirely dependent on the sale of travel related service our result for the year ended december have been materially and negatively impacted with material decline in gross travel booking room night booked total revenue net income and cash flow from operation compared to the year ended december newly booked room night reservation excluding the impact of cancellation declined rapidly the covid pandemic spread in the first quarter and the beginning of the second quarter of but then steadily improved through the end of the second quarter and into the summer travel period in the third quarter of however in the fourth quarter of we saw an increased decline in newly booked room night reservation due in part to increased covid case count and reimposed or additional government imposed travel restriction particularly in europe in september variant of covid that spread more easily and quickly than other variant wa first discovered in the united kingdom and ha since spread across the country and to other country including the united state and in europe another variant of covid that also appears to spread more easily and quickly than other variant wa detected in south africa in october in the fourth quarter of multiple covid vaccine were approved for widespread distribution throughout various part of the world including the united state and in europe while this news is encouraging it is still unknown when these vaccine will be available to broader population and whether they will be effective against variant of covid including the variant mentioned above we believe that effective vaccine become widely distributed people will feel it is safe to travel again and government restriction will be relaxed although the timing remains uncertain since april we have seen substantial year over year increase in the share of newly booked room night booked for domestic travel traveler booking stay within their own country while booking for international travel have remained limited throughout the pandemic over this same time period we have seen year over year increase in the share of our newly booked room night made on mobile device also while we saw an increase in the share of newly booked room night for alternative accommodation property in the early month of the pandemic more recently the share ha been consistent with pre pandemic level in addition we have observed an improvement in cancellation rate since the high in april though we have seen additional period of highly elevated cancellation rate typically coinciding with newly imposed travel restriction the overall improvement in cancellation rate since april benefit our room night booked including cancellation but doe not impact newly booked room night our revenue decline in wa impacted to greater extent than newly booked room night growth due to the impact of higher cancellation and lower accommodation average daily rate adrs compared to we expect to continue to see severely reduced new travel and restaurant reservation booking compared to level for the foreseeable future which will have materially adverse impact on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow further given the volatility in the global travel industry and the financial difficulty faced by many of our travel service provider and restaurant partner we have increased our provision for expected credit loss on receivables from and cash advance made to our travel service provider and restaurant partner due to the uncertain and rapidly evolving nature of current condition around the world we are unable to predict accurately the impact that the covid pandemic will have on our business going forward the approval and distribution of covid vaccine throughout the world is encouraging however the covid pandemic continues to impact global travel and travel restriction remain in place particularly in europe in the fourth quarter of we saw room night decline further well an increase in cancellation rate in each case compared to the third quarter of in january room night declined slightly more than the decline in the fourth quarter of however we have seen some improvement in these booking trend in recent week if these recent trend were to continue we currently expect that room night and gross booking in the first quarter of will decline relative to the first quarter of by few percentage point le than those metric declined in the fourth quarter of relative to the fourth quarter of we currently expect revenue in the first quarter of to decline by similar amount our expected decline in gross booking in the first quarter of both relative to the first quarter of the comparison of the first quarter of to the first quarter of avoids the distortion created from comparing to the initial spread of the covid pandemic late in the first quarter of in addition we expect that we will experience greater operating loss in the first quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of with the continued spread of covid throughout the world we expect the pandemic and it effect to continue to have significant adverse impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic during any resurgence of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery which could be an extended period of time for more information see part ii item risk factor the covid pandemic ha materially adversely affected and may further adversely impact our business and financial performance in response to the covid pandemic we have taken and are taking various action to address the impact of the pandemic on our business among other action we have raised billion in debt and negotiated amendment to our revolving credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility undertaken restructuring activity at all of our brand participated in certain government aid program including employee wage support program suspended general share repurchase eliminated non essential business travel canceled internal company event and offsites significantly reduced marketing spend worldwide implemented general temporary company wide hiring freeze for much of sold investment in government debt security corporate debt security and trip com group american depositaryshares ad further our chief executive officer and the chief executive officer of our brand voluntarily declined their salary certain other senior manager voluntarily reduced their salary and our non employee director voluntarily waived their cash fee for most of in response to the reduction in our business volume result of the impact of the covid pandemic during the year ended december we took action at all of our brand to reduce the size of our workforce to optimize efficiency and reduce cost which we expect to result in annualized cost saving of approximately million in personnel related expense in addition to the restructuring expense recorded during the year ended december and included in restructuring and other exit cost in the consolidated statement of operation we estimate that we will record approximately million of additional restructuring expense in early see note to our consolidated financial statement our headcount decreased year over year of december primarily due to the restructuring activity and attrition we have also been working with traveler and our travel service provider partner to deal with reservation cancellation and other disruption arising from the impact of the pandemic for example when the pandemic started booking com committed to allow cancellation of certain non refundable booking that were impacted by government travel restriction and opentable ha waived fee payable by restaurant for diner seated through opentable online reservation service and subscription fee for many restaurant the impact of the covid pandemic are wide ranging and affect all aspect of our business result the pandemic ha negatively affected our financial result and condition described throughout this annual report on form we anticipate that we will continue to make decision and take action to address the impact of the pandemic on our business including additional effort to reduce cost while preserving our ability to offer valuable service to consumer and partner when the industry recovers the full impact of the pandemic on our business is impossible to predict and therefore we may recognize additional negative impact to our operating result and financial condition in future period result of the pandemic certain government have passed or are considering modifying legislation to help business during the covid pandemic through loan wage subsidy tax relief or other financial aid and some of these government have extended or are considering extending these program we have participated in several of these program including the netherlands wage subsidy program and the united kingdom job retention scheme in addition certain government have extended support for the travel and tourism industry through special program whereby discount are extended to traveler through travel service provider or through travel agent for reservation facilitated by them we have participated in japan go to travel program and thailand we travel together program to the covid pandemic we experienced many year of significant growth in our accommodation reservation service we believe this growth wa the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the widespread adoption of mobile device and the growth of travel overall we also believe this growth wa the result of the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to increase the number and the variety of accommodation we offer consumer increase and improve content build distribution and improve the consumer experience on our online platform well consistently and effectively marketing our brand through performance and brand marketing effort prior to the covid pandemic these year over year growth rate generally decelerated due to the size of our accommodation reservation business and the generally slowing growth rate of the online travel market the travel market recovers from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect to see higher than pre covid pandemic growth rate until we return to the level of travel market demand that we observed prior to the covid pandemic after which we expect prior trend to generally resume we are global business and online travel growth rate vary across the world depending on numerous factor including local and regional economic condition individual disposable income access to the internet and adoption of commerce over the last several year and prior to the covid pandemic online travel growth rate had generally slowed in market such north america and europe where online activity wa high and consumer had been engaging in commerce transaction for many year while online travel growth rate remained relatively high in market such asia pacific where income were rising more quickly and the increased availability and use of mobile device had accelerated the growth of internet usage and travel commerce transaction over the long term we expect the broader global economy and online travel market to recover from the covid pandemic and following the recovery of the travel industry to the level of pre covid pandemic demand we would expect online travel growth rate will slow market continue to mature however we believe that the opportunity to grow our business beyond pre covid pandemic level exists for the market in which we operate including in both mature and le mature market further we believe that this opportunity for growth exists because we believe we provide significant value to travel service provider regardless of size or geography due to our global reach and marketing expertise for example we believe that accommodation provider of all size from large hotel chain to small independent hotel and alternative accommodation such home and apartment benefit from using our service which enable them to reach broader audience of potential customer historically our growth ha primarily been generated by the worldwide accommodation reservation business of booking com which is our most significant brand and ha been due in part to the availability of large number of property through booking com booking com included approximately property on it website at december consisting of approximately hotel motel and resort and approximately home apartment and other unique place to stay compared to approximately property including approximately hotel motel and resort and approximately home apartment and other unique place to stay at december booking com categorizes property listed on it website either hotel motel and resort which group together more traditional accommodation type including hostel and inn or home apartment and other unique place to stay also referred to alternative accommodation which encompasses all other type of accommodation including bed and breakfast villa apart hotel and beyond we intend to continue to improve the accommodation choice available for reservation on our platform however the number of accommodation on our platform may vary in part result of removing accommodation from time to time at december we saw year over year decrease in the number of property on booking com website compared to december driven by an elevated number of accommodation removed from the platform due primarily to the property not providing availability on our platform non payment of invoice or property closure we have continued to see year over year increase in the number of accommodation removed from our platform during the covid pandemic and we expect to see further accommodation removal in the future due to increase in property closure or change in ownership many of the newer accommodation we add to our travel reservation service especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or higher credit risk and may appeal to smaller subset of consumer hostel and bed and breakfast because alternative accommodation are often either single unit or small collection of independent unit these property generally represent more limited booking opportunity than hotel motel and resort which generally have more unit to rent per property further alternative accommodation in general may be subject to increased seasonality due to local tourism season or other factor or may not be available at peak time due to use by the property owner we may also experience lower profit margin with respect to these property due to certain additional cost such increased customer service cost related to offering these accommodation on our platform our alternative accommodation business ha grown these different characteristic have negatively impacted our profit margin and we expect this trend to continue further to the extent that these property represent an increasing percentage of the property on our platform the number of reservation per property will likely continue to decrease since alternative accommodation property typically have fewer opportunity per property we believe that continuing to improve the choice of accommodation available through our service in particular booking com will help to continue to grow our accommodation reservation business we are constantly innovating to grow our business by among other thing providing best in class user experience with intuitive easy to use online platform website and mobile apps to ensure that we are meeting the need of online consumer while aiming to exceed their expectation part of these ongoing effort we have long term strategy to build more integrated offering of multiple element of travel which we refer to the connected trip and we expect these effort to increase room night growth and revenue growth over time although we expect our effort to build the connected trip will increase revenue growth over time we may see negative impact on our operating margin in the near term we incur the expense associated with these investment further to the extent our non accommodation service grow faster than our accommodation service whether part of the connected trip or otherwise our operating margin may be negatively affected if we experience an increasing mix of revenue from lower margin service part of our strategy to provide more payment option to consumer and travel service provider increase the number and variety of accommodation available on booking com and enable the growth of our in destination activity business booking com is increasingly processing transaction on merchant basis where it facilitates payment from traveler for the service provided this allows booking com to process transaction for travel service provider and to increase it ability to offer secure and flexible transaction term to consumer such the form and timing of payment we believe that adding these type of service offering will benefit consumer and travel service provider well our gross booking room night and earnings growth rate however this result in additional expense for personnel payment processing customer chargebacks including those related to fraud and other expense related to these transaction which are recorded in personnel and sale and other expense in our consolidated statement of operation well associated incremental revenue in the form of credit card rebate for example which are recorded in merchant revenue to the extent more of our business is generated on merchant basis we will incur greater level of these merchant related expense which would negatively impact our operating margin despite increase in associated incremental revenue component of revenue and expense related to our merchant business may be recognized in different period these timing factor could impact our operating margin well the relationship between our gross booking and revenue in particular period especially our merchant business increase percentage of our overall business we compete globally with both online and traditional provider of travel and restaurant reservation and related service the market for the service we offer are intensely competitive constantly evolving and subject to rapid change and current and new competitor can launch new service at relatively low cost some of our current and potential competitor such google apple alibaba tencent amazon and facebook have significantly more customer or user consumer data and financial and other resource than we do and they may be able to leverage other aspect of their business search or mobile device business to enable them to compete more effectively with for example google ha entered various aspect of the online travel market and ha grown rapidly in this area including by offering flight meta search product google flight hotel meta search product google hotel ad vacation rental meta search product it book on google reservation functionality google travel planning tool that aggregate it flight hotel and package product in one website and by integrating it hotel meta search product and restaurant information and reservation product into it google map app moreover the economy and the travel industry recover from the impact of the covid pandemic the structure of the travel industry could change in unexpected way which could advantage or disadvantage and benefit certain of our existing competitor or new entrant result our historical strength may not provide the competitive advantage that they did prior to the pandemic if we are unable to successfully adapt to any change in how the travel industry operates or to change in the way in which consumer purchase travel service our ability to compete and therefore our business and result of operation would be adversely affected our market are also subject to rapidly changing condition including technological development consumer behavior change regulatory change and travel service provider consolidation we expect these trend to continue for example we have experienced significant shift of both direct and indirect business to mobile platform and our advertising partner are also seeing rapid shift of traffic to mobile platform in addition the revenue earned on mobile transaction may be le than typical desktop transaction due to different consumer purchasing pattern for example accommodation reservation made on mobile device typically are for shorter length of stay have lower accommodation adrs and are not made far in advance we observed an increasingly higher share of our newly booked room night made on mobile device throughout compared to the corresponding period in for more detail regarding the competitive trend and risk we face see part item business competition part item risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance and consumer adoption and use of mobile device creates challenge and may enable device company such google and apple to compete directly with and we may not be able to keep up with rapid technological or other market change we believe that providing an extensive collection of property excellent customer service and an intuitive easy to use consumer experience are important factor influencing consumer decision to make reservation for many consumer particularly in certain market the price of the travel service is the primary factor determining whether consumer will book reservation result it is increasingly important to offer travel service such accommodation reservation at competitive price whether through discount coupon closed user group rate or loyalty program or otherwise these initiative have resulted and in the future may result in lower adrs and lower revenue percentage of gross booking discounting and couponing coupled with high degree of consumer shopping behavior is particularly common in asian market in some case our competitor are willing to make little or no profit on transaction or offer travel service at loss in order to gain market share we have experienced meaningful decline in constant currency accommodation adrs since the outbreak of the covid pandemic and it is uncertain how long the covid pandemic will impact our adrs these declining adr trend have resulted in and may continue to result in our gross booking growing at lower rate of growth than our accommodation room night prior to the outbreak we observed trend of declining constant currency accommodation adrs we believe the trend of declining adrs observed prior to the outbreak wa partially driven by the negative impact of the changing geographical mix of our business lower adr region like asia pacific are generally growing faster than higher adr region like western europe well pricing pressure within local market from time to time which resulted from competitive condition weakening economic condition or change in travel pattern the travel market recovers from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect travel industry adrs generally to increase and result we expect our adrs similarly to increase during the recovery however it is uncertain whether industry adrs will improve at the same pace travel demand in addition we expect the adr trend we observed before the covid pandemic will generally resume after the recovery which would negatively pressure our adrs however there may also be period of stable or increasing adrs we have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through marketing and promotional campaign historically our marketing expense increased significantly however we experienced more moderate growth rate in recent year and since the covid pandemic our marketing expense have declined significantly our marketing expense is comprised of performance marketing and brand marketing expense our performance marketing expense which represents substantial majority of our marketing expense is primarily related to the use of online search engine primarily google meta search and travel research service and affiliate marketing to generate traffic to our website our brand marketing expense is primarily related to cost associated with producing and airing television advertising online video advertising for example on youtube and facebook online display advertising and other brand marketing total marketing expense were billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively we expect that our marketing expense in will remain significantly below level marketing efficiency expressed marketing expense percentage of total revenue is impacted by number of factor that are subject to variability and that are in some case outside of our control including adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign currency exchange rate our ability to convert paid traffic to booking customer the timing difference between when revenue is recognized and when marketing expense is recorded the timing and effectiveness of our brand marketing campaign and the extent to which consumer come directly to our platform for booking for example competition for desired ranking in search result and or decline in ad click by consumer could increase our cost per click and reduce our marketing efficiency change by google or any of our other search or meta search partner in how it present travel search result including if applicable by placing it own offering at or near the top of search result or the manner in which it conduct the auction for placement among search result may be competitively disadvantageous to and may impact our ability to efficiently generate traffic to our website we have observed long term trend of decreasing performance marketing return on investment roi however in recent year we observed period of stable or increasing roi during the first several month of the covid pandemic we experienced large year over year decline in roi driven by significant increase in cancellation rate while we have observed year over year decrease in roi for the year ended december roi have improved since the early month of the pandemic though we expect volatility in our roi for the duration of the pandemic when evaluating our performance marketing spend we typically consider several factor for each channel such the customer experience on the advertising platform the incrementality of the traffic we receive and the anticipated repeat rate from particular platform well other factor however with the significant decrease in demand due to the covid pandemic our performance marketing spend is highly influenced by expected cancellation rate in addition to the other factor listed above the amount of business we obtain through each performance marketing channel is impacted by numerous factor including the level of consumer demand for travel bidding decision by and our competitor including decision to optimize performance marketing roi and the marketing effort and success of those channel to attract consumer and generate demand see part item risk factor we rely on marketing channel to generate significant amount of traffic to our platform and grow our business and our could be negatively affected by change in online search and meta search algorithm and dynamic or traffic generating arrangement in recent year we experienced significant increase in our cancellation rate which negatively affected our marketing efficiency and result of operation however from the third quarter of until the fourth quarter of our cancellation rate generally decreased which benefited our marketing efficiency and result of operation since the covid pandemic we have experienced unprecedented increase in cancellation rate which negatively impacted our marketing efficiency and result of operation for example increased cancellation especially early in the pandemic have resulted in increased customer service cost well higher than normal cash outlay to refund consumer for prepaid reservation however in the second and third quarter of we saw steady improvement in cancellation rate which trended towards level that we observed prior to the covid pandemic in the fourth quarter of we saw reversal of the improving cancellation rate trend we expect to continue to see volatility in cancellation rate due to any resurgence of the pandemic leading to reinstituted or additional travel restriction shelter in place rule and reduced willingness to travel further in the fourth quarter of higher share of our newly booked room night reservation were made with flexible cancellation policy compared to the corresponding period in which could result in higher than normal cancellation rate in future quarter perceived or actual adverse economic condition including slow slowing or negative economic growth high or rising unemployment rate inflation and weakening currency and concern over government response such higher tax or tariff and reduced government spending have impaired and could in the future impair consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand we expect the lingering concern of consumer around the safety of traveling well reduced discretionary income could negatively impact leisure travel demand for an extended period of time further political uncertainty condition or event such the variety of measure implemented by many government around the world to reduce the spread of covid including travel restriction and ban instruction to resident to practice social distancing quarantine advisory shelter in place order and required closure of non essential business can also negatively affect consumer spending and adversely affect travel demand at time we have experienced volatility in transaction growth rate increased cancellation rate and weaker trend in adrs across many region of the world particularly in those country that appear to be most affected by economic and political uncertainty which we believe are due at least in part to these macro economic condition and concern for more detail see part item risk factor the covid pandemic ha materially adversely affected and may further adversely impact our business and financial performance and decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance these and other macro economic uncertainty such geopolitical tension and differing central bank monetary policy have led to period of significant volatility in the exchange rate between the dollar and the euro the british pound sterling and other currency significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate stock market and oil price can also impact consumer travel behavior noted earlier our international business represents substantial majority of our financial result therefore because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result and the financial condition of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar result both the absolute amount of and percentage change in our foreign currency denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar are affected by foreign currency exchange rate change however for the year ended december movement in foreign currency exchange rate had little to no impact on our performance metric and financial result since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation we designate certain portion of the aggregate principal value of our euro denominated debt hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on the net asset of one of our euro functional currency subsidiary foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the euro denominated debt that is not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operation see note to our consolidated financial statement such foreign currency transaction gain or loss are dependent on the amount of net asset of the euro functional currency subsidiary the amount of the euro denominated debt that is designated hedge and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate for more information see part item risk factor we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on our transactional balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency in period prior to the second quarter of we also entered into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our consolidated operating result into dollar however these instrument were short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact growth rate for our gross booking or revenue since the first quarter of we have not entered into such derivative instrument the impact of the pandemic on our operating result are highly uncertain we will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instrument in the future see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information related to our derivative contract many taxing authority are increasingly focused on way to increase tax revenue and have targeted large multinational technology company in these effort result many country have implemented or are considering the adoption of digital service tax that imposes tax on revenue earned from digital advertisement and the use of online platform even when there is no physical presence in the jurisdiction currently rate for this tax range from to of revenue deemed generated in the jurisdiction the digital service tax currently in effect which we record in general and administrative expense in consolidated statement of operation have negatively impacted our result of operation and if many other country pas similar legislation the collective impact of all of these measure could have materially adverse impact on our result of operation and cash flow for more information see part item risk factor we may have exposure to additional tax liability many national government have conducted or are conducting investigation into competitive practice within the online travel industry and we may be involved or affected by such investigation and their result some country have adopted or proposed legislation that could also affect business practice within the online travel industry for example france italy belgium and austria have passed legislation prohibiting parity contract clause in their entirety also number of government are investigating or conducting information gathering exercise with respect to compliance by online travel company otcs with consumer protection law including practice related to the display of search result and search ranking algorithm claim regarding discount disclosure of charge and availability and similar messaging in december the european commission proposed the digital market act and the digital service act which are expected to give regulator more instrument to investigate digital business and impose new rule on certain digital platform if they are determined to be gatekeeper the proposed legislation is not final and it is not known what the law will look like in their final form if adopted if the regulator were to determine that we are gatekeeper under the proposed legislation we could be subject to additional rule and regulation not applicable to all our competitor and our business could be harmed for more information on these investigation and their potential effect on our business see note to our consolidated financial statement and part item risk factor our business is subject to various competition anti trust consumer protection and online commerce law rule and regulation around the world and the size of our business grows scrutiny of our business by legislator and regulator in these area may intensify in addition to the price parity and consumer protection investigation from time to time national competition authority other governmental agency trade association and private party take legal action including commencing legal proceeding that may affect our operation in general increased regulatory focus on online business including online travel business like ours could result in increased compliance cost or otherwise adversely affect our business seasonality and other timing factorsin recent year the majority of our gross booking have been generated in the first half of the year consumer planned and reserved their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we would generally recognize revenue from these booking when the travel begin at check in which can be in quarter other than when the associated reservation are booked in contrast we expensed the substantial majority of our marketing activity the expense is incurred which in the case of marketing in particular is typically in the quarter in which associated reservation were booked result of this timing difference between when we recorded marketing expense and when we recognized associated revenue we have experienced our highest level of profitability in the third quarter of the year which is when we experienced the highest level of accommodation check in for the year for our european and north american market the first quarter of the year wa typically the quarter in which we recognized the lowest amount of revenue well the lowest level of profitability and highest level of volatility in earnings growth rate due to these seasonal timing factor the covid pandemic impacted seasonality in for example we witnessed higher share of travel being booked during the second and third quarter well higher share of stay during the third quarter than in prior year we can not currently predict travel pattern given the covid pandemic and we may not experience typical seasonality effect on our business in for several year we experienced an expansion of the booking window the average time between the booking of travel reservation and when the travel begin which impact the relationship between our gross booking recognized at the time of booking and our revenue recognized at the time of check in however we saw contraction of the booking window throughout and due to the impact of the covid pandemic on our booking trend we saw an initial expansion in the booking window in the second quarter versus the comparable prior year period an increased percentage of newly booked room night were made for travel occurring in the third quarter however in the third and fourth quarter we saw significant contraction of the booking window versus the comparable prior year period an increased percentage of newly room night were made for travel that wa to occur close to the time of booking we expect that the length of the booking window will be volatile and difficult to predict throughout the duration of the covid pandemic future change in the length of the booking window will affect the degree to which our gross booking and revenue occur in the same period and result whether our gross booking growth rate and revenue growth rate converge or diverge in addition the date on which certain holiday fall can have an impact on our quarterly result for example in easter fell on april and easter related travel began in the second quarter when the associated revenue wa recognized by comparison in easter wa on april and meaningful amount of easter related travel began in the week leading up to the holiday with the associated revenue being recognized in the first quarter of result of the shift in easter timing relative to our first quarter year over year growth rate in revenue operating income and operating margin were negatively impacted and our second quarter year over year growth rate were positively impacted in easter fell on april in the second quarter it did in and result we did not experience meaningful impact to our year over year growth rate in from the easter holiday due to the significant reduction in travel demand related to the covid pandemic we do not expect the timing of the easter holiday to have meaningful impact on our growth rate in the timing of other holiday such ramadan can also impact our quarterly year over year growth rate the impact of seasonality can be exaggerated in the short term by the gross booking growth rate of the business for example in period where our gross booking growth rate substantially decelerates our operating margin typically benefit from relatively le variable marketing expense in addition revenue growth is typically le impacted by decelerating gross booking growth in the near term due to the benefit of revenue related to reservation booked in previous quarter but any such deceleration would negatively impact revenue growth in subsequent period conversely in period where our gross booking growth rate accelerates our operating margin are typically negatively impacted by relatively more variable marketing expense in addition revenue growth is typically le impacted by accelerating gross booking growth in the near term but any such acceleration would positively impact revenue growth in subsequent period portion of the revenue recognized from such gross booking will occur in future quarter the travel market recovers from the impact of the covid pandemic we expect to see higher than pre covid pandemic growth rate which will likely result in period where our operating margin are negatively impacted due to the timing difference of when marketing expense is recorded and when revenue is recognized other factorswe believe that our future success depends in large part on our ability to continue to profitably grow our brand worldwide and over time to offer other travel and travel related service factor beyond our control such oil price stock market volatility terrorist attack unusual or extreme weather or natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood fire drought and volcanic eruption travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such covid and other coronaviruses ebola and zika political instability change in economic condition war and regional hostility imposition of tax tariff or surcharge by regulatory authority change in trade policy or trade dispute change in immigration policy or travel related accident or increased focus on the environmental impact of travel can disrupt travel limit the ability or willingness of traveler to visit certain location or otherwise result in decline in travel demand these kind of event have negatively affected our business and result of operation in the past and may do so again in the future because these event or concern and the full impact of their effect are largely unpredictable they can dramatically and suddenly affect travel behavior by consumer and therefore demand for our service and our relationship with travel service provider and other partner any of which can adversely affect our business and result of operation see part item risk factor the covid pandemic ha materially adversely affected and may further adversely impact our business and financial performance and decline or disruption in the travel industry could adversely affect our business and financial performance the extent of the effect of the covid pandemic on our business result of operation cash flow and growth prospect is highly uncertain and will ultimately depend on future development we expect the pandemic and it effect to continue to have significant adverse impact on our business for the duration of the pandemic and during the subsequent economic recovery which could be an extended period of time over the long term we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result even if those expenditure create pressure on operating margin in recent year we have experienced pressure on operating margin we invested in initiative to drive future growth we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing acquisition we believe competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of service and technology including service and technology that may be outside of our historical core business and our ability to keep pace may slow potential competitor such emerging start ups may be able to innovate and focus on developing particularly new product or service faster than we can or may foresee consumer need for new service or technology before some of our larger competitor or potential have more resource or more established or diversified relationship with consumer than we do and they could use these advantage in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition entering or investing in travel reservation business investing in research and development and competing aggressively for highly skilled employee for example because consumer often utilize other online service more frequently than online travel service competitor or potential competitor that ha established other more frequent online interaction with consumer may be able to more easily or cost effectively acquire customer for it online travel service than we can our goal is to grow revenue and achieve healthy operating margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain and highly competitive environment in which we operate make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we may not be able to return to the level of revenue growth and profitability we experienced prior to the covid pandemic critical accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate we evaluate our estimate on an ongoing basis estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our critical accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following valuation of goodwill and other long lived asset the application of the acquisition accounting for business combination requires the use of significant estimate and assumption to determine the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed our estimate of the fair value are based upon assumption that we believe are reasonable when we deem appropriate we utilize assistance from third party valuation firm the consideration transferred is allocated to the asset acquired and liability assumed based on their respective fair value at the acquisition date the excess of the consideration transferred over the net of the amount allocated to the identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is recognized goodwill goodwill is assigned to reporting unit that are expected to benefit from the synergy of the business combination of the acquisition date substantial portion of our intangible asset and goodwill relates to the acquisition of opentable and kayak we review long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable the assessment of possible impairment is based upon the ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the estimated undiscounted future net cash flow before interest and tax of the related asset group due to the significant and negative financial impact of the covid pandemic we performed the recoverability test of our long lived asset and concluded there wa no impairment at march for opentable and kayak we tested the recoverability of the long lived asset and concluded there wa no impairment at september we did not identify any additional impairment indicator for our long lived asset at december we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying amount we test goodwill at reporting unit level our annual goodwill impairment test are performed of september interim goodwill impairment testdue to the significant and negative financial impact of the covid pandemic we performed an interim period goodwill impairment test at march under the current goodwill impairment standard adopted in the first quarter of goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which reporting unit carrying amount exceeds it fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill see note to our consolidated financial statement of march the estimated fair value of each of our reporting unit except the opentable and kayak reporting unit substantially exceeded it respective carrying value for the opentable and kayak reporting unit we recognized goodwill impairment charge of million for the three month ended march which is not tax resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for opentable and kayak of billion at march the goodwill impairment wa primarily driven by significant reduction in the forecasted near term cash flow of opentable and kayak well the significant decline in comparable company market value result of the covid pandemic the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak wa determined using combination of standard valuation technique including an income approach discounted cash flow and market approach applying the recent decline in enterprise value of comparable publicly traded company to the recently calculated fair value for opentable and kayak well applying comparable company multiple the income approach estimate fair value utilizing long term growth rate and discount rate applied to the cash flow projection in the cash flow projection we assumed that opentable and kayak will experience significant decline in near term cash flow with recovery to level of financial performance including profitability occurring in the shape and timing of the recovery wa key assumption in our fair value calculation both in the income and market approach annual goodwill impairment testa of september we performed our annual goodwill impairment test other than the opentable and kayak reporting unit the fair value of our reporting unit substantially exceeded their respective carrying value for the opentable and kayak reporting unit we recognized goodwill impairment charge of million for the three month ended september which is not tax deductible resulting in an adjusted carrying value of goodwill for opentable and kayak of billion at september the goodwill impairment wa primarily driven by significant reduction in the forecasted cash flow of opentable and kayak reflecting longer assumed recovery period to level of profitability mainly due to the continued material adverse impact of the covid pandemic including it impact on the flight vertical at kayak and the lowered outlook for monetization opportunity in restaurant reservation service the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak wa determined using combination of standard valuation technique including an income approach discounted cash flow and market approach applying comparable company multiple the income approach estimate fair value utilizing long term growth rate and discount rate applied to the cash flow projection the income approach applied of september reflected reduction in the forecasted cash flow of opentable and kayak and longer assumed recovery period to level of profitability driven primarily by lowered outlook for monetization opportunity in restaurant reservation service and slower than previously expected recovery trend for airline travel which is key vertical for kayak for the interim goodwill impairment test at march we expected recovery to level of financial performance occurring in for opentable and kayak based on our evaluation of all relevant information available of september for the annual goodwill impairment test we expected that opentable and kayak would not return to the level of profitability within the next five year and that it wa uncertain whether the shape of the recovery would ultimately match our expectation an increase or decrease of one percentage point to the profitability growth rate used in the cash flow projection would result in an increase or decrease of approximately million to the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak at september the discount rate is determined based on the reporting unit estimated weighted average cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in it cash flow which requires significant judgment the discount rate used for the annual goodwill impairment test of september is higher than the discount rate used for the interim goodwill impairment test of march if the discount rate used in the income approach increase or decrease by the impact to the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak at september range from decrease of approximately million to an increase of approximately million the estimation of fair value reflects numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding opentable and kayak expected growth rate and operating margin expected length and severity of the impact from the covid pandemic the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the competitive environment well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of our control such discount rate and market comparables it requires significant judgment and estimate and actual result could be materially different than the judgment and estimate used to estimate fair value future event and changing market condition may lead to re evaluate the assumption reflected in the current forecast disclosed above particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery which may result in need to recognize an additional goodwill impairment charge that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation additional impairment indicator were identified of december valuation of investment in private companiessee note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the investment in private company the fair value of these investment are measured using unobservable input when little or no market data is available level input see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information our investment measured using level input primarily consist of preferred stock investment in privately held company that are classified either debt security or equity security without readily determinable fair value fair value of privately held security are estimated using variety of valuation methodology including both market and income approach we have used valuation technique appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee of the valuation date to determine fair value recent financing transaction in the investee such new investment in preferred stock are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used basis to estimate fair value however based on number of factor such the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other term of these financing transaction we may also use other valuation technique to supplement this data including the income approach in addition an option pricing model opm is utilized to allocate value to the various class of security of the investee including the class owned by the model includes assumption around the investees expected time to liquidity and volatility our investment in grab which is classified debt security for accounting purpose had an aggregate estimated fair value of million at december and we measured this investment using level input and management estimate that incorporate current market participant expectation of future cash flow considered alongside recent financing transaction of the investee and other relevant information we performed an impairment analysis on the investment in didi chuxing at march considering the impact of the covid pandemic which resulted in an adjusted carrying value of million at march and december no additional impairment indicator were identified of december discussed below we used unobservable input in order to determine fair value we used an income approach in estimating the fair value of didi chuxing of march the income approach estimate value based on the expectation of future cash flow that company will generate these future cash flow are discounted to their present value using discount rate based on company weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in it cash flow the key unobservable input and range used include the weighted average cost of capital terminal earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple volatility and an estimated time to liquidity of year significant change in any of these input in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurement generally change in the assumption used for terminal ebitda multiple would result in directionally similar change in the fair value and change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital or volatility would result in directionally opposite change in the fair value the determination of the fair value of investment where we are minority shareholder and have access to limited information from the investee reflects numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding the investee expected growth rate and operating margin expected length and severity of the impact of the covid pandemic on the investee and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of our control such discount rate and market comparables it requires significant judgment and estimate and actual result could be materially different than those judgment and estimate utilized in the fair value estimate future event and changing market condition may lead to re evaluate the assumption reflected in our valuation particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the overall impact on the investee business which may result in need to recognize an additional impairment charge that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation income tax we determine our tax expense based on our income and statutory tax rate applicable in the various jurisdiction in which we operate due to the complex nature of tax legislation and frequent change with such associated legislation significant judgment is required in computing our tax expense and determining our tax position the tax cut and job act the tax act enacted in december made significant change to federal tax law including reduction in the federal statutory tax rate from to effective january the tax act imposed one time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated unremitted international earnings to be paid over eight year do not intend to indefinitely reinvest our international earnings that were subject to taxation pursuant to the mandatory deemed repatriation or subject to taxation gilti we regularly review our deferred tax asset for recoverability considering historical profitability projected future taxable income the expected timing of the reversal of temporary difference and tax planning strategy and record valuation allowance required we are subject to ongoing tax examination and assessment in various jurisdiction we have been audited in many jurisdiction and from time to time face challenge from the tax authority regarding the amount of tax due these challenge include question regarding the timing and amount of deduction that we have taken on our tax return although we believe that our tax filing position are reasonable and comply with applicable law we regularly review our tax filing position especially in light of tax law or business practice change and we may change our position or determine that previous position should be amended either of which could result in additional tax liability the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute may be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual the evaluation of tax position and recognition of income tax benefit require significant judgment and we consult with external tax and legal counsel appropriate we consider the technical merit of our tax position along with the applicable tax statute related interpretation and precedent and our expectation of the outcome of proceeding or negotiation with tax authority we recognize liability when we believe that uncertain position may not be fully sustained upon audit by the tax authority including any related appeal or litigation process liability recognized for uncertain tax position are based on two step approach for recognition and measurement first we evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained based on it technical merit second we measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement interest and penalty attributable to uncertain tax position if any are recognized component of income tax expense the tax benefit ultimately realized by may be different than what is recorded in the financial statement due to future event such our settling the matter with the tax authority and our success in sustaining our tax position see note and to our consolidated financial statement for further information contingenciesloss contingency other than income tax related contingency disclosed above arise from actual or possible claim and assessment and pending or threatened litigation that may be brought against by individual government or other entity based on our assessment of loss contingency at each balance sheet date loss is recorded in the financial statement if it is probable that an asset ha been impaired or liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated if the amount of the loss can not be reasonably estimated we disclose information about the contingency in the financial statement we also disclose information in our financial statement about reasonably possible loss contingency the determination of whether loss is probable and whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated requires significant judgment and evaluation of all the underlying fact and circumstance including judgment about the potential action of third party claimant regulatory authority and court claim assessment and litigation involve significant uncertainty such the complexity of the fact the legal theory involved the nature of the claim the judgment of the court the applicable methodology for determining potential damage and in the case of class action whether class action can be certified the extent to which member of class would or would not file claim and the uncertainty inherent in class action on quarterly basis we update our analysis and estimate considering all available information including the impact of negotiation settlement ruling and advice of legal counsel change in our assessment of whether loss is probable our estimate of the loss or our determination of whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated could have material impact on our result of operation and financial position change in our assumption regarding particular matter or the effectiveness of our strategy related to legal and other proceeding could also have material impact on our result of operation and financial position for all loss contingency until matter is finally resolved there may be an exposure to loss in excess of the liability accrued for the matter and such amount could be material see note to our consolidated financial statement for further information recent accounting pronouncement see note to our consolidated financial statement for detail which is incorporated into this item by reference thereto of operation year ended december compared to year ended december evaluate certain operating and financial measure on both an reported and constant currency basis we calculate constant currency by converting our current year

french tax authority for payment of the amount assessed against booking com for the year through in january we paid the assessment of approximately million euro million in order to preserve our right to contest those assessment in court the payment which is included in other asset net in the consolidated balance sheet at december and doe not constitute an admission that we owe the tax and will be

netherlands supreme court in october the dutch advocate general issued an opinion to the supreme court stating that the dutch advocate general belief the decision of the court of appeal to be incorrect based on interpretation of the pension scheme requirement we have submitted to the supreme court response to the advocate general opinion while we continue to believe that booking com is in compliance with it pension obligation and that the dutch supreme court should uphold the ruling of the court of appeal based on the significant influence the dutch advocate general opinion typically ha on the supreme court we have reevaluated the probability of loss and believe it is probable that we have incurred loss related to this matter we expect the dutch supreme court to rule in the first quarter of in the event the supreme court overturn the decision of the court of appeal and remand the case to lower court we intend to pursue number of defense in any subsequent proceeding and may ultimately prevail in whole or in part we are not able to reasonably estimate loss or range of loss because the litigation is ongoing and there are significant factual and legal question yet to be determined result of december we have not recorded liability in connection with potential adverse outcome to this litigation however if booking com were to ultimately lose and all of bpf claim were to

exposure to several type of market risk change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity price we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign currency exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with financial analyst and investment banker regarding current and future economic condition and the review of market projection to expected future rate we utilize this information to determine our own investment strategy well to determine if the use of derivative financial instrument is appropriate to mitigate any potential future market exposure that we may face our policy doe not allow speculation in derivative instrument for profit or execution of derivative instrument contract for which there are no underlying exposure we do not use financial instrument for trading purpose and are not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate affect general economic condition we would also be

the consolidated financial statement our investment in trip com group convertible senior note are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of trip com group american depositary share ad than change in interest rate the estimated fair value of our trip com group convertible senior note will likely increase the market price of trip com group ad increase and will likely decrease the market price of trip com group ad fall at december and the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our debt wa billion and billion respectively we estimate that the fair value of such debt wa approximately billion and billion at december and respectively the estimated fair value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at december primarily relates to senior note and the convertible senior note issued in april the estimated fair value of the company debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount at december primarily relates to the conversion premium on the convertible senior note excluding the effect on the fair value of our convertible senior note hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate would have resulted in an increase in the estimated fair value of our other debt of approximately million and million at december and respectively our convertible senior note are more sensitive to the equity market price volatility of our share than change in interest rate the fair value of the convertible senior note will likely increase the market price of our share increase and will likely decrease the market price of our share fall our international business represents substantial majority of our financial result therefore because we report our result in dollar we face exposure to movement in foreign currency exchange rate the financial result and the financial condition of our international business are translated from local currency principally euro and british pound sterling into dollar if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income similarly our net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income will decrease if the dollar strengthens against the local currency however for the year ended december movement in foreign currency exchange rate had little to no impact on our performance metric and financial result since our expense are generally denominated in foreign currency on basis similar to our revenue our operating margin have not been significantly impacted by currency fluctuation additionally foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operation we have significant investment that is denominated in hong kong dollar and the related impact from the movement in foreign currency exchange rate is recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement and operation we designate certain portion of the aggregate principal value of the euro denominated debt hedge against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on the net asset of one of our euro functional currency subsidiary foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the euro denominated debt that is not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose are recognized in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operation see note to our consolidated financial statement such foreign currency transaction gain or loss are dependent on the amount of asset of the euro functional currency subsidiary the amount of the euro denominated debt that is designated hedge and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency forward contract to hedge our exposure to the impact of movement in foreign currency exchange rate on our transactional balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency in period prior to the second quarter of we also entered into foreign currency derivative contract to hedge translation risk from short term foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation for the euro british pound sterling and certain other currency versus the dollar since the first quarter of we have not entered into such derivative instrument the impact of the covid pandemic on our operating result are highly uncertain we will continue to evaluate the use of derivative instrument in the future see note to our

that are observable either directly or indirectly such price may be based upon quoted price for identical or comparable security in active market or input not quoted on active market but corroborated by market data level unobservable input are used when little or no market data is available investmentssee note for additional information related to the company investment the valuation of investment in corporate debt security and international government security and trip com group convertible debt security are considered level valuation because the company ha access to quoted price but doe not have visibility into the volume and frequency of trading for these investment market approach is used for recurring fair value measurement and the valuation technique use input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable data in an active marketplace in private company measured using level inputsthe company investment measured using level input primarily consist of preferred stock investment in privately held company that are classified either debt security or equity security without readily determinable fair value fair value of privately held security are estimated using variety of valuation methodology including both market and income approach the company ha used valuation technique appropriate for the type of investment and the information available about the investee of the valuation date to determine fair value recent financing transaction in the investee such new investment in preferred stock are generally considered the best indication of the enterprise value and therefore used basis to estimate fair value however based on number of factor such the proximity in timing to the valuation date or the volume or other term of these financing transaction the company may also use other valuation technique to supplement this data including the income approach in addition an option pricing model opm is utilized to allocate value to the various class of security of the investee including the class owned by the company the model includes assumption around the investees expected time to liquidity and volatility the company investment in grab which is classified debt security for accounting purpose had an aggregate estimated fair value of million at december and the company measured this investment using level input and management

in equity security of didi chuxing considering the impact of the covid pandemic the company performed an impairment analysis of march resulting in an adjusted carrying value of million at march and december no additional impairment indicator were identified of december discussed below the company used unobservable input in order to determine fair value the company used an income approach in estimating the fair value of didi chuxing of march the income approach estimate value based on the expectation of future cash flow that company will generate these future cash flow are discounted to their present value using discount rate based on company weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in it cash flow the key unobservable input and range used include the weighted average cost of capital terminal ebitda multiple volatility and an estimated time to liquidity of year significant change in any of these input in isolation would result in significantly different fair value measurement generally change in the assumption used for terminal ebitda multiple would result in directionally similar change in the fair value and change in the assumption used for weighted average cost of capital or volatility would result in directionally opposite change in the fair value the determination of the fair value of investment where the company is minority shareholder and ha access to limited information from the investee reflects numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding the investee expected growth rate and operating margin expected length and severity of the impact of the covid pandemic on the investee and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery well other key assumption with respect to matter outside of the company control such discount rate and market comparables it requires significant judgment and estimate and actual result could be materially different than those judgment and estimate utilized in the fair value estimate future event and changing market condition may lead the company to re evaluate the assumption reflected in the valuation particularly the assumption related to the length and severity of the covid pandemic and the shape and timing of the subsequent recovery and the overall impact on the investee business which may result in need to recognize an additional impairment charge that could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation derivativesthe company derivative instrument are valued using pricing model pricing model take into account the contract term well multiple input where applicable such interest rate yield curve option volatility and foreign currency exchange rate the valuation of derivative are considered level fair value measurement the company derivative instrument are typically short term in nature in the normal course of business the company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation the company mitigates these risk by following established risk management policy and procedure including the use of derivative the company enters into foreign currency forward contract to

rate is determined based on the reporting unit estimated weighted average cost of capital and adjusted to reflect the risk inherent in it cash flow which requires significant judgment the discount rate used for the annual goodwill impairment test of september is higher than the discount rate used for the interim goodwill impairment test of march if the discount rate used in the income approach increase or decrease by the impact to the estimated fair value of opentable and kayak at september range from decrease of approximately million to an increase of approximately million the estimation of fair value reflects numerous assumption that are subject to various risk and uncertainty including key assumption regarding opentable and kayak expected growth rate and operating margin expected

resident each of the plaintiff in these matter is requesting certification of class and the company is defending against class certification if the court were to grant class certification for any of these matter and if the plaintiff were successful on the merit of the claim the company could be required to pay damage however it is not reasonably possible to estimate the amount of such damage because the likelihood of class certification and the success of the merit of these case are both speculative at this stage in the litigation and also because reasonable assessment of the size of any potential class is not possible at this time although booking com ha not been sued german hotel association ha threatened booking com with class action lawsuit on behalf of group of german hotel that alleges that the hotel overpaid commission to booking com because of wide parity term in the contract between the hotel and booking com between and booking com is pursuing court proceeding in the

adverse outcome the company could be required to pay damage although the company belief the claim to be without merit and intends to defend against the claim if the hotel association were successful in any litigation and the company were required to pay damage the amount be significant the company can not reasonably estimate an amount of potential loss because there are several unknown variable at this early stage including that the plaintiff ha not yet filed lawsuit the company is unable to predict how any current or future investigation or litigation may be resolved or the long term impact of any such resolution on it business for example competition and consumer law related investigation legislation or issue have and could in the future result in private litigation more immediate
