for food animal product and to veterinarian for companion animal product elanco also advertises certain companion animal product directly to pet owner in market where it is consistent with allowable promotional practice competitionour human pharmaceutical product compete globally with product of many other company in highly competitive market our animal health product compete globally with product of animal health care company well pharmaceutical chemical and other company that operate animal health business important competitive factor for both human pharmaceutical and animal health product include effectiveness safety and ease of use price and demonstrated cost effectiveness marketing effectiveness and research and development of new product process and us most new product that we introduce must compete with other branded or generic product already on the market or product that are later developed by competitor if competitor introduce new product or delivery system with therapeutic or cost advantage our product can be subject to decreased sale progressive price reduction or both we believe our long term competitive success depends upon discovering and developing either alone or in collaboration with others or acquiring innovative cost effective human pharmaceutical and animal health product that provide improved outcome and deliver value to payer and continuously improving the productivity of our operation in highly competitive environment can be no assurance that our effort will result in commercially successful product and it is possible that our product will be or become uncompetitive from time to time result of product developed by our competitor pharmaceuticalsone of the biggest competitive challenge we face is from generic pharmaceutical in the and the eu the regulatory approval process for human pharmaceutical other than biological product biologics exempts generic from costly and time consuming clinical trial to demonstrate their safety and efficacy allowing generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy of the innovator product therefore generic manufacturer generally invest far le than we do in research and development and can price their product much lower than our branded product accordingly branded non biologic human pharmaceutical loses it market exclusivity it normally face intense price competition from generic form of the product public and private payer typically encourage the use of generic alternative to brand name drug in their healthcare program law in the generally allow and in many case require pharmacist to substitute generic drug that have been rated under government procedure to be essentially equivalent to brand name drug where substitution is mandatory it must be made unless the prescribing physician expressly forbids it in many country outside the intellectual property protection is weak and we must compete with generic or counterfeit version of our product many of our animal health product also compete with generic biosimilarsseveral of our current product including cyramza erbitux trulicity portrazza and taltz and many of the new molecular entity nmes in our research pipeline are biologics competition for lilly biologics may be affected by the approval of follow on biologics also known biosimilars biosimilar is subsequent version of an approved innovator biologic that due to it physical and or structural similarity to the original product is approved based on an abbreviated data package that relies in part on the full testing required of the originator product globally government have or are developing regulatory pathway to approve biosimilars alternative to innovator developed biologics but the patent for the existing branded product must expire in given market biosimilars may enter that market the extent to which biosimilar approved will be substituted for the innovator biologic in way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non biologic product is not yet entirely clear and will depend on number of regulatory and marketplace factor that are still developing biosimilars may present both competitive challenge and opportunity for example competitor company ha developed version of insulin lispro which will compete with our product humalog and other company are in the process of developing similar product on the other hand with our partner boehringer ingelheim we developed basaglar new insulin glargine product which ha the same amino acid sequence the product currently marketed by competitor this product ha launched follow on biologic in the and biosimilar in the eu and japan private sector dynamicsin the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider is also major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceutical health plan and pharmaceutical benefit manager have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance recently cv health large pharmaceutical benefit manager and pharmacy chain announced the planned acquisition of aetna large national insurer payer typically maintain formulary which specify coverage the condition under which drug are included on plan formulary and reimbursement the associated of pocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restriction such prior authorization and formulary exclusion or due to reimbursement limitation which result in higher consumer out of pocket cost such non preferred co pay tier increased co insurance level and higher deductible consequently pharmaceutical company compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attribute such efficacy safety profile or patient ease of use but also by providing rebate price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decision particularly in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressure could negatively affect our future consolidated result of operation trademark and other intellectual property rightsoverviewintellectual property protection is critical to our ability to successfully commercialize our life science innovation and invest in the search for new medicine we own have applied for or are licensed under large number of patent in the and many other country relating to product product us formulation and manufacturing process in addition discussed for some product we have additional effective intellectual property protection in the form of data protection under pharmaceutical regulatory law the patent protection anticipated to be of most relevance to human pharmaceutical is provided by national patent claiming the active ingredient the compound patent particularly those in major market such the various european country and japan these patent may be issued based upon the filing of international patent application usually filed under the patent cooperation treaty pct patent application covering the compound are generally filed during the discovery research phase of the drug discovery process which is described in the research and development section below in general national patent in each relevant country are available for period of year from the filing date of the pct application which is often year prior to the launch of commercial product patent term adjustment and restoration may extend the original patent term patent term adjustment is statutory right available to all patent applicant to provide relief in the event that patent is delayed during examination by the united state patent and trademark office uspto patent term restoration is statutory right provided to patent that claim invention subject to review by the food and drug administration fda single patent for human pharmaceutical product may be eligible for patent term restoration to make for portion of the time invested in clinical trial and the fda review process patent term restoration is limited by formula and can not be calculated product approval due to uncertainty about the duration of clinical trial and the time it take the fda to review an application there is five year cap on any restoration and no patent may be extended for more than year beyond fda approval some country outside the also offer form of patent term restoration for example supplementary protection certificate are sometimes available to extend the life of european patent up to an additional five year similarly in japan korea and australia patent term can be extended up to five year depending on the length of regulatory review and other factor loss of effective patent protection for human pharmaceutical typically result in the loss of effective market exclusivity for the product which often result in severe and rapid decline in revenue for the product however in some case the innovator company may be protected from approval of generic or other follow on version of new medicine beyond the expiration of the compound patent through manufacturing trade secret later expiring patent on method of use or formulation or data protection that may be available under pharmaceutical regulatory law the primary form of data protection are follows regulatory authority in major market generally grant data package protection for period of year following new drug approval in recognition of the substantial investment required to complete clinical trial data package protection prohibits other manufacturer from submitting regulatory application for marketing approval based on the innovator company regulatory submission data for the drug the base period of data package protection depends on the country for example the period is five year in the year for new biologics described below year in the eu and eight year in japan the period begin on the date of product approval and run concurrently with the patent term for any relevant patent under the biologics price competition and innovation act of the fda ha the authority to approve biosimilars competitor seeking approval of biosimilar must file an application to show it molecule is highly similar to an approved innovator biologic and include certain amount of safety and efficacy data that the fda will determine on case by case basis under the data protection provision of this law the fda can not approve biosimilar application until year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic subject to certain condition in the the fda ha the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drug where the sponsor conduct specified testing in pediatric or adolescent population within specified time period if granted this pediatric exclusivity provides an additional six month of exclusivity which is added to the term of data protection well to the term of any relevant patent to the extent these protection have not already expired while the term of the pediatric exclusivity attache to the term of any relevant patent pediatric exclusivity is regulatory exclusivity bar to generic approval not patent right under the orphan drug law specific use of drug or biologic can receive orphan designation if it is intended to treat disease or condition affecting fewer than people in the or affecting more than people but not reasonably expected to recover it development and marketing cost through sale among other benefit orphan designation entitles the particular use of the drug to seven year of market exclusivity meaning that the fda can not with limited exception approve another marketing application for the same drug for the same indication until expiration of the seven year period unlike pediatric exclusivity the orphan exclusivity period is independent of and run in parallel with any applicable patent outside the major market the adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property protection for human pharmaceutical varies widely and in number of these market we are unable to patent our product or to enforce the patent we receive for our product under the trade related aspect of intellectual property agreement trip administered by the world trade organization more than country have agreed to provide non discriminatory protection for most pharmaceutical invention and to assure that adequate and effective right are available to patent owner implementation of this agreement differs between developed and developing country with many developing country limiting protection for biopharmaceutical product under their interpretation of flexibility allowed under the agreement thus certain type of patent such those on new us of compound or new form of molecule are not available in many developing country further many developing country and some developed country do not provide effective data package protection even though it is specified in trip certain of our elanco animal health product are covered by patent or other form of intellectual property protection historically upon loss of effective market exclusivity for our animal health product we have not generally experienced the rapid and severe decline in revenue that are common in the human pharmaceutical segment there is no assurance that the patent we are seeking will be granted or that the patent we hold will be found valid and enforceable if challenged moreover patent relating to particular product us formulation or process do not preclude other manufacturer from employing alternative process or marketing alternative product or formulation that compete with our patented product in addition competitor or other third party may assert claim that our activity infringe patent or other intellectual property right held by or allege third party right of ownership in our existing intellectual property our intellectual property portfoliowe consider intellectual property protection for certain product process us and formulation particularly with respect to those product discussed below to be important to our operation for many of our product in addition to the compound patent we hold other patent on manufacturing process formulation or us that may extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the compound patent the most relevant patent protection or data protection for our top selling or recently launched patent protected marketed product is follows alimta is protected by vitamin regimen patent plus pediatric exclusivity cialis is protected by compound patent plus pediatric exclusivity may and unit dose patent exclusivity expected through at least september cyramza is protected by biologics data package protection effient is protected by patent covering method of using effient with aspirin the method patent were held unpatentable in an inter partes review ipr and we are appealing those decision for further information see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency forteo is protected by patent primarily covering it formulation and related process december and use patent

is protected by compound patent additional information about this molecule is provided in item management discussion and analysis executive overview late stage pipeline worldwide we sell all of our major product under trademark that we consider in the aggregate to be important to our operation trademark protection varies throughout the world with protection continuing in some country long the mark is used and in other country long it is registered registration are normally for fixed but renewable term patent licensesmost of our major product are not subject to significant license agreement the compound patent for cialis is the subject of license agreement with glaxosmithkline glaxo which assigns to exclusively all right in the compound the agreement call for royalty of single digit percentage of net sale the agreement is not subject to termination by glaxo for any reason other than material breach by lilly of the royalty obligation after substantial cure period for information on our license and collaboration agreement with with incyte corporation related to olumiant see item financial statement and supplementary data note collaboration patent challenge in the the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of commonly known the hatch waxman act authorizes the fda to approve generic version of innovative human pharmaceutical other than biologics without completion of safety and efficacy study complete new drug application nda by filing an abbreviated new drug application anda in an anda the generic manufacturer must demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic version and the nda approved drug not safety and efficacy establishing bioequivalence is generally straightforward and inexpensive for the generic company patent challenge the fda can not approve an anda until after the innovator patent expire however after the innovator ha marketed it product for four year generic manufacturer may file an anda alleging that one or more of the patent listed in the innovator nda are invalid or not infringed this allegation is commonly known paragraph iv certification the innovator must file suit the generic manufacturer to protect it patent the fda is then prohibited from approving the generic company application for month period which can be shortened or extended by the trial court judge hearing the patent challenge if one or more of the nda listed patent are challenged the first filer of paragraph iv certification may be entitled to day period of market exclusivity all other generic manufacturer generic manufacturer use paragraph iv certification extensively to challenge patent on innovative human pharmaceutical in addition generic company have shown willingness to launch at risk after receiving anda approval but before final resolution of their patent challenge we are currently in litigation with numerous generic manufacturer in hatch waxman litigation involving forteo alimta and effient among other product for more information on hatch waxman litigation involving the company see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency and item legal proceeding under the biologics price competition and innovation act of the bpci act the fda can not approve biosimilar application until data protection expires year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic however the act provide mechanism for competitor to challenge the validity of an innovator patent early year after initial marketing approval of the innovator biologic the patent litigation scheme under the bpci act is complex and interpretation of the bpci act is currently the subject of ongoing litigation specifically court have held that biosimilar applicant are not required to engage in the bpci act litigation scheme patent holder still have the right to bring suit under normal patent law procedure if biosimilar applicant attempt to commercialize product prior to patent expiration in addition there is procedure in patent law known ipr which allows any member of the public to file petition with the uspto seeking the review of any issued patent iprs are conducted before administrative patent judge in the uspto using lower standard of proof than used in federal district court in addition the challenged patent are not accorded the presumption of validity are in federal district court we are now seeing instance where generic drug company and some investment fund are attempting to invalidate our patent by filing ipr challenge in the uspto for more information see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency outside the the legal doctrine and process by which pharmaceutical patent can be challenged vary widely in recent year we have experienced an increase in patent challenge from generic manufacturer in many country outside the and we expect this trend to continue for more information on administrative challenge and litigation involving our alimta patent in europe and japan see item financial statement and supplementary data note contingency government regulation of our operationsour operation are regulated extensively by numerous national state and local agency the lengthy process of laboratory and clinical testing data analysis manufacturing development and regulatory review necessary for governmental approval is extremely costly and can significantly delay product introduction promotion marketing manufacturing and distribution of human pharmaceutical and animal health product are extensively regulated in all major world market we conduct extensive post marketing surveillance of the safety of the product we sell in addition our operation are subject to complex federal state local and foreign law and regulation concerning the environment occupational health and safety and privacy animal health product regulation address the administration of the product in or on the animal and in the case of food animal product the impact on human who consume the food well the impact on the environment at the production site compliance with the law and regulation affecting the manufacture and sale of current product and the discovery development and introduction of new product will continue to require substantial effort expense and capital investment of particular importance is the fda in the pursuant to the federal food drug and cosmetic act the fda ha jurisdiction over all of our human pharmaceutical product and certain animal health product in the and administers requirement covering the testing safety effectiveness manufacturing quality control distribution labeling marketing advertising dissemination of information and post marketing surveillance of those product the department of agriculture and the environmental protection agency also regulate some animal health product fda extensively regulates all aspect of manufacturing quality for human pharmaceutical under it current good manufacturing practice cgmp regulation outside the our product and operation are subject to similar regulatory requirement notably by the european medicine agency in the eu and the ministry of health labor and welfare in japan specific regulatory requirement vary from country to country we make substantial investment of capital and operating expense to implement comprehensive company wide quality system in our manufacturing product development and process development operation to ensure sustained compliance with cgmp and similar regulation however in the event we fail to adhere to these requirement in the future we could be subject to interruption in production fine and penalty and delay in new product approval certain of our product are manufactured by third party and their failure to comply with these regulation could adversely affect through failure to supply product to or delay in new product approval the marketing promotional and pricing practice of human pharmaceutical manufacturer well the manner in which manufacturer interact with purchaser and prescribers are subject to various other federal and state law including the federal anti kickback statute and the false claim act and state law governing kickback false claim unfair trade practice and consumer protection these law are administered by among others the department of justice doj the office of inspector general of the department of health and human service the federal trade commission the office of personnel management and state attorney general over the past several year the fda the doj and many of these other agency have increased their enforcement activity with respect to pharmaceutical company and increased the inter agency coordination of enforcement activity several claim brought by these agency against lilly and other company under these and other law have resulted in corporate criminal sanction and substantial civil settlement the foreign corrupt practice act of fcpa prohibits certain individual and entity including publicly traded company from promising offering or giving anything of value to foreign official with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage the fcpa also imposes specific recordkeeping and internal control requirement on publicly traded company noted outside the our business is heavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign official additionally in many country outside the the health care provider who prescribe human pharmaceutical are employed by the government and the purchaser of human pharmaceutical are government entity therefore our interaction with these prescribers and purchaser are subject to regulation under the fcpa in addition to the application and enforcement of the fcpa the various jurisdiction in which we operate and supply our product have law and regulation aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior in recent year several jurisdiction including china brazil and the united kingdom have enhanced their law and regulation in this area increased their enforcement activity and or increased the level of cross border coordination and information sharing it is possible that we could become subject to additional administrative and legal proceeding and action which could include claim for civil penalty including treble damage under the false claim act criminal sanction and administrative remedy including exclusion from federal and other health care program it is possible that an adverse outcome in future action could have material adverse impact on our consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position regulation and private payer action affecting human pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and access in the we are required to provide rebate to the federal government and respective state government on their purchase of our human pharmaceutical under state medicaid and medicaid managed care program minimum of percent plus adjustment for price increase over time and rebate to private payer who cover patient in certain type of health care facility that serve low income and uninsured patient known facility no rebate are required at this time in the medicare part physician and hospital outpatient program where reimbursement is set on an average selling price plus percent formula drug manufacturer are required to provide discount of percent of the cost of branded prescription drug for medicare part participant who are in the doughnut hole the coverage gap in medicare prescription drug coverage additionally an annual fee is imposed on pharmaceutical manufacturer and importer that sell branded prescription drug to specified government program rebate are also negotiated in the private sector we give rebate to private payer who provide prescription drug benefit to senior covered by medicare and to private payer who provide prescription drug benefit to their customer these rebate are affected by the introduction of competitive product and generic in the same class most international market we operate in an environment of government mandated cost containment program which may include price control international reference pricing to other country price discount and rebate therapeutic reference pricing to other often generic pharmaceutical choice restriction on physician prescription level and mandatory generic substitution globally public and private payer are increasingly restricting access to human pharmaceutical based on assessment of comparative effectiveness and value including through the establishment of formal health technology assessment process in addition third party organization including professional association academic institution and non profit entity associated with payer are conducting and publishing comparative effectiveness and cost benefit analysis on medicine the impact of which are uncertain at this time we can not predict the extent to which our business may be affected by these or other potential future legislative regulatory or payer development however in general we expect that state federal and international legislative and regulatory development could have further negative effect on pricing and reimbursement for our human pharmaceutical product research and developmentour commitment to research and development date back more than year we invest heavily in research and development we believe it is critical to our long term competitiveness at the end of we employed approximately people in human pharmaceutical and animal health research and development activity including substantial number of physician scientist holding graduate or postgraduate degree and highly skilled technical personnel this number decreased to approximately of january following voluntary early retirement program in the our research and development expense were billion in billion in and billion in our internal human pharmaceutical research focus primarily on the area of cancer diabetes neurodegeneration immunology and pain we have strong biotechnology research program with more than half of our clinical stage pipeline currently consisting of biologics in addition to discovering and developing nmes we seek to expand the value of existing product through new us formulation and therapeutic approach that provide additional value to patient to supplement our internal effort we collaborate with others including academic institution and research based pharmaceutical and biotechnology company we use the service of physician hospital medical school and other research organization worldwide to conduct clinical trial to establish the safety and effectiveness of our human pharmaceutical product we actively invest in external research and technology that hold the promise to complement and strengthen our own effort these investment can take many form including licensing arrangement co development and co marketing agreement co promotion arrangement joint venture and acquisition our elanco animal health innovation strategy is focused on identifying and developing promising technology and potential product from internal and external source to meet unmet veterinary food producer and pet owner need our animal health scientist also leverage discovery from our human health laboratory to develop product to enhance the health and wellbeing of farm animal and pet pharmaceutical development is time consuming expensive and risky on average only one out of many thousand of molecule discovered by researcher ultimately becomes an approved medicine the process from discovery to regulatory approval can take over decade drug candidate can fail at any stage of the process and even late stage drug candidate sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval or achieve commercial success the rate of innovation cycle leading to medical improvement over initial invention is accelerating this ha increased the risk that we opt not to develop late stage asset or that new product fail to achieve commercial success due to technical obsolescence displacement by follow on competitor product before the period of exclusivity ha ended after approval and launch of product we expend considerable resource on post marketing surveillance and additional clinical study to collect data and understand the benefit and potential risk of medicine they are used therapeutic the following describes in more detail the research and development process for human pharmaceutical product phase of new drug development discovery research phasethe earliest phase of new drug research and development the discovery phase can take many year scientist identify design and synthesize promising molecule screening ten of thousand of molecule for their effect on biological target that appear to play an important role in one or more disease target can be part of the body such protein receptor or gene or foreign such virus or bacteria some target have been proven to affect disease process but often the target is unproven and may later prove to be irrelevant to the disease or to yield insufficient clinical benefit molecule that have the desired effect on the target and meet other design criterion become candidate molecule and move to the next phase of development the probability of any one candidate molecule becoming commercial product is extremely low early development phasethe early development phase involves refining candidate molecule understanding to manufacture them efficiently and completing initial testing for safety and efficacy safety testing is done first in laboratory test and animal necessary to identify toxicity and other potential safety issue that would preclude use in human in general the first human test often referred to phase are conducted in small group of healthy volunteer or patient to ass safety and find the potential dosing range after safe dose range ha been established the drug is typically administered to small population of patient phase ii to look for initial sign of efficacy in treating the targeted disease or biomarkers of the disease and to continue to ass safety in parallel scientist work to identify safe effective and economical manufacturing process long term animal study continue to test for potential safety issue of the molecule that enter the early development phase approximately percent move on to the product phase the early development phase can take several year to complete product phaseproduct phase phase iii molecule have met initial safety requirement and typically shown initial evidence of efficacy result these molecule generally have higher likelihood of success the molecule are tested in much larger patient population to demonstrate efficacy to predetermined level of statistical significance and to continue to develop the safety profile these trial are generally global in nature and are designed to generate the data necessary to submit the molecule to regulatory agency for marketing approval the potential new drug is generally compared with existing competitive therapy placebo or both the resulting data is compiled and may be submitted to regulatory agency around the world phase iii testing varies by disease state but can often last from three to four year submission phaseonce molecule is submitted to regulatory agency the time to final marketing approval can vary from several month to several year depending on variable such the disease state the strength and complexity of the data presented the novelty of the target or compound and the time required for the agency to evaluate the submission there is no guarantee that potential medicine will receive marketing approval or that decision on marketing approval or indication will be consistent across geographic area believe our investment in research both internally and in collaboration with others have been rewarded by the large number of new molecule and new indication for existing molecule that we have in all stage of development we currently have approximately drug candidate across all stage of human testing and larger number of project in preclinical development among our new investigational molecule currently in the product phase of development or awaiting regulatory approval or launch are potential therapy for various cancer alzheimer disease pain migraine rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis and severe hypoglycemia we are studying many other drug candidate in the earlier stage of development in our chosen priority area we are also developing new us formulation or delivery method for many of these molecule well several currently marketed product see item management discussion and analysis executive overview late stage pipeline for more information on certain of our product candidate raw material and product supplymost of the principal material we use in our manufacturing operation are available from more than one source however we obtain certain raw material primarily from only one source in the event one of these supplier wa unable to provide the material or product we generally seek to maintain sufficient inventory to supply the market until an alternative source of supply can be implemented however in the event of an extended failure of supplier it is possible that we could experience an interruption in supply until we established new source or in some case implemented alternative process the majority of our revenue come from product produced in our own facility our principal active ingredient manufacturing occurs at site we own in the ireland and puerto rico finishing operation including formulation filling assembling delivery device manufacturing and packaging take place at number of site throughout the world we utilize third party for certain active ingredient manufacturing and finishing operation we manage our supply chain including our own facility contracted arrangement and inventory in way that should allow to meet all expected product demand while maintaining flexibility to reallocate manufacturing capacity to improve efficiency and respond to change in supply and demand to maintain stable supply of our product we use variety of technique including comprehensive quality system inventory management and back up site however human pharmaceutical and animal health production process are complex highly regulated and vary widely from product to product shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be very lengthy process requiring significant capital expenditure process modification and regulatory approval accordingly if we were to experience extended plant shutdown at one of our own facility extended failure of contract supplier or extraordinary unplanned increase in demand we could experience an interruption in supply of certain product or product shortage until production could be resumed or expanded quality assuranceour success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of our product and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness product quality arises from total commitment to quality in all part of our operation including research and development purchasing facility planning manufacturing distribution and dissemination of information about our medicine quality of production process involves strict control of ingredient equipment facility manufacturing

costly and highly uncertain we may not succeed in developing or acquiring commercially successful product sufficient in number or value to replace revenue of product that have lost or will soon lose intellectual property protection there are many difficulty and uncertainty inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new product there is high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring drug from the discovery phase to market can take over decade and often cost in excess of billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stage after substantial investment result most fund invested in research program will not generate financial return new product candidate that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concern inability to obtain necessary regulatory approval or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved us change in the relevant treatment standard or the availability of new or better competitive product difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture or infringement of the patent or intellectual property right of others regulatory agency continue to establish increasingly high hurdle for the efficacy and safety of new product delay and uncertainty in drug approval process can result in delay in product launch and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rate of new product we can not state with certainty when or whether our product now under development will be approved or launched whether if initially granted such approval will be maintained whether we will be able to develop license or otherwise acquire additional product candidate or product or whether our product once launched will be commercially successful we must maintain continuous flow of successful new product and successful new indication or brand

from an ongoing phase iii study will need to be provided this study is fully enrolled until availability of the full data the committee for medicinal product for human use will review the benefit and risk of lartruvo annually to determine whether the conditional marketing authorization can be maintained there are many difficulty and uncertainty inherent in human pharmaceutical research and development and the introduction of new product there is high rate of failure inherent in new drug discovery and development to bring drug from the discovery phase to market can take over decade and often cost in excess of billion failure can occur at any point in the process including in later stage after substantial investment result most fund invested in research program will not generate financial return new product candidate that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concern inability to obtain necessary regulatory approval or payer reimbursement or coverage limited scope of approved us change in the relevant treatment standard or the availability of new or better competitive product difficulty or excessive cost to manufacture or infringement of the patent or intellectual property right of others regulatory agency continue to establish increasingly high hurdle for the efficacy and safety of new product delay and uncertainty in drug approval process can result in delay in product launch and lost market opportunity in addition it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rate of new product we manage research and development spending across our portfolio of molecule and delay in or termination of any one project will not necessarily cause significant change in our total research and development spending due to the risk and uncertainty involved in the research and development process we can not reliably estimate the nature timing and cost of the effort necessary to complete the development of our research and development project can we reliably estimate the future potential revenue that will be generated from successful research and development project each project represents only portion of the overall pipeline and none is individually material to our consolidated research and development expense while we do accumulate certain research and development cost on project level for internal reporting purpose we must make significant cost estimation and allocation some of which rely on data that are neither reproducible nor validated through accepted control mechanism therefore we do not have sufficiently reliable data to report on total research and development cost by project by preclinical versus clinical spend or by therapeutic category other matterselanco animal healthwe are reviewing strategic alternative for elanco animal health our animal health segment including an initial public offering merger sale or retention of the business and will provide an update no later than the middle of patent matterswe depend on patent or other form of intellectual property protection for most of our revenue cash flow and earnings we lost patent exclusivity for the schizophrenia and bipolar mania indication for zyprexa in japan in december and april respectively generic version of zyprexa launched in japan in june the loss of exclusivity for zyprexa in japan ha caused rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product we lost our patent exclusivity for strattera in the in may and generic version of strattera were approved in the same month described in note to the consolidated financial statement following the settlement related to the compound patent challenge for effient generic product launched in the in the third quarter of the entry of generic competition for these product ha caused rapid and severe decline in revenue which will in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow our compound patent protection for cialis tadalafil and adcirca tadalafil expired in major european market and the in november however cialis is protected by unit dose patent in the where we expect exclusivity to end in late september at the earliest we expect that the entry of generic competition into these market following the loss of exclusivity will cause rapid and severe decline in for the affected product which will in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow additionally described in note to the consolidated financial statement the alimta vitamin regimen patent which provide with patent protection for alimta through june in japan and major european country and through may in the have been challenged in each of these jurisdiction our vitamin regimen patent have also been challenged in other smaller european jurisdiction our compound patent for alimta expired in the in january and expired in major european country and japan in december we expect that the entry of generic competition for alimta following the loss of effective patent protection will cause rapid and severe decline in revenue for the product which will in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow while the patent and trademark office recently ruled in our favor regarding the validity of the vitamin regimen patent the generic company which filed petition seeking inter partes review of our vitamin regimen patent have appealed these ruling further described in note to the consolidated financial statement we are aware that generic competitor have received approval to market generic version of pemetrexed in major european market and that generic product is currently on the market in at least one major european market in light of the united kingdom supreme court judgment finding infringement in the italy france and spain actavis ha withdrawn it previously launched at risk generic product from these market we will continue to seek to remove any generic pemetrexed product launched at risk in other european market notwithstanding our patent generic version of alimta were also approved in japan starting in february described in note to the consolidated financial statement we do not currently anticipate that generic version of alimta will proceed to pricing approval the compound patent for humalog insulin lispro ha expired in major market thus far the loss of compound patent protection for humalog ha not resulted in rapid and severe decline in revenue global regulator have different legal pathway to approve similar version of insulin lispro similar version of insulin lispro ha received approval in the and could launch soon we are also aware that competitor insulin lispro product ha launched in certain european market other manufacturer have effort underway to bring to market similar version of insulin lispro in the and europe while it is difficult to estimate the severity of the impact of similar insulin lispro product entering the market we do not expect rapid and severe decline in revenue however we expect competitive pressure and some loss of market share initially that would continue over time foreign currency exchange ratesas global company with substantial operation outside the we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rate primarily the dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound while we manage portion of these exposure through hedging and other risk management technique significant fluctuation in currency rate can have substantial impact either positive or negative on our revenue cost of sale and operating expense over the past two year we have seen significant foreign currency rate fluctuation between the dollar and several other foreign currency including the euro british pound and japanese yen while there is uncertainty in the future movement in foreign exchange rate these fluctuation could negatively impact our future consolidated result of operation and cash flow the impact of the venezuelan financial crisis including the significant deterioration of the bolívar resulted in charge of million in see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information related to the charge of december our venezuelan subsidiary represented de minimis portion of our consolidated asset and liability we continue to monitor other deteriorating economy and it is possible that additional charge may be recorded in the future any additional charge are not expected to have material adverse effect on our future consolidated result of operation affecting pharmaceutical pricing reimbursement and accessunited statesin the public concern over access to and affordability of pharmaceutical continues to drive the regulatory and legislative debate these policy and political issue increase the risk that tax fee rebate or other federal and state measure may be enacted key health policy proposal affecting biopharmaceuticals include reduction in biologic data exclusivity modification to medicare part and language that would allow the department of health and human service to negotiate price for biologics and drug in medicare proposal that would require biopharmaceutical manufacturer to disclose proprietary drug pricing information and state level proposal related to prescription drug price and reducing the cost of pharmaceutical purchased by government health care program several state enacted legislation in related to prescription drug pricing transparency saving projected under these proposal are targeted mean to fund both health care expenditure and non health care initiative or to manage federal and state budget the bipartisan budget act enacted on february will require manufacturer of brand name drug biologics and biosimilars to pay percent discount in the medicare part coverage gap up from the current percent discount this increase in coverage gap discount will be effective beginning in in the private sector consolidation and integration among healthcare provider is also major factor in the competitive marketplace for human pharmaceutical health plan pharmaceutical benefit manager wholesaler and other supply chain stakeholder have been consolidating into fewer larger entity thus enhancing their purchasing strength and importance payer typically maintain formulary which specify coverage the condition under which drug are included on plan formulary and reimbursement the associated out of pocket cost to the consumer formulary placement can lead to reduced usage of drug for the relevant patient population due to coverage restriction such prior authorization and formulary exclusion or due to reimbursement limitation which result in higher consumer out of pocket cost such non preferred co pay tier increased co insurance level and higher deductible consequently pharmaceutical company compete for formulary placement not only on the basis of product attribute such greater efficacy fewer side effect or greater patient ease of use but also by providing rebate price is an increasingly important factor in formulary decision particularly in treatment area in which the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable these downward pricing pressure could negatively affect future consolidated result of operation and cash flow the main coverage expansion provision of the affordable care act aca are currently in effect through both state based exchange and the expansion of medicaid trend ha been the prevalence of benefit design containing high out of pocket cost for patient particularly for pharmaceutical in addition to the coverage expansion many employer in the commercial market driven in part by aca change such the implementation of the excise tax on employer sponsored health care coverage for which there is an excess benefit the so called cadillac tax continue to evaluate strategy such private exchange and wider use of consumer driven health plan to reduce their healthcare liability over time repealing and replacing the aca remains priority for president trump and congress provision included in final legislation could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow at the same time the broader paradigm shift towards performance based reimbursement and the launch of several value based purchasing initiative have placed demand on the pharmaceutical industry to offer product with proven real world outcome data and favorable economic profile internationalinternational operation also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulation cost containment measure exist in number of country including additional price control and mechanism to limit reimbursement for our product such policy are expected to increase in impact and reach given the pressure on national and regional health care budget that come from growing aging population and ongoing economic challenge in addition government in many emerging market are becoming increasingly active in expanding health care system offering given the budget challenge of increasing health care coverage for citizen policy may be proposed that promote generic and biosimilars only and reduce current and future access to branded human pharmaceutical product matterswe are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction change in the relevant tax law regulation administrative practice principle and interpretation could adversely affect our future effective tax rate the recently enacted tax reform legislation significantly revising tax law and number of other country are actively considering or enacting tax change other organization such the organisation for economic co operation and development and the european commission are active regarding tax related matter which could influence international tax policy in country in which we operate while outcome of these initiative continue to develop and remain uncertain modification to key element of the or international tax framework could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation and cash flow in december the president of the signed into law the tax cut and job act tax act the tax act includes significant change to the corporate income tax system such the reduction in the corporate income tax rate transition to territorial tax system change to business related exclusion deduction and credit and modification to international tax provision including one time repatriation transition tax also known the toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires that the income tax accounting effect from change in tax law or tax rate be recognized in continuing operation in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change these effect include among other thing re measuring deferred tax asset and liability evaluating deferred tax asset for valuation allowance and assessing the impact of the toll tax and certain other provision of the tax act we were not able to completely gather analyze and compute all impact of the tax act therefore the estimated income tax expense of billion that we recorded in december related to the tax act is provisional amount based upon reasonable estimate and may change upon completion of our calculation see note to the consolidated financial statement in addition change in our interpretation of the new tax law along with subsequent regulation interpretation and guidance that have been and may be issued may materially affect the estimate and assumption used in recording the change to our federal and state income tax expense that resulted from the tax act refer to result of operation financial condition for discussion of the impact of the tax act on our liquidity acquisitionssee note to the consolidated financial statement for discussion regarding our recent acquisition of business and asset including our acquisition of boehringer ingelheim vetmedica inc feline canine and rabies vaccine portfolio and other related asset bivivp completed on january in an all cash transaction for million our acquisition of colucid completed on march for cash purchase

respectively see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail of december total debt wa billion an increase of billion compared with billion at december the increase wa primarily

the consolidated financial statement for additional detail we believe that amount accessible through existing commercial paper market should be adequate to fund short term borrowing need for the consecutive year we distributed dividend to our shareholder dividend of per share and per share were paid in and respectively in the fourth quarter of effective for the dividend to be paid in the first quarter of the quarterly dividend wa increased to per share resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share capital expenditure of billion during were million more than in we expect capital expenditure to be approximately billion in we repurchased million of share under the billion share repurchase program previously announced in october see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail see result of operation executive overview other matter patent matter for information regarding recent and upcoming loss of patent protection pursuant to the tax act the will transition to territorial tax system effective january therefore we expect that future repatriation of cash from our foreign subsidiary to the will result in immaterial or no tax payment this change in tax law provides with additional liquidity in the without the requirement to pay tax existed prior to the enactment of the new tax law we believe cash provided by operating activity along with available cash and cash equivalent should be sufficient to fund our normal operating need including installment payment of the toll tax dividend paid to shareholder share repurchase and capital expenditure over the course of and we plan to deploy the additional liquidity created from the tax law across our capital allocation priority including funding our existing marketed product and pipeline including capital investment in line with our current strategy investing in business development to bolster our future growth prospect returning cash to shareholder via increase to the dividend and share buyback and reducing our gross debt both domestically and abroad we continue to monitor the potential impact of the economic environment the creditworthiness of our wholesaler and other customer including foreign government backed agency and supplier the uncertain impact of health care legislation and various international government funding level in the normal course of business our operation are exposed to fluctuation in interest rate and currency value these fluctuation can vary the cost of financing investing and operating we address portion of these risk through controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instrument the objective of controlling these risk is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuation in interest and currency exchange rate all derivative activity are for purpose other than trading our primary interest rate risk exposure result from change in short term dollar interest rate in an effort to manage interest rate exposure we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt position and may enter into interest rate derivative to help maintain that balance based on our overall interest rate exposure at december and including derivative and other interest rate risk sensitive instrument hypothetical percent change in interest rate applied to the fair value of the instrument of december and respectively would not have material impact on earnings cash flow or fair value of interest rate risk sensitive instrument over one year period foreign currency risk exposure result from fluctuating currency exchange rate primarily the dollar against the euro japanese yen and british pound and the swiss franc against the euro we face foreign currency exchange exposure when we enter into transaction arising from subsidiary trade and loan payable and receivables denominated in foreign currency we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the result of our global operation to the dollar at exchange rate that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period we may enter into foreign currency forward or option derivative contract to reduce the effect of fluctuating currency exchange rate principally the euro the japanese yen and the british pound our corporate risk management policy outline the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposure gain and loss on these derivative contract offset in part the impact of currency fluctuation on the existing asset and liability we periodically analyze the fair value of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contract to determine their sensitivity to change in foreign exchange rate hypothetical percent change in exchange rate primarily against the dollar applied to the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency derivative contract of december and would not have material impact on earnings cash flow or financial position over one year period this sensitivity analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in exchange rate would have on the underlying foreign currency denominated transaction balance sheet arrangement and contractual obligationswe have no off balance sheet arrangement that have material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have material future effect on our financial condition change in financial condition revenue or expense result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource we acquire and collaborate on potential product still in development and enter into research and development arrangement with third party that often require milestone and royalty payment to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future event linked to the success of the asset in development milestone payment may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product approval for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency or upon the achievement of certain sale level if required by the arrangement we may make royalty payment based upon percentage of the sale of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained because of the contingent nature of these payment they are not included in the table of contractual obligation below individually these arrangement are generally not material in any one annual reporting period however if milestone for multiple product covered by these arrangement were reached in the same reporting period the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the result of operation or cash flow in that period see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail these arrangement often give the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product which would allow to avoid making the contingent payment however we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves milestone objective we also note that from business perspective we view these payment positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flow from sale of product current noncancelable contractual obligation that will require future cash payment are follows payment due by period dollar in million total le year more yearslong term debt including interest payment lease operating obligation tax act one time toll tax provisional long term liability reflected on our balance sheet our long term debt obligation include both our expected principal and interest obligation and our interest rate swap we used the interest rate forward curve at december to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instrument and swap we have included the following purchase obligation consisting primarily of all open purchase order of december some of these purchase order may be cancelable however for purpose of this disclosure we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligation contractual payment obligation with each of our significant vendor which are noncancelable and are not contingent the tax act provides an election to taxpayer subject to the toll tax to make payment over an eight year period we intend to make this election therefore we have included future toll tax payment accordingly the amount shown reflect the provisional amount of toll tax recorded at december these amount are subject to change see note to the consolidated financial statement we have included long term liability consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirement and other post employment benefit liability we excluded long term income tax payable of million because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of future cash outflow associated with those liability the contractual obligation table is current of december we expect the amount of these obligation to change materially over time new contract are initiated and existing contract are completed terminated or modified application of critical accounting estimatesin preparing our financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the we must often make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue expense and related disclosure some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and consequently actual result could differ from those estimate for any given individual estimate or assumption we make it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same fact and circumstance could develop different estimate we believe that given current fact and circumstance it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or liquidity for the period presented in this report discussed in income tax later in this section we were unable to completely ass all impact of the tax act therefore the estimate that we recorded is provisional amount based upon reasonable estimate and may change upon completion of our calculation our most critical accounting estimate have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below revenue recognition and sale return rebate and discount accrualswe recognize revenue from sale of product at the time title of good pass to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risk and reward of ownership provision for return rebate and discount are established in the same period the related sale are recorded return background and uncertaintieswe regularly review the supply level of our significant product sold to major wholesaler in the and in major market outside the primarily by reviewing periodic inventory report supplied by our major wholesaler and available prescription volume information for our product or alternative approach we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory level at an average of approximately one month or le on consistent basis across our product portfolio cause of unusual wholesaler buying pattern include actual or anticipated product supply issue weather pattern anticipated change in the transportation network redundant holiday stocking and change in wholesaler business operation in the the current structure of our arrangement doe not provide an incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides with data on inventory level at our wholesaler when we believe wholesaler purchasing pattern have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the revenue of major product compared with underlying demand we disclose this in our product revenue discussion if we believe the amount is material to the product revenue trend however we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking in the retail channel wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically ha not caused any material change in the rate of actual product return when sale occur we estimate reserve for future product return related to those sale this estimate is based on several factor including historical return rate expiration date by product on average approximately month after the initial sale of product to our customer and estimated level of inventory in the wholesale and retail channel among others well any other specifically identified anticipated return due to known factor such the loss of patent exclusivity product recall and discontinuance or changing competitive environment we maintain return policy that allows pharmaceutical customer to return product for dating issue within specified period prior to and subsequent to the product expiration date following the loss of exclusivity for patent dependent product we expect to experience an elevated level of product return product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channel expires adjustment to the return reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimate to our assumption which would have an impact on our consolidated result of operation we record the return amount deduction to arrive at our net product sale once the product is returned it is destroyed actual product return have been le than percent of our net revenue over the past three year and have not fluctuated significantly percentage of revenue sale rebate and discount background and uncertaintieswe establish sale rebate and discount accrual in the same period the related sale the rebate and discount amount are recorded deduction to arrive at our net product revenue sale rebate and discount that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include managed care medicare medicaid chargebacks long term care hospital patient assistance program and various other program we base these accrual primarily upon our historical rebate and discount payment made to our customer segment group and the provision of current rebate and discount contract the largest of our sale rebate and discount amount are rebate associated with sale covered by managed care medicare and medicaid contract in determining the appropriate accrual amount we consider our historical managed care medicare and medicaid rebate payment by product percentage of our historical sale well any significant change in sale trend patent expiry and product launch an evaluation of the current managed care medicare and medicaid contract the percentage of our product that are sold via managed care medicare and medicaid contract and our product pricing although we accrue liability for managed care medicare and medicaid rebate at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped the managed care medicare and medicaid rebate related to that sale is paid up to six month later because of this time lag in any particular period our rebate adjustment may incorporate revision of accrual for several period most of our rebate outside the are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period the related sale in some large european country government rebate are based on the anticipated budget for pharmaceutical payment in the country best estimate of these rebate updated governmental authority revise budgeted deficit is recognized in the same period the related sale if our estimate are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical cost incurred by the government we adjust our rebate reserve statement impactwe believe that our accrual for sale return rebate and discount are reasonable and appropriate based on current fact and circumstance our global rebate and discount liability are included in sale rebate and discount on our consolidated balance sheet our global sale return liability is included in other current liability and other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet of december percent change in our global sale return rebate and discount liability would have led to an approximate million effect on our income before income tax the portion of our global sale return rebate and discount liability resulting from sale of our product in the wa percent and percent of december and respectively the following represents roll forward of our most significant pharmaceutical sale return rebate and discount liability balance including managed care medicare and medicaid dollar in million return rebate and discount liability beginning of year of net sale due to sale return discount and rebate payment of discount and rebate sale return rebate and discount liability end of year adjustment of the estimate for these return rebate and discount to actual result were approximately percent of consolidated net sale for each of the year presented product litigation liability and other contingenciesbackground and uncertaintiesproduct litigation liability and other contingency are by their nature uncertain and based upon complex judgment and probability the factor we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserve and other contingent liability amount include the merit and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation case the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussion if any in addition we accrue for certain product liability claim incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate reasonable estimate of their cost based primarily on historical claim experience and data regarding product usage we accrue legal defense cost expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingency when both probable and reasonably estimable we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for period covered by insurance in assessing our insurance coverage we consider the policy coverage limit and exclusion the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company the financial condition of the insurer and the possibility of and length of time for collection due to very restrictive market for product liability insurance we are self insured for product liability loss for all our currently marketed product in addition to insurance coverage we also consider any third party indemnification to which we are entitled including the nature of the indemnification the financial condition of the indemnifying party and the possibility of and length of time for collection the litigation accrual and environmental liability and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on gross basis liability and asset respectively on our consolidated balance sheet impairment of indefinite lived and long lived assetsbackground and uncertaintieswe review the carrying value of long lived asset both intangible and tangible for potential impairment on periodic basis and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we identify impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the asset or asset group to it carrying value if an impairment is identified loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset net book value over it fair value and the cost basis is adjusted goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when certain impairment indicator are present when required comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of asset is performed to determine the amount of any impairment method may be used to determine the estimated fair value of acquired ipr all of which require multiple assumption we utilize the income method described in note to the consolidated financial statement for acquired ipr asset the risk of failure ha been factored into the fair value measure and there can be no certainty that these asset ultimately will yield successful product discussed previously in result of operation executive overview late stage pipeline the nature of the pharmaceutical business is high risk and requires that we invest in large number of project to maintain successful portfolio of approved product such it is likely that some acquired ipr asset will become impaired in the future estimate of future cash flow based on what we believe to be reasonable and supportable assumption and projection require management judgment actual result could vary materially from these estimate retirement benefit assumptionsbackground and uncertaintiesdefined benefit pension plan and retiree health benefit plan cost include assumption for the discount rate expected return on plan asset and retirement age these assumption have significant effect on the amount reported in addition to the analysis below see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding our retirement benefit annually we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan asset in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan we use an actuarially determined plan specific yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instrument to determine the discount rate in evaluating the expected return on plan asset we consider many factor with primary analysis of current and projected market condition asset return and asset allocation approximately percent of which are growth investment and the view of leading financial adviser and economist we may also review our historical assumption compared with actual result well the discount rate and expected return on plan asset of other company where applicable in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption we consider the retirement age of our past employee eligible for pension and medical benefit together with our expectation of future retirement age financial statement impactif the discount rate for the defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan plan were to change by quarter percentage point income before income tax would change by million of january we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost component of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan cost prior to this change the service and interest cost were determined using single weighted average discount rate based on yield curve of high quality fixed income debt instrument used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period this new method us the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve to the projected cash outflow of our obligation the new method provides more precise measure of interest and service cost by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flow and the specific spot yield curve rate the change doe not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost is recorded in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss we accounted for this change in estimate prospectively beginning in if the expected return on plan asset for plan were to change by quarter percentage point income before income tax would change by million if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retiree for plan were adjusted by one year our income before income tax would be affected by million the plan including puerto rico represent approximately percent and percent of the total projected benefit obligation and total plan asset respectively at december income taxesbackground and uncertaintieswe prepare and file tax return based upon our interpretation of tax law and regulation and record estimate based on these judgment and interpretation in the normal course of business our tax return are to examination by various taxing authority which may result in future tax interest and penalty assessment by these authority inherent uncertainty exist in estimate of many tax position due to change in tax law resulting from legislation regulation and or concluded through the various jurisdiction tax court system we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution the amount of unrecognized tax benefit is adjusted for change in fact and circumstance for example adjustment could result from significant amendment to existing tax law the issuance of regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of tax examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we have recorded valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax asset primarily those that have been generated from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain taxing jurisdiction in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax asset we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategy in the jurisdiction associated with these carryforwards where history doe not support such an assumption implementation of tax planning strategy to recover these deferred tax asset or future income generation in these jurisdiction could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowance and reduction of income tax expense the tax act wa enacted in december and introduced numerous significant change to the corporate income tax system in accordance with gaap we recorded an estimate of the change to our federal and state income tax expense that resulted from the tax act which included re measuring deferred tax asset and liability evaluating deferred tax asset for valuation allowance and assessing the impact of the toll tax and certain other provision of the tax act since we were unable to completely ass all impact of the tax act the estimate that we recorded is provisional amount based upon reasonable estimate and may change upon completion of our calculation refer to result of operation executive overview other matter tax matter and note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion on the tax act assimilation of the tax act will be ongoing we continue to analyze the new law and future directive are issued including regulation interpretation and guidance which may materially affect the estimate and assumption used in recording the change to federal and state income tax expense financial statement impactas of december percent change in the amount of the provisional charge related to the tax act uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance would result in change in net income of million million and million respectively acquisitionsbackground and uncertaintiesto determine whether acquisition or licensing transaction should be accounted for business combination or an asset acquisition we make certain judgment which include assessing whether the acquired set of activity and asset would meet the definition of business under the relevant accounting rule if the acquired set of activity and asset meet the definition of business asset acquired and liability assumed are required to be recorded at their respective fair value of the acquisition date the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net asset where applicable is recorded goodwill if the acquired set of activity and asset doe not meet the definition of business the transaction is recorded an acquisition of asset and therefore any acquired ipr that doe not have an alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date and goodwill is not recorded refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the judgment made in determining estimated fair value assigned to asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination well estimated asset life can materially affect our consolidated result of the fair value of intangible asset including acquired ipr are determined using information available near the acquisition date based on expectation and assumption that are deemed reasonable by management depending on the fact and circumstance we may deem it necessary to engage an independent valuation expert to assist in valuing significant asset and liability the fair value of identifiable intangible asset are primarily determined using an income method described in note to the consolidated financial statement the fair value of any contingent consideration liability that result from business combination is determined using market approach based on quoted market value significant other observable input for identical or comparable asset or liability or discounted cash flow analysis estimating the fair value of contingent consideration requires the use of significant estimate and judgment including but not limited to revenue and the discount rate financial statement impactas of december percent change in the contingent consideration liability would result in change in income before income tax of million legal and regulatory matter information relating to certain legal proceeding can be found in note to the consolidated financial statement and is incorporated here by reference financial expectation for for the full year of we expect eps to

period the related sale are recognized in arrangement involving the delivery of more than one element research and development marketing and selling manufacturing and distribution each required deliverable is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies separate unit of accounting our determination is based on whether the deliverable ha standalone value to the customer if deliverable doe not

initial application in retained earnings we applied the latter approach this standard wa effective january and we adopted on that date our evaluation of our contract subject to this standard is complete and we do not expect the application of the new standard to these contract to have material impact to our consolidated statement of operation or balance sheet at initial implementation we are

same financial statement line item or item other compensation cost arising from service rendered by pertinent employee the other component of net benefit cost will be presented separately from the

significant market we and boehringer ingelheim share equally the ongoing development cost commercialization cost and agreed upon gross margin for any product resulting from the collaboration we record our portion of the gross margin associated with boehringer ingelheim compound collaboration and other revenue we record our sale of basaglar to third party net product revenue with the payment made to boehringer ingelheim for their portion of the gross margin recorded cost of sale for all compound under this collaboration we record our portion of the development and commercialization cost research and development expense and marketing selling and administrative expense respectively each company is entitled to potential performance payment depending on the sale of the molecule it contributes to the collaboration these performance payment result in the owner of the molecule retaining greater share of the agreed upon gross margin of that product subject to achieving these threshold in given period our reported revenue for trajenta and jardiance may be reduced by any performance payment we make related to these product similarly performance payment we may receive related to basaglar effectively reduce boehringer ingelheim share of the gross margin which reduces our cost of sale the following table summarizes our collaboration and other revenue recognized with respect to the

interest or principal payment for any of our debt security activity related to our investment portfolio substantially all of which related to available for sale security wa follows from sale gross gain on gross loss on gain and loss on sale of investment are computed based upon specific identification of the initial cost adjusted for any other than temporary decline in fair value that were recorded in earnings receivable factoring arrangementswe have entered into account receivable factoring agreement with financial institution to sell certain of our non account receivable these transaction are accounted for sale and result in reduction in account receivable because the agreement transfer effective control over and risk related to the receivables to the buyer our factoring agreement do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectibility and we do not retain any interest in the underlying account receivable once sold we derecognized million and million of account receivable of december and respectively under these factoring arrangement the cost of factoring such account receivable on our consolidated result of operation for the year ended december and wa not material note goodwill and other intangiblesgoodwillgoodwill by segment at december wa follows pharmaceutical product goodwill result from excess consideration in business combination over the fair value of identifiable net asset acquired goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment at least annually and when impairment indicator are present when required comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying amount including goodwill is used to determine the amount of any impairment see note for discussion of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of bivip the remaining change in goodwill for the animal health segment is the result of foreign exchange translation adjustment no impairment occurred with respect to the carrying value of goodwill for the year ended december and other intangiblesthe component of intangible asset other than goodwill at december were follows gross accumulatedamortization carryingamount net carryingamount gross accumulatedamortization carryingamount netfinite lived intangible asset marketed product finite lived intangible lived intangible asset acquired in process research and intangible product consist of the amortized cost of the right to asset acquired in business combination and approved for marketing in significant global jurisdiction europe and japan and capitalized milestone payment for transaction other than business combination we capitalize milestone payment incurred at or after the product ha obtained regulatory approval for marketing other finite lived intangible consist primarily of the amortized cost of licensed platform technology that have alternative future us in research and development manufacturing technology and customer relationship from business combination acquired ipr consists of the related cost capitalized adjusted for subsequent impairment if any the cost of acquired ipr project acquired directly in transaction other than business combination are if the project have an alternative future use otherwise they are expensed immediately the fair value of acquired ipr project acquired in business combination are capitalized other intangible asset several method may be used to determine the estimated fair value of other intangible acquired in business combination we utilize the income method which is level fair value measurement and applies probability weighting that considers the risk of development and commercialization to the estimated future net cash flow that are derived from projected revenue and estimated cost these projection are based on factor such relevant market size patent protection historical pricing of similar product and expected industry trend the estimated future net cash flow are then discounted to the present value using an appropriate discount rate this analysis is performed for each asset independently the acquired ipr asset are treated indefinite lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the project at which time the asset are tested for impairment and amortized over the remaining useful life or written off appropriate see note for further discussion of intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of bivip and note for additional discussion of recent capitalized milestone payment other indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually and when impairment indicator are present finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment when an indicator of impairment is present when required comparison of fair value to the carrying amount of asset is performed to determine the amount of any impairment when determining the fair value of indefinite lived acquired ipr well the fair value of finite lived intangible asset for impairment testing purpose we utilize the income method discussed above during the year we had animal health intangible impairment charge of million comprised of million impairment of finite lived intangible asset and million impairment of indefinite lived intangible asset charged to asset impairment restructuring and other special charge on the consolidated statement of operation these impairment were related to competitive pressure for certain companion animal product resulting in reduction of revenue well lower projected revenue for posilac rbst no material impairment occurred with respect to the carrying value of other intangible asset for the year ended december and intangible asset with finite life are capitalized and are amortized over their estimated useful life ranging from to year of december the remaining weighted average amortization period for finite lived intangible asset is approximately year amortization expense related to finite lived intangible asset wa follows expense estimated amortization expense for each of the next five year associated with our finite lived intangible asset of december is follows amortization expense expense is included in either cost of sale marketing selling and administrative or research and development depending on the nature of the intangible asset being amortized property and equipmentproperty and equipment is stated on the basis of cost provision for depreciation of building and equipment are computed generally by the straight line method at rate based on their estimated useful life to year for building and to year for equipment we review the carrying value of long lived asset for potential impairment on periodic basis and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the asset to it carrying value if an impairment is identified loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset net book value over it fair value and the cost basis is adjusted at december property and equipment consisted of the following in accumulated depreciation property and equipment net expense related to property and equipment and rental expense for all lease including contingent rental not material wa follows expense future minimum rental commitment under non cancelable operating lease are

the asset of the trust were not used to fund any of our obligation under these employee benefit plan during the year ended december and note income tax actin december the president of the signed into law the tax cut and job act tax act the tax act includes significant change to the corporate income tax system such the reduction in the corporate income tax rate from percent to percent transition to territorial tax system change to business related exclusion deduction and credit and modification to international tax provision including one time repatriation transition tax also known the toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings gaap requires that the income tax accounting effect from change in tax law or tax rate be recognized in continuing operation in the reporting period that includes the enactment date of the change these effect include among other thing re measuring deferred tax asset and liability evaluating deferred tax asset for valuation allowance and assessing the impact of the toll tax and certain other provision of the tax act our accounting for the tax effect of the enactment of the tax act wa not complete of december however in certain case described below we have made reasonable estimate in other case we have not been able to make reasonable estimate and continued to account for those item based on our existing accounting model under asc income tax and the provision of the tax law that were in effect immediately prior to enactment for the item for which we were able to determine reasonable estimate we recognized provisional amount of billion which is included component of income tax expense from continuing operation this amount represents approximately billion attributable to the toll tax partially offset by the change in deferred tax resulting from the transition to territorial tax system including the re measurement of deferred tax our estimate of the impact of the tax act is based upon our analysis and interpretation of currently available information uncertainty remain regarding the impact of the tax act due to future regulatory and rulemaking process prospect of additional corrective or supplemental legislation and potential trade or other litigation these uncertainty along with our completion of the calculation and potential change in our initial assumption new information becomes available could cause the actual charge to ultimately differ materially from the provisional amount recorded in related to the enactment of the tax act we have included provisional amount based upon reasonable estimate for the following toll taxthe tax act imposes one time toll tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profit at two different tax rate with higher tax rate applied to amount held in cash and liquid asset we have not yet completed our calculation of the item composing the toll tax including the total post of our foreign subsidiary and amount held cash and liquid asset therefore we recorded provisional amount of federal and state income tax based upon reasonable estimate the amount is also subject to change we assimilate the new law and subsequent regulation interpretation and guidance they are issued additionally company have the option to elect to pay the toll tax in eight installment provisional amount were recorded to short term and long term income tax payable these amount may change when the toll tax calculation is complete the impact to state income tax expense is also subject to change based upon revision ultimately made to the toll tax calculation change in our assumption related to state taxation of the income used to calculate the toll tax and future guidance that may be issued re measurement of deferred tax asset and liabilitiesthe tax act reduced the corporate income tax rate from percent to percent effective january gaap requires deferred tax asset and liability to be measured at the enacted tax rate expected to apply when these temporary difference are to be realized or settled result we determined the amount recorded to income tax expense in continuing operation by using temporary difference that approximated our deferred tax balance at the date of enactment considering any material transaction that occurred between the enactment date and december we assessed the need for valuation allowance result of re measuring existing temporary difference and considering tax attribute balance change recorded to valuation allowance are also reflected in income tax expense from continuing operation re measurement of the deferred tax asset and liability in addition to assessment of valuation allowance is subject to uncertainty given that approximated balance were utilized for the enactment date and tax accounting method change may be considered under gaap the effect of change in tax law is recorded component of the income tax expense related to continuing operation in the period of enactment adjusting the deferred tax for temporary difference that arose from item of income or loss that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income through continuing operation result in disproportionate tax effect in aocl asu income statement reporting comprehensive income reclassification of certain tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income allows company to reclassify the stranded tax effect that result from the tax act from aocl to retained earnings with early adoption permitted we early adopted the standard and recorded provisional amount see note unremitted foreign earnings executive compensation and uncertain tax positionsa provisional amount wa recorded to reflect foreign withholding tax and state income tax for future repatriation of non indefinitely reinvested earnings no additional amount wa recorded for outside basis difference in our foreign subsidiary we have made assumption related to the creditability of those foreign withholding tax therefore these amount may change upon completion of our calculation the tax act includes change to the taxation of executive compensation we have recorded provisional amount based upon our estimate interpretation of the new law and external guidance the provisional amount recorded could change based upon revision to any of those assumption relative to the provisional amount recorded result of the tax act we also recorded provisional amount related to change in uncertain tax position future change to the provisional amount recorded in addition to future change to income tax expense for item for which reasonable estimate were not made could change the recorded amount the estimate and assumption used to record provisional amount for uncertain tax position could also change upon completion of our calculation and upon revision related to subsequent regulation interpretation and guidance if and when issued we could not make reasonable estimate therefore we did not record provisional amount for the following item the tax act includes an international tax provision for the taxation of global intangible low taxed income gilti effective january question have surfaced to whether the income tax related to gilti should be recorded in the period the tax arises or whether deferred tax should be established for basis difference that upon reversal might be subject to gilti asc doe not provide clear guidance on this topic and company are allowed to make an accounting policy election we have recorded no provisional amount for gilti deferred tax more time is needed to analyze the data in order to make an accounting policy election the tax act includes significant change to the international tax provision including gilti base erosion anti abuse tax and foreign derived intangible income for purpose of analyzing valuation allowance for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we recorded no provisional amount for release of valuation allowance more time is needed to analyze the data we will continue to ass the impact of the tax act on our consolidated financial statement during the measurement period which should be no longer than one year from the tax act enactment date discussed above the tax act included numerous change to the tax system we have made good faith effort to identify item for which no reasonable estimate wa made however additional item requiring accounting may be identified we complete our analysis and new information becomes available therefore no reasonable estimate ha been made for item in the new tax law that have not been identified deferred tax are recognized for the future tax effect of temporary difference between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax law and rate we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution following is the composition of income tax expense federal tax act total current tax foreign tax act provisional total deferred tax benefit expense income tax component of our deferred tax asset and liability of december are follows tax asset compensation and benefit loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards and of intangible return comprehensive loss on hedging gross deferred tax allowance total deferred tax tax liability inventory intangible property and equipment prepaid employee benefit financial instrument unremitted earnings total deferred tax liability deferred tax asset liability net deferred tax asset and liability reflect the provisional impact of re measurement resulting from the tax act the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance amount for federal and state net operating loss and tax credit shown above have been reduced for difference between financial reporting and tax return filing at december based on filed tax return we have tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks of million available to reduce future income tax million if unused will expire by the remaining portion of the tax credit carryforwards is related to federal tax credit of million international tax credit of million and state tax credit of million all of which are substantially reserved at december based on filed tax return we had net operating loss and other carryforwards for international and federal income tax purpose of billion million will expire by million will expire between and and billion of the carryforwards will never expire net operating loss and other carryforwards for international and federal income tax purpose are partially reserved deferred tax asset related to state net operating loss of million and other state carryforwards of million are fully reserved domestic and puerto rican company contributed approximately percent percent and percent for the year ended december and respectively to consolidated income before income tax we have subsidiary operating in puerto rico under tax incentive grant effective through the end of the tax act introduces international tax provision that fundamentally change the taxation of foreign earnings result tax previously accrued on unremitted foreign earnings have been reversed and provisional amount ha been recorded to reflect amount for foreign withholding tax and state income tax that would be owed upon future distribution of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiary that are not indefinitely reinvested at december due to the tax act substantially all of the unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiary are considered to not be indefinitely reinvested for continued use in our foreign operation for the amount considered to be indefinitely reinvested the amount of foreign withholding tax and state income tax that would be owed upon distribution is immaterial payment of income tax were follows payment of income tax tax act provides an election to taxpayer subject to the toll tax to make payment over an eight year period with the first payment due on the original filing due date of the federal income tax return we intend to make this election therefore future cash payment of income tax will include the toll tax installment following is reconciliation of the income tax expense applying the federal statutory rate to income before income tax to reported income tax expense tax at the federal statutory tax rate deduct international operation including puerto rico general business credit tax act non deductible acquired ipr colucid note other tax reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefit is follows balance at january based on tax position related to the current for tax position of prior for tax position of prior year settlement lapse of statute of limitation change related to the impact of foreign currency ending balance at december total amount of unrecognized tax benefit that if recognized would affect our effective tax rate wa million and million at december and respectively we file income tax return in the federal jurisdiction and various state local and non jurisdiction we are no longer subject to federal state and local or non income tax examination in most major taxing jurisdiction for year before the examination of tax year commenced during the fourth quarter of in december we executed closing agreement with the internal revenue service which effectively settled certain matter for tax year accordingly we reduced our gross uncertain tax position by approximately million in during we effectively settled the remaining matter related to tax year result of this resolution our gross uncertain tax position were further reduced by approximately million and our consolidated result of operation benefited from an immaterial reduction in income tax expense during we made cash payment of approximately million related to tax year after application of available tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks the examination of tax year began in while we believe it is reasonably possible that this audit could reach resolution within the next month the irs examination of tax year remains ongoing therefore it is not possible to reasonably estimate the change to unrecognized tax benefit and the related future cash flow we recognize both accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we recognized income tax benefit expense related to interest and penalty follows tax benefit expense december and our accrual for the payment of interest and penalty totaled million and million respectively note retirement benefitswe use measurement date of december to develop the change in benefit obligation change in plan asset funded status and amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at december for our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan which were follows defined benefitpension plan retiree healthbenefit plan in benefit obligation benefit obligation at beginning

service cost benefit have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension cost and are included in aocl at december the workforce reduction plan initiated in included curtailment loss of million and special termination benefit of million result of remeasurement of october the special termination benefit related to early retirement incentive offered part of voluntary early retirement program for the plan in the fourth quarter of this program allowed certain employee the opportunity to voluntarily leave the company we expect the following component of aocl to be recognized component of net

following represents our weighted average assumption of december defined benefitpension plan retiree healthbenefit plan percent rate for benefit discount rate for net benefit of compensation increase for benefit rate of compensation increase for net benefit expected return on plan asset for net benefit annually evaluate the expected return on plan asset in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan in evaluating the expected rate of return we consider many factor with primary analysis of current and projected market condition asset return and asset allocation and the view of leading financial adviser and economist we may also review our historical assumption compared with actual result well the assumption and trend rate utilized by similar plan where applicable given the design of our retiree health benefit plan healthcare cost trend rate do not have material impact on our financial condition or result of operation the following benefit payment which reflect expected future service appropriate are expected to be paid follows benefit pension plan health benefit relating to defined benefit pension plan with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan asset were

at december defined benefitpension plan retiree health benefit plan benefit obligation value of plan the total accumulated benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plan wa billion and billion at december and respectively pension and retiree health benefit expense included the following component defined benefitpension plan retiree healthbenefit plan of net periodic benefit cost service cost return on plan asset amortization of prior service benefit recognized actuarial special termination net periodic benefit cost of january we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost component of the net periodic pension and retiree health benefit plan cost this new method us the spot yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve to the projected cash outflow of our obligation previously those cost were determined using single weighted average discount rate the new method provides more precise measure of interest and service cost by improving the correlation between the projected benefit cash flow and the specific spot yield curve rate the change did not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation the change in service and interest cost is recorded in the actuarial gain and loss recorded in aocl we have accounted for this change change in estimate prospectively the following represents the amount recognized in other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december and defined benefitpension plan retiree healthbenefit plan gain loss arising during period amendment during period amortization of prior service benefit cost included in net amortization of net actuarial loss included in net currency exchange rate change and other other comprehensive income

by providing employee with an incentive to save our contribution to the plan are based on employee contribution and the level of our match expense under the plan totaled million million and million for the year ended december and respectively we provide certain other postemployment benefit primarily related to disability benefit and accrue for the related cost over the service life of employee expense associated with these benefit plan for the year ended december and were not material plan investmentsour benefit plan investment policy are set with specific consideration of return and risk requirement in relationship to the respective liability and puerto rico plan represent approximately percent of our global investment given the long term nature of our liability these plan have the flexibility to manage an above average degree of risk in the asset portfolio at the investment policy level there are no specifically prohibited investment however within individual investment manager mandate restriction and limitation are contractually set to align with our investment objective ensure risk control and limit concentration we manage our portfolio to minimize concentration of risk by allocating fund within asset category in addition within category we use different manager with various management objective to eliminate any significant concentration of risk our global benefit plan may enter into contractual arrangement derivative to implement the local investment policy or manage particular portfolio risk derivative are principally used to increase or decrease exposure to particular public equity fixed income commodity or currency market more rapidly or le expensively than could be accomplished through the use of the cash market the plan utilize both exchange traded and over the counter instrument the maximum exposure to either market or counterparty credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable and is managed within contractual limit we expect all of our counterparties to meet their obligation the gross value of these derivative receivables and payable are not material to the global asset portfolio and their value are reflected within the table below the defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plan allocation for the and puerto rico currently comprises approximately percent growth investment and percent fixed income investment the growth investment allocation encompasses and international public equity security hedge fund private equity like investment and real estate these portfolio allocation are intended to reduce overall risk by providing diversification while seeking moderate to high return over the long term public equity security are well diversified and invested in and international small to large company across various asset manager and style the remaining portion of the growth portfolio is invested in private alternative investment fixed income investment primarily consist of fixed income security in treasury and agency emerging market debt obligation corporate bond mortgage backed security commercial mortgage backed obligation and any related repurchase agreement hedge fund are privately owned institutional investment fund that generally have moderate liquidity hedge fund seek specified level of absolute return regardless of overall market condition and generally have low correlation to public equity and debt market hedge fund often invest substantially in financial market instrument stock bond commodity currency derivative etc using very broad range of trading activity to manage portfolio risk hedge fund strategy focus primarily on security selection and seek to be neutral with respect to market move common grouping of hedge fund strategy include relative value tactical and event driven relative value strategy include arbitrage when the same asset can simultaneously be bought and sold at different price achieving an immediate profit tactical strategy often take long and short position to reduce or eliminate overall market risk while seeking particular investment opportunity event strategy opportunity can evolve from specific company announcement such merger and acquisition and typically have little correlation to overall market directional movement our hedge fund investment are made through limited partnership interest primarily in fund of fund structure to ensure diversification across many strategy and many individual manager plan holding in hedge fund are valued based on net asset value navs calculated by each fund or general partner applicable and we have the ability to redeem these investment at nav private equity like investment fund typically have low liquidity and are made through long term partnership or joint venture that invest in pool of capital invested in primarily non publicly traded entity underlying investment include venture capital early stage investing buyout and special situation investing private equity management firm typically acquire and then reorganize private company to create increased long term value private equity like fund usually have limited life of approximately year and require minimum investment commitment from their limited partner our private investment are made both directly into fund and through fund of fund structure to ensure broad diversification of management style and across the portfolio plan holding in private equity like investment are valued using the value reported by the partnership adjusted for known cash flow and significant event through our reporting date value provided by the partnership are primarily based on analysis of and judgment about the underlying investment input to these valuation include underlying navs discounted cash flow valuation comparable market valuation and may also include adjustment for currency credit liquidity and other risk applicable the vast majority of these private partnership provide with annual audited financial statement including their compliance with fair valuation procedure consistent with applicable accounting standard real estate is composed of both public and private holding real estate investment in registered investment company that trade on an exchange are classified level on the fair value hierarchy real estate investment in fund measured at fair value on the basis of nav provided by the fund

mark to market value of derivative the cash value of the trust owned insurance contract is invested in investment grade publicly traded equity and fixed income security other than hedge fund private equity like investment and real estate which are discussed above we determine fair value based on market approach using quoted market value significant other observable input for identical or

approximately million to our defined benefit pension plan to satisfy minimum funding requirement for the year additional discretionary contribution are not expected to be significant note contingencieswe are party to various legal action and government investigation the most significant of these are described below it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matter and we can not reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss in excess of amount accrued for any of these matter however we believe that except noted below with respect to the alimta patent litigation and administrative proceeding the resolution of all such matter will not have material adverse effect on consolidated financial position or liquidity but could possibly be material to our consolidated result of operation in any one accounting period litigation accrual environmental liability and the related estimated insurance recoverables are reflected on gross basis liability and asset respectively on our consolidated balance sheet with respect to the product liability claim currently asserted against we have accrued for our estimated exposure to the extent they are both probable and reasonably estimable based on the information available to we accrue for certain product liability claim incurred but not filed to the extent we can formulate reasonable estimate of their cost we estimate these expense based primarily on historical claim experience and data regarding product usage legal defense cost expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability loss contingency are accrued when both probable and reasonably estimable alimta patent litigation and administrative proceedingsa number of generic manufacturer are seeking approval in the japan and number of country in europe to market generic form of alimta prior to the expiration of our vitamin regimen patent alleging that those patent are invalid not infringed or both we believe our alimta vitamin regimen patent are valid and enforceable against these generic manufacturer however it is not possible to determine the ultimate outcome of the proceeding and accordingly we can provide no assurance that we will prevail an unfavorable outcome could have material adverse impact on our future consolidated result of operation liquidity and financial position we expect that
