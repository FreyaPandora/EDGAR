that we face for the convenience of the reader the risk are listed in the category those risk primarily apply but may also apply to other category competitive and reputational risksour continued success is substantially dependent on positive perception of target which if eroded could adversely affect our business and our relationship with our guest and team member we believe that one of the reason our guest prefer to shop at target our team member choose target place of employment and our vendor choose to do business with is the reputation we have built many year for serving our four primary constituency guest team member shareholder and the community in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve grow and leverage the value of target reputation reputational value is based in large part on perception while reputation may take decade to build any negative incident quickly erode trust and confidence particularly if they result in adverse mainstream and social medium publicity governmental investigation or litigation those type of incident could have an adverse impact on perception and lead to tangible adverse effect on our business including consumer boycott lost sale loss of new store and technology development opportunity or team member retention and recruiting difficulty for example we experienced weaker expected sale immediately following the announcement of the data breach that occurred in the fourth quarter of and while we now believe the incident will not have long term impact to our relationship with our guest it is an example of an incident that affected our reputation and negatively impacted our sale for period of time in addition the long term reputational impact of discontinuing our canadian operation on our guest team member vendor and other constituency is unknown and we may need to take action that could increase our expense and adversely affect the result of our operation if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailer our result of operation could be adversely affected the retail business is highly competitive in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guest shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through careful combination of price merchandise assortment convenience guest service loyalty program and marketing effort our ability to create personalized guest experience through the collection and use of guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailer guest perception regarding the cleanliness and safety of our store the functionality and reliability of our digital channel our in stock level and other factor also affect our ability to compete no single competitive factor is dominant and action by our competitor on any of these factor could have an adverse effect on our sale gross margin and expense we sell many product under our owned and exclusive brand these brand are an important part of our business because they differentiate from other retailer generally carry higher margin than equivalent national brand product and represent significant portion of our overall sale if one or more of these brand experience loss of consumer acceptance or confidence our sale and gross margin could be adversely affected the continuing migration and evolution of retailing to online and mobile channel ha increased our challenge in differentiating ourselves from other retailer in particular consumer are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real time product availability using digital tool which can lead to decision based solely on price the functionality of the digital tool or combination of those and other factor we must compete by offering consistent and convenient shopping experience for our guest regardless of the ultimate sale channel providing and maintaining digital tool for our guest and team member that have the right feature and are reliable and easy to use working with our vendor to offer unique and distinctive merchandise and encouraging our guest to shop with confidence with our price match policy failure to effectively execute in these effort action by our competitor in response to these effort or failure of our vendor to manage their channel content and technology system could hurt our ability to differentiate ourselves from other retailer and result have an adverse effect on sale gross margin and expense we are unable to successfully develop and maintain relevant and reliable omnichannel experience for our guest our sale result of operation and reputation could be adversely affected our business ha evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guest across multiple channel in store online mobile and social medium among others our guest are using computer tablet mobile phone and other device to shop in our store and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspect of our business we currently provide full and mobile version of our website target com offer application for mobile phone and tablet and interact with our guest through social medium omnichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectation and counteract new development and technology investment by our competitor our omnichannel retailing effort include implementing new technology software and process to be able to fulfill guest order from any point within our system of store and distribution center which is extremely complex and may not meet guest expectation for timely and accurate delivery if we are unable to attract and retain team member or contract with third party the specialized skill needed to support our omnichannel effort implement improvement to our guest facing technology in timely manner allow real time and accurate visibility to product availability guest are ready to purchase quickly and efficiently fulfill our guest order using the fulfillment and payment method they demand or provide convenient and consistent experience for our guest regardless of the ultimate sale channel our ability to compete and our result of operation could be adversely affected in addition if target com and our other guest facing technology system do not appeal to our guest reliably function designed or maintain the privacy of guest data or if we are unable consistently meet our brand promise to our guest we may experience loss of guest confidence lost sale or be exposed to fraudulent purchase which could adversely affect our reputation and result of operation if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preference our sale gross margin and profitability could suffer substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decision and effectively manage our inventory in broad range of merchandise category including apparel home décor seasonal offering food and other merchandise for example we are investing more of our overall resource including capital marketing and product development to focus on signature category including baby kid wellness and style and tailor our food assortment to support guest wellness goal and become more specialized with unique and differentiated item failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer taste preference spending pattern and other lifestyle decision emphasize the correct category and personalize our offering to our guest may result in lost sale spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which would lead to deterioration in our result of operation by hurting our sale gross margin and profitability technology investment and infrastructure risksif our capital investment in technology new store and remodeling existing store do not achieve appropriate return our competitive position financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected our business is becoming increasingly reliant on technology investment and the return on these investment are le predictable than building new store and remodeling existing store we are currently making and will continue to make significant technology investment to support our omnichannel effort implement improvement to our guest facing technology and evolve our inventory management system information process and computer system to more efficiently run our business and remain competitive and relevant to our guest these technology initiative might not provide the anticipated benefit or may provide on delayed schedule or at higher cost we must monitor and choose the right investment and implement them at the right pace in addition our growth also depends in part on our ability to build new store and remodel existing store in manner that achieves appropriate return on our capital investment we compete with other retailer and business for suitable location for our store many of our expected new store site are smaller and non standard footprint located in fully developed market which are generally more time consuming and expensive undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban market targeting the wrong opportunity failing to make the best investment or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our need could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or result of operation significant disruption in our computer system and our inability to adequately maintain and update those system could adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain guest confidence we rely extensively on our computer system to manage inventory process guest transaction manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendor and other third party service redcard account and summarize and analyze result and on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer system our system are subject to damage or interruption from power outage telecommunication failure computer virus and malicious attack security breach and catastrophic event if our system are damaged or fail to function properly we may incur substantial repair or replacement cost experience data loss or theft and impediment to our ability to manage inventory or process guest transaction and encounter lost guest confidence which could adversely affect our result of operation the data breach we experienced in the fourth quarter of negatively impacted our ability to handle customer inquiry and we experienced weaker than expected sale immediately following the announcement of the data breach similarly we experienced temporary network disruption not involving data breach in june that prevented many of our point of sale register from working in limited geographic region this disruption caused checkout delay and generated negative publicity and we engaged in promotional activity to retain our customer during the delay we continually make significant technology investment that will help maintain and update our existing computer system implementing significant system change increase the risk of computer system disruption the potential problem and interruption associated with implementing technology initiative could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could impact the guest experience and guest confidence data security and privacy risksif our effort to protect the security of information about our guest team member and vendor are unsuccessful we may face additional costly government enforcement action and private litigation and our sale and reputation could suffer an important component of our business involves the receipt and storage of information about our guest team member and vendor we have program in place to detect and respond to data security incident however because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long period of time we may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure in addition hardware software or application we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized party may also attempt to gain access to our system or facility or those of third party with we do business through fraud trickery or other form of deceiving our team member contractor and temporary staff the data breach in the fourth quarter of all incident we experienced were insignificant the data breach we experienced wa significant and went undetected for several week we and our vendor have experienced data security incident other than the data breach however to date these other incident have not been material to our consolidated financial statement if we or our vendor experience additional significant data security breach or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant data security breach we could be exposed to additional government enforcement action and private litigation in addition our guest could further lose confidence in our ability to protect their information which could cause them to discontinue using our redcards or pharmacy service or stop shopping with altogether we have recorded significant expense related to the data breach our loss could exceed the amount we have recorded by material amount and these matter could have material adverse impact on our result of operation the data breach we experienced wa significant went undetected for several week and involved the theft of certain payment card and guest information through unauthorized access to our network we experienced weaker than expected sale immediately following the announcement of the data breach and we are currently facing litigation seeking damage or other related relief allegedly arising of the data breach in addition state and federal agency including state attorney general the federal trade commission and the sec are investigating event related to the data breach including it occurred it consequence and our response the governmental agency investigating the data breach may seek to impose on fine and or other monetary relief and or injunctive relief that could materially increase our data security cost adversely impact how we operate our network and collect and use guest information and put at competitive disadvantage with other retailer furthermore three of the four major card network which them represent substantial majority of the payment card potentially impacted by the data breach have made written claim either directly or through our acquiring bank and we believe that it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make claim against collectively the claim investigation and other possible consequence of the data breach may have an adverse effect on how we operate our business and our result of operation in the future we may be subject to additional investigation and claim of this sort we have recorded data breach related expense that include our estimated probable loss for these matter and it is reasonably possible that we may incur material loss in excess of the amount accrued supply chain and third party risksinterruptions in our supply chain or fulfillment network increased commodity supply chain and fulfillment cost or change in our relationship with our vendor could adversely affect our gross margin expense and result of operation we are dependent on our vendor to supply merchandise to our distribution center store and our guest in timely and efficient manner we continue to add fulfillment capability or pursue strategy with different fulfillment requirement our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging if our fulfillment network not operate properly or if vendor fails to deliver on it commitment whether due to financial difficulty or other reason we could experience merchandise out of stock delivery delay or increased delivery cost that could lead to lost sale and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our result of operation in addition large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the united state with china our single largest source political or financial instability trade restriction the outbreak of pandemic labor unrest transport capacity and cost port security weather condition natural disaster or other event that could slow or disrupt port activity and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and or adversely affect our result of operation for example the labor dispute impacting the port on the west coast of the that began in have caused to make alternative arrangement to continue the flow of inventory and if these dispute recur or worsen it may have material impact on our cost or inventory supply change in the cost of procuring commodity used in our merchandise or the cost related to our supply chain including vendor cost labor fuel tariff currency exchange rate and supply chain transparency initiative could have an adverse effect on gross margin expense and result of operation change in our relationship with our vendor also have the potential to increase our expense and adversely affect result of operation we are unable to determine whether our decision to discontinue our canadian operation will negatively impact our relationship with vendor that also supply our operation in way that might cause le favorable term increased cost result in le timely and efficient delivery or impact their ability to sell to target disruption in relationship with third party provide service in connection with certain aspect of our business could adversely affect our operation we rely on third party to support variety of business function including portion of our technology development and system our digital platform and distribution network operation credit and debit card transaction processing extension of credit for our redcard reward loyalty program and aspect of our clinic and pharmacy operation if we are unable to contract with third party having the specialized skill needed to support those strategy or integrate their product and service with our business or if we fail to properly manage those third party or if they fail to meet our performance standard and expectation including with respect to data security our reputation sale and result of operation could be adversely affected in addition we could face increased cost associated with finding replacement provider or hiring new team member to provide these service in house legal regulatory global and other external risksour earnings are highly susceptible to the state of macroeconomic condition and consumer confidence in the united state virtually all of our sale are in the united state making our result highly dependent on consumer confidence and the health of the economy in addition significant portion of our total sale is derived from store located in five state california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic condition in these state deterioration in macroeconomic condition or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many way including slowing sale growth or reduction in overall sale and reducing gross margin consideration impact the success of our credit card program even though we no longer own consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the economic performance of the credit card program with td deterioration in macroeconomic condition could adversely affect the volume of new credit account the amount of credit card program balance and the ability of credit card holder to pay their balance these condition could result in receiving lower profit sharing payment weather condition where our store are located may impact consumer shopping pattern which alone or together with natural disaster particularly in area where our sale are concentrated could adversely affect our result of operation uncharacteristic or significant weather condition can affect consumer shopping pattern particularly in apparel and seasonal item which could lead to lost sale or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term result of operation in addition our three largest state by total sale are california texas and florida area where natural disaster are more prevalent natural disaster in those state or in other area where our sale are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our store distribution center or key vendor and cause delay in the distribution of merchandise from our vendor to our distribution center store and directly to guest which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost and lowering our sale we rely on large global and changing workforce of target team member contractor and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global location our labor cost and result of operation could be adversely affected with approximately team member our workforce cost represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resource our business change many team member are in entry level or part time position with historically high turnover rate our ability to meet our changing labor need while controlling our cost is subject to external factor such unemployment level prevailing wage rate collective bargaining effort health care and other benefit cost changing demographic and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain adequate number and an appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing our operation guest service level and support function could suffer those factor together with increasing wage and benefit cost could adversely affect our result of operation of march none of our team member were working under collective bargaining agreement we are periodically subject to labor organizing effort if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreement in the future it could adversely affect our labor cost and how we operate our business we maintain headquarters location in india where ha been greater political financial environmental and health instability than the united state an extended disruption of our operation in india could adversely affect certain operation supporting stability and maintenance of our digital channel and information technology development failure to address product safety concern could adversely affect our sale and result of operation if our merchandise offering including food drug and child product do not meet applicable safety standard or our guest expectation regarding safety we could experience lost sale and increased cost and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendor must comply with applicable product safety law and we are dependent on them to ensure that the product we buy comply with all safety standard event that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concern including food or drug contamination could expose to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recall and other liability in addition negative guest perception regarding the safety of the product we sell could cause our guest to seek alternative source for their need resulting in lost sale in those circumstance it may be difficult and costly for to regain the confidence of our guest our failure to comply with federal state local and international law or change in these law could increase our cost reduce our margin and lower our sale our business is subject to wide array of law and regulation in the united state and other country in which we operate significant workforce related legislative change could increase our expense and adversely affect our operation example of possible workforce related legislative change include change to an employer obligation to recognize collective bargaining unit the process by which collective bargaining agreement are negotiated or imposed minimum wage requirement and health care mandate in addition change in the regulatory environment medicare reimbursement privacy and information security product safety payment method and related fee responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expense to increase without an ability to pas through any increased expense through higher price for example we are currently facing government inquiry related to the data breach that may result in the imposition of fine or other penalty in addition any legislative or regulatory change adopted in reaction to the recent retail industry data breach could increase or accelerate our compliance cost also our pharmacy and clinic operation are governed by various regulation and significant change in or our noncompliance with these regulation could have material adverse effect on our compliance cost and result of operation in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable law and regulation including wage and hour law the foreign corrupt practice act and local anti bribery law we could be subject to legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost reducing our margin and lowering our sale financial riskschanges in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our net income number of factor influence our effective income tax rate including change in tax law tax treaty interpretation of existing law and our ability to sustain our reporting position on examination change in any of those factor could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operation outside of the united state may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate if we are unable to access the capital market or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and result of operation could suffer we are dependent on stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operation and capital investment in particular we have historically relied on the public debt market to fund portion of our capital investment and the commercial paper market and bank credit facility to fund seasonal need for working capital our continued access to these market depends on multiple factor including the condition of debt capital market our operating performance and maintaining strong debt rating if rating agency lower our credit rating it could adversely impact our ability to access the debt market our cost of fund and other term for new debt issuance each of the credit rating agency review it rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use variety of derivative product to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price fluctuation disruption or turmoil in the financial market could reduce our ability to meet our capital requirement or fund our working capital need and lead to loss on derivative position resulting from counterparty failure which could adversely affect our financial position and result of operation if we are unable to make fair and orderly exit of our canadian operation or if our existing reserve are not adequate to cover our ultimate liability our financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected on january we announced our decision to discontinue our canadian operation and authorized filing by our direct wholly owned subsidiary target canada co and certain other subsidiary under the company creditor arrangement act canada during the fourth quarter ended january we reported pretax loss from our discontinued canadian operation including pretax exit loss non cash pretax impairment charge and other operating loss the loss from discontinued operation include probable loss relating to certain claim that may be asserted against result of our guaranty of certain obligation of target canada co or other claim that may be made against our reserve relating to these matter may not be adequate to cover our ultimate liability and amount beyond our reserve could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation in addition we may suffer other loss for which we have

measure is provided on page consisted of week canada exiton january following comprehensive assessment of canadian operation our board of director approved plan to discontinue operating store in canada result of this decision on january target canada co and certain other wholly owned subsidiary of target collectively canada subsidiary filed for protection the filing under the company creditor arrangement act ccaa with the ontario superior court of justice in toronto the court the canada subsidiary comprise substantially all of our canadian operation and our canadian segment the canada subsidiary have commenced an orderly liquidation process and store in canada will remain open during the liquidation to assist with the exit plan the court approved the appointment of monitor and certain other financial advisor result of the filing we no longer have controlling interest in the canada subsidiary for this reason we deconsolidated the canada subsidiary effective january resulting in pretax impairment loss on deconsolidation and other charge collectively totaling billion the pretax loss on deconsolidation includes the derecognition of the carrying amount of the canada subsidiary asset liability and accumulated other comprehensive loss and the recording of our remaining interest at fair value subsequent to deconsolidation we will use the cost method to account for our equity investment in the canada subsidiary which ha been reflected zero in our consolidated statement of financial position at january based on the estimated fair value of the canada subsidiary net asset loan to and account receivable from the canada subsidiary are recorded at an estimated fair value of million our ultimate cash recovery on these claim is subject to the final liquidation value of the canada subsidiary and could vary materially from our estimate our canada exit represents strategic shift in our business for this reason our canadian segment result for all period prior to the january deconsolidation and cost to exit are classified discontinued operation we have recognized tax benefit of billion in discontinued operation which primarily relates to the loss on our investment in canada and includes other tax benefit resulting from certain asset write offs and liability paid or accrued to facilitate the liquidation we have realized the majority of these tax benefit in the first quarter of and expect to realize substantially all of the remainder in the recorded expense include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claim that may be asserted against primarily under guarantee in certain lease our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation that claim will be asserted against and negotiated settlement will be reached and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable were these claim to be litigated given the early stage of our exit and the filing our estimate involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claim and estimated payment by the canada subsidiary we are not able to reasonably estimate range of possible loss in excess of the year end accrual because there are significant factual and legal issue to be resolved we believe that it is reasonably possible that future change to our estimate of loss and the ultimate amount paid on these claim could be material to our result of operation in future period any such loss would be recorded in discontinued operation we expect to incur severance legal and professional service expense associated with our canadian exit we will recognize these expense within discontinued operation service are received and liability are incurred we currently can not predict the timing of such expense and associated cash disbursement however we do not expect these amount to be material to our result in future period note of the financial statement for further

data breach in we recorded million of pretax data breach related expense and million of expected insurance proceeds for net expense of million these expense were included in our consolidated statement of operation selling general and administrative expense sg but were not part of segment sg along with legal and other professional service these expense include an accrual for estimated probable loss for we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach related claim including claim by the payment card network our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlement and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the loss we have accrued were these claim to be litigated of january we have incurred million of

conditioned on term of the letter of credit being met real estate obligation include commitment for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facility we have not included obligation under our pension and postretirement health care benefit plan in the contractual obligation table above because no additional amount are required to be funded of january our historical practice regarding these plan ha been to contribute amount necessary to satisfy minimum pension funding requirement plus periodic discretionary amount determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangement other than the unrecorded contractual obligation noted above we do not have any arrangement or relationship with entity that are not consolidated into the financial statement critical accounting estimatesour analysis of operation and financial condition is based on our consolidated financial statement prepared in accordance with gaap preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption affecting the reported amount of asset and liability at the date of the consolidated financial statement reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability in the note to consolidated financial statement we describe the significant accounting policy used in preparing the consolidated financial statement our estimate are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual could differ under other assumption or condition however except discussed below regarding canada exit and data breach related cost we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that there will be material change in future estimate or assumption our senior management ha discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director the following item in our consolidated financial statement require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sale we use the retail inventory method to account for the majority of our inventory and the related cost of sale under this method inventory is stated at cost using the last in first out lifo method determined by applying cost to retail ratio to each merchandise grouping ending retail value the cost of our inventory includes the amount we pay to our supplier to acquire inventory freight cost incurred in connection with the delivery of product to our distribution center and store and import cost reduced by vendor income and cash discount the majority of our distribution center operating cost including compensation and benefit are expensed to cost of sale in the period incurred since inventory value is adjusted regularly to reflect market condition our inventory methodology reflects the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated loss related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical loss verified by physical inventory count historically our actual physical inventory count result have shown our estimate to be reliable markdowns designated for clearance activity are recorded when the salability of the merchandise ha diminished inventory is at risk of obsolescence if economic condition change including changing consumer demand guest preference changing consumer credit market or increasing competition we believe these risk are largely mitigated because our inventory typically turn in le than three month inventory wa million and million at january and february respectively and is further described in note of the financial statement vendor income receivable cost of sale and sg expense are partially offset by various form of consideration received from our vendor vendor income vendor income is earned for variety of program such volume rebate markdown allowance promotion advertising allowance and compliance program we establish receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreement in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the assumption used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustment to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable wa million and million at january and february respectively and is described further in note of the financial statement long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow independent of other asset an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flow from the operation and or disposition of the asset are le than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over it fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flow or independent opinion of value appropriate we recorded impairment of million million and million in and respectively which are described further in note of january percent decrease in the fair value of asset we intend to sell or close would result in additional impairment of million in historically we have not realized material loss upon sale of long lived asset investment in and receivables from canada subsidiary we determined the fair value and recoverability of our canadian investment by comparing the estimated fair value of the underlying asset of the canada subsidiary to estimated liability at the time of the filing we estimated the fair value of the major asset class using estimated selling price le cost to sell the income approach based on estimated market rent and capitalization rate and discounted cash flow analysis of the differential between estimated market rent and contractual rent payment appropriate we also applied an estimated liquidation discount to reflect the ccaa filing outstanding liability include account payable and other liability forward commitment unsubordinated related party payable lease liability and other potential claim potential claim include an accrual for the estimated probable loss related to claim that may be asserted against the canada subsidiary under certain contract based on our estimate the fair value of liability exceeds the fair value of asset to ass the fair value and recoverability of amount receivable from the canada subsidiary we estimated the fair value of the underlying net asset of the canada subsidiary available for distribution to their creditor in relation to the estimated creditor claim and the priority of those claim our estimate involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information an assessment of the validity of certain claim and estimated payment by the canada subsidiary our ultimate recovery is subject to the liquidation value of the canada subsidiary and may vary significantly from our current estimate see note of the financial statement for further information insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability worker compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claim however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risk liability associated with these loss include estimate of both claim filed and loss incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial method which consider number of factor to estimate our ultimate cost of loss general liability and worker compensation liability are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liability referred to above are not discounted our worker compensation and general liability accrual wa million and million at january and february respectively we believe that the amount accrued are appropriate however our liability could be significantly affected if future occurrence or loss development differ from our assumption for example percent increase or decrease in average claim cost would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material refer to item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further disclosure of the market risk associated with these exposure we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain event including network security matter since the data breach we have recognized million of expected insurance recovery related to the data breach of january we have million insurance recovery receivable relating to the data breach because we believe recovery is probable however it is possible that the insurance carrier could dispute our claim and that we may be unable to collect the recorded receivable income tax we pay income tax based on the tax statute regulation and case law of the various jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matter in dispute with tax authority the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax position would withstand challenge by taxing authority we periodically reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate liability for uncertain tax position including interest and penalty were million and million at january and february respectively we believe the resolution of these matter will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement income tax are described further in note of the financial statement pension and postretirement health care accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan well several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plan and postretirement health care plan for certain current and retired team member the cost for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using the assumption described in the following paragraph eligibility and the level of benefit varies depending on team member full time or part time status date of hire and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using assumption about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rate the assumption used to determine the period end benefit obligation also establish the expense for the next year with adjustment made for any significant plan or participant change our expected long term rate of return on plan asset of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market condition our compound annual rate of return on qualified plan asset wa percent percent percent and percent for the year year year and year period respectively one percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligation is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bond using yield for maturity that are in line with the duration of our pension liability our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team member than it doe for older longer service pension eligible team member pension and postretirement health care benefit are further described in note of the financial statement legal and other contingency we are exposed to other claim and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various method to resolve these matter in manner that we believe serf the best interest of our shareholder and other constituent when loss is probable we record an accrual based on the reasonably estimable loss or range of loss when no point of loss is more likely than another we record the lowest amount in the estimated range of loss and disclose the estimated range we do not record liability for reasonably possible loss contingency but do disclose range of reasonably possible loss if they are material and we are able to estimate such range we can not provide range of reasonably possible loss we explain the factor that prevent from determining such range historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material we believe the accrual recorded in our consolidated financial statement properly reflect loss exposure that are both probable and reasonably estimable with the exception of canada exit and data breach related loss exposure we do not believe any of the currently identified claim or litigation may materially affect our result of operation cash flow or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause material adverse impact on the result of operation cash flow or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future period refer to note and of the financial statement for further information on the canada exit and data breach related contingency respectively new accounting pronouncementswe do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncement will have material effect on our financial statement forward looking statementsthis report contains forward looking statement which are based on our current assumption and expectation these statement are typically accompanied by the word expect may could believe would might anticipates or word of similar import the principal forward looking statement in this report include our financial performance statement regarding the adequacy of and cost associated with our source of liquidity the fair value and amount of the beneficial interest asset the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditure the impact of change in the expected effective income tax rate on net income the expected compliance with debt covenant the expected impact of new accounting pronouncement our intention regarding future dividend contribution and payment related to our pension and postretirement health care plan the expected return on pension plan asset the expected timing and recognition of compensation expense the effect of macroeconomic condition the adequacy of our reserve for general liability worker compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserve for investigation inquiry claim and litigation including those related to the data breach and discontinuing our canadian operation expected insurance recovery expected change to our contractual obligation and liability the expected ability to recognize deferred tax asset and liability and the timing of such recognition including net operating loss carryforwards and tax benefit related to discontinuing our canadian operation the process timing and effect of discontinuing our canadian operation the resolution of tax matter and change in our assumption and expectation all such forward looking statement are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statement contained in the private security litigation reform act of amended although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking statement our actual result could be materially different the most important factor which could cause our actual result to differ from our forward looking statement are set forth on our description of risk factor in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement in this report forward looking statement speak only of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskat january our exposure to market risk wa primarily from interest rate change on our debt obligation of which are at libor plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to difference between our floating rate debt obligation compared to our floating rate short term investment at january our floating rate short term investment exceeded our floating rate debt by approximately million based on our balance sheet position at january the annualized effect of percentage point decrease in floating interest rate on our floating rate short term investment net of our debt obligation would decrease earnings before income tax by approximately million in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investment over time but that may vary in different interest rate environment see further description of our debt and derivative instrument in note and of the note to financial statement we record our general liability and worker compensation liability at net present value therefore these liability fluctuate with change in interest rate periodically in certain interest rate environment we economically hedge portion of our exposure to these interest rate change by entering into interest rate forward contract that partially mitigate the effect of interest rate change based on our balance sheet position at january the annualized of percentage point decrease in interest rate would be to decrease earnings before income tax by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuation on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liability is inversely related to change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect against decline in interest rate we hold high quality long duration bond and interest rate swap in our pension plan trust at year end we hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status more fully described in note and note of the financial statement we are exposed to market return on accumulated team member balance in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plan by making investment in life insurance contract and prepaid forward contract on our own common stock that offset substantial portion of our economic exposure to the return on these plan the annualized effect of one percentage point change in market return on our nonqualified defined contribution plan inclusive of the effect of the investment vehicle used to manage our economic exposure would not be significant there have been no other material change in our primary risk exposure or management of market risk since the prior year financial statement and

of guest who shopped at our store between november and december in addition the intruder stole certain guest information including name mailing address phone number or email address for up to million individual payment card network loss contingenciesin the event of data breach where payment card data is or may have been stolen the payment card network contract purport to give them the ability to make claim for reimbursement of incremental counterfeit fraud loss and non ordinary course operating expense such card reissuance cost that the payment card network believe they or their issuing bank have incurred result of the event for to have liability for such claim we believe that court would have to find that among other thing at the time of the data breach the portion of our network that handle payment card data wa noncompliant with applicable data security standard in manner that contributed to the data breach and the network operating rule around reimbursement of operating cost and counterfeit fraud loss are enforceable while an independent third party assessor found the portion of our network that handle payment card data to be compliant with applicable data security standard in the fall of and late the forensic investigator working on behalf of the payment card network claimed in first quarter that we were not in compliance with those standard at the time of the data breach during three of the four major payment card network which between them represent substantial majority of the payment card potentially impacted by the data breach made written claim against either directly or through our acquiring bank we believe it is probable that the fourth major payment card network will also make claim against we expect to dispute the claim that have been or may be made against by the payment card network and we think it is probable that our dispute would lead to settlement negotiation consistent with the experience of other entity that suffered similar payment card breach we believe such negotiation would effect combined settlement of the payment card network counterfeit fraud loss allegation and their non ordinary course operating expense allegation our accrual for estimated probable loss discussed below include accrual for what we believe to be the vast majority of both actual and potential claim from the payment card network and governmental investigationsin addition more than action have been filed in court in many state along with one action in canada and other claim have been or may be asserted against on behalf of guest payment card issuing bank shareholder or others seeking damage or other related relief allegedly arising out of the data breach state and federal agency including state attorney general the federal trade

incurred million of cumulative expense partially offset by expected insurance recovery of million for net cumulative expense of million these expense were included in our consolidated statement of operation selling general and administrative expense sg but were not part of segment result along with legal and other professional service these expense include an accrual for estimated probable loss for what we believe to be the vast majority of actual and potential breach related claim including claim by the payment card network our probable loss estimate is based on the expectation of reaching negotiated settlement and not on any determination that it is probable we would be found liable for the loss we have accrued were these claim to be litigated given the varying stage of claim and related proceeding and the inherent uncertainty surrounding them our estimate involve significant judgment and are based on currently available information historical precedent and an assessment of the validity of certain claim our estimate may change new information becomes available and although we do not believe it is probable it is reasonably possible that we may incur material loss in excess of the amount accrued we are not able to estimate the amount of such reasonably possible excess loss exposure at this time because many of the matter are in the early stage alleged damage have not been specified and there are significant factual and legal issue to be resolved the accrual doe not reflect future breach related legal consulting or administrative fee which are expensed incurred
