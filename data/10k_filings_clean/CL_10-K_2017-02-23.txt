statement dollar in million except per share amount critical accounting policy and use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america requires management to use judgment and make estimate the level of uncertainty in estimate and assumption increase with the length of time until the underlying transaction are completed actual result could ultimately differ from those estimate the accounting policy that are most critical in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statement are those that are both important to the presentation of the consolidated financial statement and require significant or complex judgment and estimate on the part of management the company critical accounting policy are reviewed periodically with the audit committee of the board of director in certain instance accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america allow for the selection of alternative accounting method the company significant policy that involve the selection of alternative method are accounting for shipping and handling cost and inventory shipping and handling cost may be reported either component of cost of sale or selling general and administrative expense the company report such cost primarily related to warehousing and outbound freight in the consolidated statement of income component of selling general and administrative expense accordingly the company gross profit margin is not comparable with the gross profit margin of those company that include shipping and handling charge in cost of sale if such cost had been included in cost of sale gross profit margin would have decreased by bps from to in and decreased by bps in and respectively with no impact on reported earnings the company account for inventory using both the first in first out fifo method of inventory and the lifo method of inventory there would have been no material impact on reported earnings for or had all inventory been accounted for under the fifo method the area of accounting that involve significant or complex judgment and estimate are pension and other retiree benefit cost assumption stock based compensation asset impairment uncertain tax position tax valuation allowance legal and other contingency reserve and prior to the deconsolidation of the company venezuelan operation the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statement of cp venezuela in pension accounting the most significant actuarial assumption are the discount rate and the long term rate of return on plan asset the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for defined benefit plan wa and of december and respectively the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation for other postretirement plan wa and of december and respectively discount rate used for the and international defined benefit and other postretirement plan are based on yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality bond whose projected cash flow approximate the projected benefit payment of the plan the assumed long term rate of return on plan asset for plan wa of december and in determining the long term rate of return the company considers the nature of the plan investment and the historical rate of return average annual rate of return for the plan for the most recent year year year year and year period were and respectively in addition the current assumed rate of return for the plan is based upon the nature of the plan investment with target asset allocation of approximately in fixed income security in equity security and in real estate and other investment change in the assumed rate of return on plan asset of the pension plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by approximately change in the discount rate for the pension plan would impact future net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by approximately third assumption is the long term rate of compensation increase change in which would partially offset the impact of change in either the discount rate or the long term rate of return this rate wa of december and refer to note retirement plan and other retiree benefit to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the company pension and other postretirement plan dollar in million except per share amount the assumption requiring the most judgment in accounting for other postretirement benefit is the medical cost trend rate the company review external data and it historical trend for health care cost to determine the medical cost trend rate the assumed rate of increase for the postretirement benefit plan is for declining to by and remaining at for the year thereafter the effect on the total of service and interest cost component of increase in the assumed long term medical cost trend rate would decrease net income attributable to colgate palmolive company by the company recognizes the cost of employee service received in exchange for award of equity instrument such stock option and restricted stock unit based on the fair value of those award at the date of grant the company us the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock option award the weighted average estimated fair value of each stock option award granted in the year ended december wa the black scholes model us various assumption to determine the fair value of stock option award these assumption include the expected term of stock option award expected volatility rate risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield while these assumption do not require significant judgment the significant input are determined from historical experience or independent third party source change in these input could result in significant change in the fair value of stock option award one year change in expected term would result in change in fair value of approximately change in volatility would change fair value by approximately goodwill and indefinite life intangible asset such the company global brand are subject to impairment test at least annually the company performs either quantitative or qualitative assessment to determine the fair value of it reporting unit for goodwill and fair value of it indefinite life intangible asset the asset impairment analysis is generally performed using an income method which requires several estimate including future cash flow consistent with management strategic plan sale growth rate foreign exchange rate and the selection of discount rate for the company goodwill impairment analysis fair value is also determined using the market approach which is generally derived from metric of comparable publicly traded company when multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately qualitative factor in addition to those quantitative measure discussed above include assessment of general macroeconomic condition industry specific consideration and historical financial performance the estimated fair value of the company intangible asset substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value except for the intangible asset acquired in the sanex acquisition in which were recorded at fair value the estimated fair value of the company reporting unit also substantially exceeds the recorded carrying value therefore it is not reasonably likely that significant change in these estimate would occur that would result in an impairment charge related to these asset asset impairment analysis related to certain fixed asset in connection with the restructuring program requires management best estimate of net realizable value the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax position involves consideration of the amount and probability of various outcome that could be realized upon ultimate resolution tax valuation allowance are established to reduce deferred tax asset such tax loss carryforwards to net realizable value factor considered in estimating net realizable value include historical result by tax jurisdiction carryforward period income tax strategy and forecasted taxable income legal and other contingency reserve are based on management assessment of the risk of potential loss which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and other advisor such assessment are reviewed each period and revised based on current fact and circumstance if necessary while it is possible that the company cash flow and result of operation in particular quarter or year could be materially affected by the impact of such contingency based on current knowledge it is the opinion of management that these matter will not have material effect on the company financial position or it ongoing result of operation or cash flow refer to note commitment and contingency to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the company contingency dollar in million except per share amount prior to the deconsolidation of the company venezuelan operation the selection of the exchange rate used to remeasure the financial statement of cp venezuela required careful consideration by management given the various currency exchange mechanism that exist in venezuela although access to dollar in venezuela had been challenging because the majority of the product in cp venezuela portfolio were designated essential by the venezuelan government historically cp venezuela access to dollar at the official rate of bolivar per dollar wa generally sufficient to settle most of it dollar obligation for imported material however the company believed this rate wa not applicable to foreign investment and could not be used to pay dividend the company also gave consideration to using the simadi rate to remeasure the financial statement of cp venezuela however cp venezuela did not participate in the simadi market through december and had no intention to do so result the company remeasured the financial statement of cp venezuela at the rate at which it believed wa applicable for the remittance of future dividend which based on the advice of legal counsel wa the sicad rate refer to executive overview and outlook above and to note venezuela to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of the company venezuelan operation the company generates revenue through the sale of well known consumer product to trade customer under established trading term while the recognition of revenue and
