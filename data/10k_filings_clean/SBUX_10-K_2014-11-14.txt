economic condition price is also impacted by trading activity in the arabica coffee future market including hedge fund and commodity index fund in addition green coffee price have been affected in the

including other intangible and goodwill have become impaired in the event we record an impairment charge it could have material impact on our financial result additionally effectively managing growth can be challenging particularly we continue to expand into new channel outside the retail store model increase our focus on our channel development business and expand into new market internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goal philosophy and standard growth can make it increasingly difficult to ensure consistent supply of high quality raw material to locate and hire sufficient number of key employee to maintain an effective system of internal control for globally dispersed enterprise and to train employee worldwide to deliver consistently high quality product and customer experience we face intense competition in each of our channel and market which could lead to reduced profitability the specialty coffee market is intensely competitive including with respect to product quality innovation service convenience and price and we face significant and increasing competition in all these area in each of our channel and market accordingly we do not have leadership position in all channel and market in the the ongoing focus by large competitor in the quick service restaurant sector on selling high quality specialty coffee beverage could lead to decrease in customer traffic to starbucks store and or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sale and result of operation similarly continued competition from well established competitor in our international market could hinder growth and adversely affect our sale and result of operation in those market increased competition in the packaged coffee and tea and single serve and ready to drink coffee beverage market including from new and large entrant to this market could adversely affect

operating segment it comprised approximately of consolidated total net revenue in fiscal if the america operating segment revenue trend slow or decline our other segment may be unable to make any significant shortfall and our business and financial result could be adversely affected and because the america segment is relatively mature and produce the large majority of our operating cash flow

dependent on the success of our cap and emea operating segment in order to achieve our growth target our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of our cap and emea operating segment some or all of our international market business unit mbus which we generally define by the country in which they operate may not be successful in their operation or in

in one or more of the country in which our large mbus operate in particular our china mbu contributes meaningfully to both net revenue and earnings for our cap segment and our japan mbu contributes significantly to earnings in that segment in the emea segment our uk mbu account for significant portion of the net revenue decline in performance of any of these mbus could have material adverse

licensee may face capital constraint or other factor that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in certain market our international operation are also subject to additional inherent risk of conducting business abroad such foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation or requirement to transact in specific currency change or uncertainty in economic legal regulatory social and political condition in our market interpretation and application of law and regulation restrictive action of foreign or governmental authority affecting trade and foreign investment especially during period of heightened tension the and such foreign governmental authority including protective measure such export and custom duty and tariff government intervention favoring local competitor and restriction on the level of foreign ownership import or other business licensing requirement the enforceability of intellectual property and contract right limitation on the repatriation of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction due to current or new and international regulation in developing economy the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient level of disposable income may not be fast we forecast difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation and supply chain logistics including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service due to governmental action affecting supply chain logistics distance language and cultural difference well challenge in recruiting and retaining high quality employee in local market local law that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with retain or terminate employee delay in store opening for reason beyond our control competition with locally relevant competitor or lack of desirable real estate location available for lease at reasonable rate any of which could keep from meeting annual store opening target and in turn negatively impact net revenue operating income and

prospect of content increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity or decrease in the availability of high quality arabica coffee bean or other commodity could have an adverse impact on our business and financial result we purchase roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee bean and related coffee product the price of coffee is subject to significant volatility and ha and may increase significantly due to one or more of the factor described below the high quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on negotiated basis at premium above the price this premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly increase in the coffee commodity price do increase the price of high quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed price purchase commitment we frequently enter into supply contract whereby the quality quantity delivery period and other negotiated term are agreed upon but the date and therefore price at which the base coffee commodity price component will be fixed ha not yet been established these are known price to be fixed contract the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factor in the producing country including weather natural disaster crop disease general increase in farm input and cost of production inventory level and political and economic condition well the action of certain organization and association that have historically attempted to influence price of green coffee through agreement establishing export quota or by restricting coffee supply speculative trading in coffee commodity can also influence coffee price because of the significance of coffee bean to our operation combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practice and hedging activity increase in the cost of high quality arabica coffee bean could have an adverse impact on our profitability in addition if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantity of green coffee due to any of the above factor or to worldwide or regional shortage we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee which could have an adverse impact on our profitability we also purchase significant amount of dairy product particularly fluid milk to support the need of

include increasing our ownership interest in our equity method and cost method investees any decision to increase such ownership interest will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy we believe that future cash flow generated from operation and existing cash and investment both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirement for our core business in those respective market well shareholder distribution for the foreseeable future significant new joint venture acquisition and or other new business opportunity may require additional

in offshore cash we also expect to fund majority of the second tender offer step with offshore cash we have borrowed fund domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do at reasonable interest rate however additional borrowing would result in increased interest expense in the future we consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiary and equity investees of september to be indefinitely reinvested and accordingly no income and foreign withholding tax have been provided on such earnings we have not nor do we anticipate the need to repatriate fund to the to satisfy domestic liquidity need however in the event that we need to repatriate all or portion of our foreign cash to the we would be subject to additional income tax which could be material we do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation there is significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation including the availability and amount of foreign tax credit at the time of repatriation tax rate in effect and other indirect tax consequence associated with repatriation other than normal operating expense and funding the acquisition of starbucks japan

wa million for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the decrease wa driven by the first quarter payment of billion for the kraft arbitration matter discussed above this wa partially offset by cash provided by operating activity of billion primarily resulting from strong earnings and favorable change in working capital account in the current year cash used by investing activity totaled million for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal the change wa primarily due to cash paid to acquire teavana in the prior year also contributing wa an increase in our investment in long term security during fiscal more than offset by the subsequent liquidation of significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal in anticipation of funding the acquisition of starbucks japan cash used by financing activity for fiscal totaled million compared to million for fiscal the increase wa primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholder through share

accounting policiescritical accounting policy are those that management belief are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and result and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgment often result of the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption our significant accounting policy are discussed in note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included in item of part ii of this we believe that of our significant accounting policy the following policy involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity we consider financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment during the past three fiscal year we have not made any material change to the accounting methodology used to ass the area discussed below unless noted otherwise of contentsproperty plant and equipment and other definite lived assetswe evaluate property plant and equipment and other definite lived asset for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes it new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset remaining useful life long lived asset are grouped with other asset and liability at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level the fair value of store asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model for other long lived asset fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant fact and circumstance which may include discounted cash flow comparable transaction or comparable company analysis our impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flow and asset fair value key assumption used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair value include projected revenue growth and operating expense well forecasting asset useful life and selecting an appropriate discount rate for company operated store estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection and consider the store historical performance the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store performance the discount rate is selected based on we believe buyer would assume when determining purchase price for the store these estimate are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flow and asset fair value is affected by factor such ongoing maintenance and improvement of the asset change in economic condition and change in operating performance during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption that had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset primarily trade name and trademark for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group fair value is the price market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach such discounted cash flow or relief from royalty method if the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value our decision to perform qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in given year is influenced by number of factor inclusive of the size of the reporting unit goodwill the significance of the excess of the reporting unit estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessment during fiscal part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately million or of our total goodwill balance of million the majority of which resides in our china retail licensed and consumer packaged good reporting unit part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we may abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related asset if store closure are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closure occur of contentsour impairment calculation contain uncertainty because they require management to make assumption and to apply judgment when performing qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flow and asset fair value key assumption used in estimating future cash flow and asset fair value typically include projected revenue growth and operating expense related to existing business product innovation and new store concept well selecting an appropriate discount rate for indefinite lived intangible asset management also make assumption around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee for goodwill reporting unit estimate of revenue growth and operating expense are based on internal projection considering the reporting unit past performance and forecasted growth strategic initiative local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit performance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region for indefinite lived intangible asset estimate of revenue growth are based on internal projection considering the intangible asset group past performance and forecasted growth and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rate for similar licensing arrangement adjusted for our particular fact and circumstance the discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business these estimate are highly subjective judgment and our ability to realize the future cash flow used in our fair value calculation is affected by factor such the success of strategic initiative change in economic condition change in our operating performance and change in our business strategy for fiscal we determined the fair value of our material reporting unit and intangible asset group were significantly in excess of their carrying value accordingly we did not recognize any material impairment charge during the current fiscal year during fiscal there were no significant change in any of our estimate or assumption that had material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculation however we periodically reassess estimated future cash flow and asset fair value change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material impairment charge in the future income taxeswe recognize deferred tax asset and liability based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amount and the respective tax base of our asset and liability deferred tax asset and liability are measured using current enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to reverse we routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax asset and may record valuation allowance if based on all available evidence we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized change in tax law and rate may affect recorded deferred tax asset and liability and our effective tax rate in the future however we do not expect change from recently enacted tax law to be material to the consolidated financial statement in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax asset within the jurisdiction from which they arise we consider all available positive and negative evidence including scheduled reversal of deferred tax liability projected future taxable income tax planning strategy and result of recent operation in projecting future taxable income we consider historical result and incorporate assumption about the amount of future state federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for item that do not have tax consequence our assumption regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plan and estimate we are using to manage the underlying business in evaluating the objective evidence that historical result provide we consider three year of cumulative operating income loss in addition our income tax return are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authority these audit include review of our tax filing position including the timing and amount of deduction taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdiction we evaluate our exposure associated with our various tax filing position and recognize tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority including resolution of any related appeal or litigation process based on the technical merit of our position for uncertain tax position that do not meet this threshold we record related liability we adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled the statute of limitation expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available there is reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within month due to the expiration of statute of limitation however we do not expect this change to be material to the consolidated financial statement we have generated income in certain foreign jurisdiction that ha not been subject to income tax we intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future while we do not expect to repatriate cash to the to satisfy domestic liquidity need if these amount were distributed to the in the form of dividend or otherwise we would be subject to additional income tax which could be material determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these earnings is not practicable because such liability if any is dependent on circumstance existing if and when remittance occurs our income tax expense deferred tax asset and liability and liability for unrecognized tax benefit reflect management best assessment of estimated current and future tax to be paid deferred tax asset valuation allowance and our liability for unrecognized tax benefit require significant management judgment regarding applicable statute and their related interpretation the status of various income tax audit and our particular fact and circumstance although we believe that the of contentsjudgments and estimate discussed herein are reasonable actual result could differ and we may be exposed to loss or gain that could be material to the extent we prevail in matter for which liability ha been established or are required to pay amount in excess of our established liability our effective income tax rate in given financial statement period could be

recorded or disclosed at fair value on recurring basis we determine fair value based on the following level the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent approximates fair value because of the short term nature of these instrument for trading and government treasury security and commodity future contract we use quoted price in active market for identical asset to determine fair value level when quoted price in active market for identical asset are not available we determine the fair value of our available for sale security and our over the counter forward contract collar and swap based upon factor such the quoted market price of similar asset or discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data which may include interest rate curve and forward and spot price for currency

depreciation is computed using the straight line method over estimated useful life of the asset generally ranging from to year for equipment and to year for building leasehold improvement are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the related lease life generally year for lease with renewal period at our option we generally use the original lease term excluding renewal option period to determine estimated useful life if failure to exercise renewal option imposes an economic penalty to we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful life the portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facility is included in cost of sale including occupancy cost in the consolidated statement of earnings the cost of repair and maintenance are expensed when incurred while expenditure for refurbishment and improvement that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized when asset are disposed of whether through retirement or sale the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value le estimated cost to sell we evaluate property plant and equipment for impairment when fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable when evaluating for impairment we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the estimated undiscounted future cash flow are le than the carrying value of the asset we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset carrying value exceeds it estimated fair value the fair value of the asset is estimated using discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenue and operating cost using internal projection property plant and equipment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for company operated store asset the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level we recognized net disposition charge of million million and million and net impairment charge of million million and million in fiscal and respectively the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired

expense goodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change such material deterioration in performance or significant number of store closure that would indicate that impairment may exist when evaluating goodwill for impairment we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that reporting unit is impaired if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using discounted cash flow model if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value part of our ongoing operation we may close certain store within reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease among other reason we may abandon certain asset associated with closed store including leasehold improvement and other non transferable asset when portion of reporting unit that constitutes business is to be disposed of goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal our evaluation of whether the portion of reporting unit being disposed of constitutes business occurs on the date of abandonment although an operating store meet the accounting definition of business prior to abandonment it doe not constitute business on the closure date because the remaining asset on that date do not constitute an integrated set of asset that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing return to investor result when closing individual store we do not include goodwill

intangible asset group is impaired if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group fair value is the price willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using an income approach such relief from royalty model if the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value in addition we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful life if and when fact and circumstance change definite lived intangible asset which mainly consist
