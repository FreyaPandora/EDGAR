competitive environment number of our marketed product are indicated in disease area in which other product or treatment are currently available or are being pursued by our competitor through research and development activity additionally competitor marketed product target the same genetic pathway our recently launched marketed product or are being pursued currently this competition could impact the pricing and market share of our product we continue to pursue way to increase the value of our medicine through innovation during their life cycle which can include expanding the disease area for which our product are indicated and finding new method to make the delivery of our medicine easier and le costly such activity can offer important opportunity for differentiation for example in we launched the neulasta onpro kit which provides physician the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of neulasta on the same day chemotherapy with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy thereby saving patient trip back to the doctor we also launched in the autotouch reusable auto injector to be used with enbrel mini single dose prefilled cartridge mg ml the enbrel mini utilizes new drug formulation of enbrel that wa associated with statistically significant lower mean injection site pain than the current formulation we plan to continue pursuing innovation effort to strengthen our competitive position such position may be based on among other thing safety efficacy reliability availability patient convenience delivery device price reimbursement access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration certain of the existing patent on our principal product have expired and we face new and increasing competition including from biosimilars and generic we may also compete biosimilar or generic version of our competitor product biosimilar is another version of biological product for which marketing approval is sought or ha been obtained based on demonstration that it is highly similar to the original reference product we expect that the adverse impact on our product sale from biosimilar competition will be more like branded biologic competition than that seen when branded small molecule face generic but we believe that when multiple biosimilar version of one of our product get approved and launched competition could intensify more rapidly resulting in greater impact on our product sale although we expect biosimilars to compete on price we believe many patient provider and payer will continue to place high value on the reputation reliability and safety of our product in the united state company now have approved biosimilar version of epogen neupogen neulasta and enbrel see also government regulation regulation in the united state approval of biosimilars biosimilar competitor come to market we will leverage both the experience we have in the united state versus branded competition and our experience in competing against epoetin alfa and filgrastim biosimilars in europe in addition although of our product are biologics some of our product are small molecule product the fda approval process allows generic manufacturer to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than to conduct their own costly and time consuming clinical trial generic manufacturer can often market their competing version of our small molecule product at much lower price result upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for small molecule product we can lose the majority of revenue for that product in short period of time the introduction of new product the development of new process or technology by competitor or the emergence of new information about existing product may result in increased competition for our marketed product even for those protected by patent or in reduction in the price we receive from selling our product in addition the development of new treatment option or standard of care may reduce the use of our product or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trial for our product candidate used in this document the term clinical trial may include prospective clinical trial observational study registry and other study see item risk factor our product face substantial competition and item risk factor we currently face

our composition of matter patent for sensipar expired in march we are engaged in litigation with number of company seeking to market generic version of sensipar surrounding our formulation patent that expires in september see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement for further information several of these generic version of sensipar have been approved by the fda subsidiary of pfizer inc pfizer subsidiary of takeda pharmaceutical company limited kyprolis is facing increased competition from several recently approved product sale of our principal product are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer in many market around the world these payer including government health system private health insurer and other organization remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare and their effort have intensified result of rising healthcare cost and economic challenge drug and in particular specialty drug such our product remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment result payer are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical product and scrutinizing the price of these product requiring higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefit such product bring to patient and the broader healthcare system these pressure are intensified our product are subject to increasing competition in the united state healthcare provider and other entity such pharmacy and pharmacy benefit manager pbms are reimbursed for covered service and product deliver through medicare medicaid and other government healthcare program well through private payer we are required to provide rebate or discount on our product that are reimbursed through certain government program including medicare and medicaid and also provide discount to qualifying healthcare provider under the federal drug pricing program in addition we provide rebate to pbms well other entity such hospital and pharmacy which are payment by biopharmaceutical manufacturer of portion of the product purchase price back to the pbms or other entity biopharmaceutical product pricing remains central to discussion on controlling healthcare cost in the united state policy maker from both of the major political party are pursuing policy to lower drug cost for patient in may president donald trump and administration released drug pricing blueprint and requested public comment on an array of policy idea intended to increase competition improve the federal government negotiating power reduce drug price and lower patient out of pocket cost the blueprint included number of policy idea with the potential to significantly affect whether individually or collectively the biopharmaceutical industry and the presidential administration ha already begun to implement certain element described in the administration drug pricing blueprint such seeking initial feedback on potential program that would set the medicare payment amount for part single source drug and biologics to be more closely aligned with international drug price and rely on third party vendor ii issuing guidance to allow certain medicare plan offered by private insurance company to begin requiring that patient receiving medicare part drug first try drug preferred by the plan such plan will cover another therapy iii lowering initial reimbursement rate for new part drug launched beginning in and iv proposing new rule to require drug price information in direct to consumer drug television advertising the blueprint also discussed the potential removal of the safe harbor protection under the federal anti kickback statute for drug rebate paid to payer and ii change to the part program at the same time value assessment of new technology previously used predominantly outside the united state are having an impact in the healthcare environment healthcare provider organization and independent organization are creating their own value assessment of biopharmaceutical drug for comparison with manufacturer pricing although these organization not set drug price they seek to influence pricing well payer and provider decision making by publicly disclosing their assessment often making assertion around they believe to be the appropriate price to charge for product in addition continued consolidation of payer and integration of provider and payer integrated delivery system increase the level of market power held by our customer such development particularly when taken in combination with increasing product competition put greater pressure on access to pricing of and sale of our product in addition rebate and or discount level well the number of entity that are entitled to receive since they are reimbursed through government program have increased time for example the bipartisan budget act enacted in requires biopharmaceutical manufacturer to pay greater discount for patient in the medicare part coverage gap beginning in and the patient protection and affordable care act aca enacted in increased many of the mandatory discount and rebate required of the aca also imposed new branded prescription pharmaceutical manufacturer and importer fee payable each year by and other manufacturer in the tax cut and job act tax act signed by president trump in december congress removed key aca provision by repealing the individual mandate penalty which required every person to have health insurance or pay penalty future change to government program such the aca whether legislative or regulatory could impact the number of patient life covered could raise or lower the cost or quality of insurance could affect medicaid eligibility and could change level of patient protection provided unless alternative are put in place other government legislative and regulatory action that would have significant impact on amgen include change to the medicare program cover and reimburses current and future drug including for patient with end stage renal disease esrd change in the federal payment rate or new rebate requirement for covered drug and policy for drug payment in medicare or medicaid and change to coverage and payment for biosimilars such policy that would facilitate easier substitution for or provide reimbursement advantage over the corresponding innovative product in esrd the center for medicare medicaid service cm us bundled payment system and recently finalized change allowing more new dialysis drug to be eligible for temporary add on payment adjustment starting in sensipar and parsabiv already eligible for add on payment adjustment beginning in and will continue to receive them in cm ha indicated interest in testing new model for drug payment in medicare part and part cm also continues to test alternative payment model with provider such the care model these model provide financial incentive for provider who participate under the model provider take on greater risk for the overall cost and quality of care in addition in cm implemented change to medicare payment to hospital for part drug acquired through the federal drug pricing program but provided financial incentive for hospital to use biosimilar product over the corresponding innovative product described cm is permitting medicare advantage plan to implement access control for part drug while also considering proposal that would set the medicare payment amount for part single source drug and biologics to more closely align with international drug price and rely on third party vendor and ii considering change to medicare part and medicare advantage these and or other change have the potential to impact prescribing and patient access to amgen therapy additional effort by state legislature and government agency in the united state could also affect and our industry for example california law requires manufacturer to provide payer advance notice of price increase over specified threshold and law in oregon and vermont require manufacturer to submit price increase justification to state attorney agency if certain price increase and state spending threshold are met example of other proposal that have been discussed and debated but not yet enacted include state ballot initiative that would place maximum price ceiling or cap on pharmaceutical product purchased by state agency and state legislative effort to cap pharmaceutical price for commercial payer in the private sector payer continue to institute cost reduction and containment measure that lower drug utilization and or spending altogether and or shift greater portion of the cost to patient such measure include more limited benefit plan design higher patient co pay or coinsurance obligation limitation on patient use of commercial manufacturer co pay payment assistance program including through co pay accumulator adjustment or maximization program stricter utilization management criterion before patient may get access to drug and or higher tier formulary placement that increase the level of patient out of pocket cost the use of such measure by pbms and insurer that handle the majority of sale for enbrel and repatha ha continued to intensify and thereby limited amgen product usage and sale consolidation ha resulted in smaller number of pbms and insurer overseeing large portion of total covered life in the united state result pbms and insurer have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criterion and or exclude drug from their formulary in favor of competitor drug or alternative treatment our past experience with repatha underscore that utilization management requirement including the burdensome administrative process required of physician to demonstrate and document that patient meet such requirement continue to be significant challenge for patient and physician limiting access for appropriate usage formulary exclusion effectively encourages patient and provider to seek alternative treatment or pay of the cost of drug drug inclusion and favorable positioning on formulary is essential to ensure patient have access even when access is available some patient abandon their prescription due to economic reason in highly competitive treatment market such with enbrel repatha and aimovig pbms are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebate from manufacturer in order to maintain their formulary position in many country outside the united state government sponsored healthcare system are the primary payer for drug and biologics with increasing budgetary constraint and or difficulty in understanding the value of medicine government and payer in many country are applying variety of measure to exert downward price pressure these measure can include mandatory price control price referencing therapeutic reference pricing increase in mandate incentive for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government mandated price cut in this regard many country have health technology assessment organization that use formal economic metric such cost effectiveness to determine price coverage and reimbursement of new therapy and these organization are expanding in established and emerging market we expect that country will continue to take aggressive action to seek to reduce expenditure on drug and biologics similarly fiscal constraint may also affect the extent to which country are willing to approve new and innovative therapy and or allow access to new technology the dynamic and development discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our product and the industry we remain focused on delivering breakthrough treatment for unmet medical need amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicine we do this by investing billion of dollar annually in developing more affordable therapeutic choice in the form of high quality and reliably supplied biosimilars pricing our medicine to reflect the value they provide partnering with payer to share risk and accountability for health outcome providing patient support and education program and helping patient in financial need access our medicine and working with policy maker patient and other stakeholder to establish sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patient and their healthcare professional are the primary decision maker item risk factor our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability and item risk factor guideline and recommendation published by various organization can reduce the use of our product manufacturing distribution and raw materialsmanufacturingwe believe we are leader in the manufacturing of biologics and that our manufacturing capability represent competitive advantage the product we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drug the majority of our product are biologics that are produced in living cell and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variation highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory scale process into reproducible commercial manufacturing process further our expertise in manufacturing of biologics position well for leadership in the global biosimilars market for additional information regarding manufacturing facility see item property our internal manufacturing network ha the commercial production capability of bulk manufacturing formulation fill finish and device assembly these activity are performed within the united state and it territory in our puerto rico rhode island and california facility well internationally in our ireland netherlands and singapore facility in addition we utilize third party contract manufacturer to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network to support our clinical trial we manufacture product candidate primarily at our california and to lesser extent our rhode island facility we also utilize third party contract manufacturer for certain clinical product see item risk factor for discussion of the factor that could adversely impact our manufacturing operation and the global supply of our product distributionwe operate distribution center in puerto rico kentucky california and the netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical product we also use third party distributor to supplement distribution of our product worldwide otherin addition to the manufacturing and distribution activity noted above each of our manufacturing location also includes key manufacturing support function including quality control process development procurement production scheduling and warehousing certain of those manufacturing and distribution activity are highly regulated by the fda well other international regulatory agency see government regulation regulation in the united state regulation of manufacturing standard manufacturing initiativeswe have multiple ongoing initiative that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and or mitigating risk while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our product in our next generation biomanufacturing plant in singapore wa licensed by the fda and the ema for certain commercial scale production in we successfully completed additional bulk process qualification campaign which if approved would permit the commercial production of an additional product at that site next generation biomanufacturing plant incorporates multiple innovative technology into single facility and therefore can be built in half the construction time with approximately one half of the operating cost of traditional plant next generation biomanufacturing plant require smaller manufacturing footprint and offer greater environmental benefit including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower level of carbon emission within the plant the equipment is portable and smaller and some component are disposable which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicine simultaneously this eliminates costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plant and allows amgen to respond to changing demand for it medicine with increased agility ultimately impacting the speed at which medicine is available for patient the singapore site also ha plant with the capability to produce small molecule drug when approved by relevant regulatory authority this plant can be used for commercial manufacturing in july we announced the groundbreaking of our new next generation biomanufacturing plant that will be constructed at our west greenwich rhode island campus the new plant is expected to be the first of it kind in the united state and will use our next generation biomanufacturing capability after construction ha been completed and upon approval by the fda and other global regulatory authority this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain product for and global market see item risk factor manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale material and medical devicescertain raw material medical device including companion diagnostics and component necessary for the commercial and or clinical manufacturing of our product are provided by and are the proprietary product of unaffiliated third party supplier certain of which may be our only source for such material we currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such supplier by inventory management relationship management and evaluation of alternative source when feasible we also monitor the financial condition of certain supplier and their ability to supply our need see item risk factor we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component we perform various procedure to help authenticate the source of raw material including intermediary material used in the manufacture of our product which include verification of the country of origin the procedure are incorporated into the manufacturing process we and our third party contract manufacturer perform government regulationregulation by government authority in the united state and other country is significant factor in the production and marketing of our product and our ongoing activity in order to clinically test manufacture and market product for therapeutic use we must satisfy mandatory procedure and safety and effectiveness standard established by various regulatory body compliance with these standard is complex and failure to comply with any of these standard can result in significant implication see item risk factor for discussion of factor including global regulatory implication that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial product regulation in the united statesin the united state the public health service act the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and the regulation promulgated thereunder well other federal and state statute and regulation govern among other thing the production research development testing manufacture quality control labeling storage record keeping approval advertising promotion and distribution of our product well the reporting of certain payment and other transfer of value to healthcare professional and teaching hospital clinical development and product approval drug development in our industry is complex challenging and risky and failure rate are high product development cycle are typically very long approximately to year from discovery to market potential new medicine must undergo many year of preclinical and clinical testing to establish it safety and efficacy for use in human at appropriate dosing level and with an acceptable risk benefit profile after laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animal we file an investigational new drug application ind with the fda to begin human testing typically we undertake an fda designated three phase human clinical testing program in phase we conduct small clinical trial to investigate the safety and proper dose range of our product candidate in small number of human subject in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate side effect profile and the efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study in phase we conduct clinical trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of our product candidate in large number of patient who have the disease or condition under study the fda monitor the progress of each trial conducted under an ind and may at it discretion reevaluate alter suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the fda risk benefit assessment with regard to the patient enrolled in the trial the result of preclinical and clinical trial are submitted to the fda in the form of either bla for biologic product or new drug application for small molecule product we are not permitted to market or promote new product the fda ha approved our marketing application approval of biosimilars the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway the pathway allows sponsor of biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical and clinical trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar ha been demonstrated to be highly similar and to have no clinically meaningful difference in term of safety purity and potency the relevance of demonstrating similarity is that in many case biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trial typically required of originator risk benefit ha previously been established in order to preserve incentive for future innovation the law establishes period of exclusivity for originator product which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining fda approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator data in their application to the fda for year after initial fda approval of the originator product the law not change the duration of patent granted on biologic product the fda ha released number of guidance document part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars some of which remain in draft form of the end of biosimilar application have been approved by the fda including our product amjevitatm biosimilar candidate to humira adalimumab and mvasitm biosimilar candidate to avastin bevacizumab well competitor to our product enbrel aranesp epogen neupogen and neulasta number of manufacturer have announced the filing of marketing application to the fda under the biosimilar pathway some of which are for biosimilars of our product regulation of product marketing and promotion the fda regulates the marketing and promotion of drug product our product promotion for approved product indication must comply with the statutory standard of the fdca and the fda implementing regulation and guidance the fda review of marketing and promotional activity encompasses but is not limited to direct to consumer advertising healthcare provider directed advertising and promotion sale representative communication to healthcare professional promotional programming and promotional activity involving electronic medium the fda may also review industry sponsored scientific and educational activity that make representation regarding product safety or efficacy in promotional context the fda may take enforcement action against company for promoting unapproved us of product or for other violation of it advertising and labeling law and regulation enforcement action may include product seizure injunction civil or criminal penalty or regulatory letter which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communication to healthcare professional failure to comply with the fda regulation also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activity by the congress or other legislator additionally described such failure may lead to additional liability under health care fraud and abuse law regulation of manufacturing standard the fda regulates and inspects equipment facility laboratory and process used in the manufacturing and testing of product prior to providing approval to market product if after receiving approval from the fda we make material change in manufacturing equipment location or process additional regulatory review may be required we also must adhere to current good manufacturing practice regulation and product specific regulation enforced by the fda through it facility inspection program the fda conduct regular periodic visit to reinspect our equipment facility laboratory and process following an initial approval regulation of combination product combination product are defined by the fda to include product composed of two or more regulated component biologic and or drug and device biologics drug and device each have their own regulatory requirement and combination product may have additional requirement number of our marketed product meet this definition and are regulated under this framework and we expect that number of our pipeline product candidate will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework well regulation outside the united statesin the european union eu country well switzerland canada australia and japan regulatory requirement and approval process are similar in principle to those in the united state in the eu are currently two potential track for seeking marketing approval for product not authorized in any eu member state decentralized procedure and centralized procedure in the decentralized procedure identical application for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agency regulatory review is led by one member state the reference member state and it assessment based on safety quality and efficacy is reviewed and approved assuming there are no concern that the product pose serious risk to public health by the other member state from which the applicant is seeking approval the concerned member state the decentralized procedure lead to series of single national approval in all relevant country in the centralized procedure which is required of all product derived from biotechnology company submits single maa to the ema which conduct an evaluation of the dossier drawing upon it scientific resource across europe if the drug product is proven to fulfill the requirement for quality safety and efficacy the ema chmp adopts positive opinion which is transmitted to the ec for final decision on grant of the marketing authorization while the ec generally follows the chmp opinion it is not bound to do subsequent commercialization is enabled by country by country reimbursement approval in the eu biosimilars are approved under specialized pathway of the centralized procedure with the pathway applicant seek and obtain regulatory approval for biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product ha expired relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is highly similar in term of quality safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the european economic area result of the united kingdom vote to leave the eu in march the ema announced that it will relocate it headquarters from london to amsterdam by march while negotiation continue regarding the term of the united kingdom withdrawal from the eu the specific impact to the supervision regulation and supply of medicine in the united kingdom and europe remain unclear country such russia turkey and those in latin america and the middle east have review process and data requirement similar to those of the eu and in some case can rely on prior marketing approval from or eu regulatory authority the regulatory process in these country may include manufacturing testing facility inspection testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirement in asia pacific number of country such china japan south korea and taiwan may require local clinical trial data for bridging purpose part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trial which can add to overall drug development and registration timeline in most of the asian market registration timeline depend on marketing approval in the united state or the eu in some market in asia such china thailand and indonesia the regulatory timeline can be le predictable the regulatory process may also include manufacturing testing facility inspection testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirement country such australia and japan have more mature system that would allow for submission in more competitive time frame regarding biosimilars several of these country have pathway to register biosimilars south korea india australia singapore and taiwan and biosimilar product are already present on the market australia and south korea in some country such japan and those in the eu medical device may be subject to regulatory regime whereby the manufacturer must establish that it medical device conforms to essential requirement set out in the law for the particular device category for example in the eu with limited exception medical device placed on the market must bear the conformité européenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirement post approval phaseafter approval we continue to monitor adverse event and product complaint reported following the use of our product through routine post marketing surveillance and study when applicable we report such event to the appropriate regulatory agency required per local regulation for individual case and aggregate report we proactively monitor according to good pharmacovigilance practice and ensure implementation of signal detection assessment and the communication of adverse event that may be associated with the use of our product we also proactively monitor product complaint through our quality system which includes assessing our drug delivery device for device complaint adverse event and malfunction we may also be required by regulatory agency to conduct further clinical trial on our marketed product condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy health authority including the fda have authority to mandate labeling change to product at any point in product lifecycle based on new safety information or part of an evolving label change to particular class of product health authority including the fda also have the authority before or after approval to require company to implement risk management program for product to ensure that the benefit of the drug outweigh the risk each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factor required in the united state risk management program is known risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rem and we currently have rem for

breadth of the statutory provision and the absence of guidance in the form of regulation or court decision addressing some of our practice it is possible that in the future our practice might be further challenged under anti kickback or similar law additionally the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa prohibits corporation and their representative from offering promising authorizing or making payment to any foreign government official government staff member political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad the scope of the fcpa arguably includes

government regulation regulation in the united state clinical development and product approval for discussion of government regulation over clinical development also see item risk factor we must conduct clinical trial in human before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication some of our competitor are actively engaged in in area in which we have product or in which we are developing product candidate or new indication for existing product for example we compete with other clinical trial for eligible patient which may limit the number of available patient who meet the criterion for certain clinical trial the competitive marketplace for our product candidate is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market early entry may have important advantage in gaining product acceptance thereby contributing to product eventual success and profitability accordingly we expect that in some case the relative speed with which we can develop product complete clinical testing receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantity of product to the market will be important to our competitive position in addition to product

geopolitical event and international operation further additional risk not currently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business operation liquidity and stock price our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability sale of our product depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third party payer including government healthcare program and private insurance plan government and private payer continue to pursue initiative to contain cost and manage drug utilization these payer are increasingly focused on the effectiveness benefit and cost of similar treatment which could result for our product in lower reimbursement rate or narrower population for payer will reimburse continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drug and other healthcare cost together with payer dynamic may limit our ability to set or adjust the price of our product based on their value which could have material adverse effect on our business in the united state the public discussion of drug pricing issue are likely to continue changing federal coverage and reimbursement policy and practice have impacted and may continue to impact access to and sale of our productsa substantial portion of our business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare program and commercial insurance plan regulated by the federal and state government see item business reimbursement our business ha and will continue to be impacted by legislative action changing federal reimbursement policy for example in february the congress passed legislation requiring biopharmaceutical manufacturer to provide greater discount beginning in on product dispensed to patient in the coverage gap the initial coverage limit of medicare part and the program catastrophic coverage threshold which will reduce our net product sale relating to such patient additional legislative proposal have been introduced by member of congress to overhaul provision of the patient protection and aca to allow commercial level importation of prescription medication from canada or other country and to enable medicare to negotiate drug price with biopharmaceutical manufacturer congressional focus on drug pricing ha increased since the democrat took control of the house of representative in november for example in january the chair of the house oversight and reform committee sent letter to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturer including amgen seeking document and detailed information about such company drug pricing both that committee and the senate finance committee held committee hearing in january on the topic of drug pricing and have indicated that further committee hearing on the topic are likely also our business ha been and is expected to continue to be impacted by change in federal reimbursement policy resulting from executive action federal regulation or federal demonstration project for example in may the presidential administration released drug pricing blueprint and requested public comment on an array of policy idea intended to increase competition improve the negotiating power of the federal government reduce drug price and lower patient out of pocket cost this blueprint includes number of policy idea with the potential to significantly impact whether individually or collectively our industry such proposal include moving coverage and reimbursement for medicare part drug into medicare instituting competitive acquisition program for part drug in which competing third party vendor take on the financial risk of acquiring drug and billing medicare removing the safe harbor protection under the federal anti kickback statute for drug rebate paid to payer and requiring the inclusion of drug price information in direct to consumer drug advertising since that time the president and or federal agency such cm have announced number of demonstration project recommendation and proposal to implement various element described in the drug pricing blueprint cm the federal agency responsible for administering medicare and overseeing state medicaid program and health insurance marketplace ha substantial power to implement policy change or demonstration project that can quickly and significantly affect how drug including our product are covered and reimbursed for example in october president trump announced that cm wa evaluating pilot program proposed to initially cover fifty percent of spending on part single source drug referred to the international price index that would among other thing set the medicare payment amount for such single source drug to more closely align with international drug price cm ha taken additional action to implement other element described in the administration drug pricing blueprint including issuing guidance to allow certain medicare plan offered by private insurance company to require that patient receiving medicare part drug first try drug preferred by the plan before such plan will cover another therapy and proposing lower reimbursement rate for new part drug and on january the department of health and human service released proposal to revise the federal anti kickback statute safe harbor regulation to exclude from safe harbor protection certain rebate and other form of remuneration paid by manufacturer of prescription drug to medicaid managed care organization or plan sponsor under medicare part either directly or through pbms further cm ha undertaken demonstration project to test care model such the cm oncology care model which provides participating physician practice with performance based financial incentive that aim to manage or reduce medicare cost without negatively impacting the efficacy of care we believe the oncology care model ha reduced utilization of certain of our oncology product by participating physician practice and may continue to do so in the future in addition cm ha solicited suggestion regarding other potential care model in this dynamic environment we are unable to predict which or how many of these various federal policy legislative or regulatory change may ultimately be enacted to the extent that these or other federal government initiative decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our product limit our ability to offer co pay payment assistance to commercial patient require that we pay increased rebate or shift other cost to limit or impact our decision regarding the pricing of biopharmaceutical product or otherwise reduce the use of our product such action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we also face risk relating to the reporting of pricing data that affect the reimbursement of and discount provided for our product government price reporting regulation are complex and may require manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data if our submitted pricing data are incorrect we may become subject to substantial fine and penalty or other government enforcement action which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition result of restating previously reported price data we also may be required to pay additional rebate and provide additional discount changing state reimbursement and pricing action may impact access to and have impacted and may continue to impact sale of our productsat the state level government action or ballot initiative can also affect how our product are covered and reimbursed and or create additional pressure on our pricing decision number of state have adopted and many other state have discussed and debated and are considering new pricing action including proposal designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturer to publicly report proprietary pricing information limit price increase or to place maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical product existing and proposed state pricing law have added complexity to the pricing of drug and may already be impacting industry pricing decision for example in october california enacted drug pricing transparency bill that requires biopharmaceutical manufacturer to notify health insurer and government health plan at least day before scheduled prescription drug price increase that exceed certain threshold other state are seeking to change the way their state pay for drug for patient covered by state program for example in august the ohio department of medicaid ordered that all the state medicaid managed care plan terminate and renegotiate contract with pbms to eliminate the drug purchasing model in which pbms bill the state more than they reimburse pharmacist for filling medicaid patient prescription in january california governor issued an executive order expanding state medicaid coverage and directing state agency and program to consolidate drug purchase and to negotiate drug price with manufacturer other state could adopt similar approach or could pursue different policy change in continuing effort to reduce their cost ultimately with federal government action existing or future state government action or ballot initiative may also have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation commercial payer action have impacted and may continue to impact access to and sale of our productspayers including healthcare insurer pbms and group purchasing organization increasingly seek way to reduce their and their respective member cost with increasing frequency payer are adopting benefit plan change that shift greater portion of drug cost to patient such measure include more limited benefit plan design high deductible plan higher patient co pay or coinsurance obligation and limitation on patient use of manufacturer commercial co pay payment assistance program including through co pay accumulator adjustment or maximization program payer have sought and will likely continue to seek price discount or rebate in connection with the placement of our product on their formulary or those they manage particularly in treatment area where the payer ha taken the position that multiple branded product are therapeutically comparable payer also control cost by imposing restriction on access to or usage of our product such requiring that patient first try drug preferred by the payer or receive the payer prior authorization before covering the product or that patient use mail order pharmacy or mail order pharmacy or limited network of fully owned specialty pharmacy payer may also choose to exclude certain indication for which our product are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely for example the burdensome administrative process required for physician to demonstrate or document that the patient for whom repatha ha been prescribed meet payer utilization management criterion ha limited and may continue to limit patient access to repatha treatment in an effort to reduce barrier to access we reduced the net price of repatha by providing greater discount and rebate to payer including pbms that administer medicare part prescription drug plan however affordability of patient out of pocket co pay cost ha and may continue to limit patient use for example very high percentage of medicare patient have abandoned their repatha prescription rather than pay their co pay payment in late and early we introduced set of new ndcs to make repatha available at lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patient particularly those on medicare despite the recent net and list price reduction payer may continue to restrict patient access change formulary coverage for repatha seek further discount or rebate or take other action that could reduce our sale of repatha further our introduction of the new ndcs may not be rapidly adopted by payer which could continue to limit patient use and could also reduce our sale of repatha significant consolidation in the health insurance industry ha resulted in large insurer and pbms exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiation with drug manufacturer significantly increasing discount and rebate required of manufacturer and limiting patient access and usage for example in the united state the top three pbms now oversee greater than two third of prescription claim well government and commercial covered life the consolidation among insurer pbms and other payer including through integrated delivery system and or with specialty or mail order pharmacy and pharmacy retailer ha increased the negotiating leverage such entity have over and other drug manufacturer and ha resulted in greater price discount rebate and fee for other service being realized by those payer for example during the fourth quarter of two of the nation largest pbms express script and cv health completed their combination with major insurance company cigna and aetna respectively additional consolidation would further increase the leverage of such entity ultimately additional discount rebate coverage or plan change restriction or exclusion imposed by these commercial payer could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation government and commercial payer action outside the united state have impacted and will continue to impact access to and sale of our product outside the united state we expect country will continue to take action to reduce their drug expenditure see item business reimbursement international reference pricing irp ha been widely used by many country outside the united state to control cost based on an external benchmark of product price in other country irp policy can quickly and frequently change and may not reflect difference in the burden of disease indication market structure or affordability difference across country or region in addition country may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for product when their national health technology assessment do not consider medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapy or that it doe not meet certain cost effectiveness threshold for example despite the ema may approval of repatha for the treatment of patient with established atherosclerotic disease reimbursement for repatha in france and germany ha remained limited to narrower patient population such those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia following national health technology assessment in mid while the pricing and reimbursement process in those country remains ongoing these assessment currently limit our effort in france and germany to expand repatha access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our product deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement or decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payer to physician and other provider could negatively impact the ability or willingness of healthcare provider to prescribe our product for their patient or could otherwise negatively affect the use of our product or the price we receive for them such change could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generic in the future we currently face competition from biosimilars in both europe and the united state and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and or generic competition this year and beyond expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent right or of an applicable exclusivity period would accelerate such competition and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and or scope of our patent our product may also experience greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generic that come to market when branded product that compete with our product lose their own patent protection to the extent that government adopt more permissive approval framework and competitor are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generic the rate of increased competition for our product could accelerate in the eu biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to set of general and product class specific guideline in addition in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and or increase potential healthcare saving some eu country have adopted and others are attempting to adopt biosimilar uptake measure such requiring physician prescribing quota or promoting switching or pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference product and other country may adopt similar measure some eu country impose automatic price reduction upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitor while the degree of competitive impact of biosimilar competition differs between eu country and between product in the eu the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sale of innovative product are being impacted by biosimilar competition is increasing in the united state the aca authorized the fda to approve biosimilars via separate abbreviated pathway see item business government regulation regulation in the united state approval of biosimilars the first biosimilar entrant into the market sandoz zarxio is biosimilar version of neupogen and wa launched in the united state in since then the fda ha approved additional biosimilars including biosimilar version of enbrel neulasta and epogen and growing number of company have announced that they are also developing biosimilar version of our product two biosimilar version of neulasta are now marketed in the united state and others may receive approval in impact to our neulasta sale could accelerate additional competitor are launched see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product competition the approved biosimilar version of epogen ha also launched in the united state and we are currently involved in patent litigation with the manufacturer of the approved version of enbrel manufacturer of biosimilars may attempt to compete with our product by offering lower list price greater discount or rebate or contract that offer longer term pricing or broader portfolio of other product company pursuing development of biosimilar version of our product have challenged and may continue to challenge our patent well in advance of the expiration of our material patent for information related to our biosimilars and generic patent litigation see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement see our intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation the pathway includes the option for biosimilar product that meet certain criterion to be approved interchangeable with their reference product some company currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to register their product interchangeable biosimilars which could make it easier for pharmacist to substitute those biosimilars for our reference product or could encourage prescribers or payer who are inclined to select the interchangeable biosimilar over our innovative product or our biosimilars in addition critic of the year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and or to encourage the fda to interpret narrowly the law provision regarding which new product receive data exclusivity for example the fda is considering whether subsequent change to licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product original year exclusivity period concept known in the generic drug context umbrella exclusivity if the fda were to decide that umbrella exclusivity doe not apply to biological reference product or were to make other change to the exclusivity period this could expose to biosimilar competition at an earlier time there also have been and may continue to be public legislative and fda effort to promote price competition through policy enabling easier generic and biosimilar entry including effort to lower standard for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability and provide greater clarity for how to do so and through change to the reimbursement policy for biologics upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for one of our small molecule product we can lose the majority of revenue for that product in very short period of time see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product competition our composition of matter patent for sensipar small molecule product expired in march we are engaged in litigation with number of company seeking to market generic version of sensipar surrounding our formulation patent that expires in september several of these generic version of sensipar have been approved by the fda and the manufacturer of one of the approved generic version began selling it product in late before reaching settlement agreement with in early january we were subsequently sued by manufacturer of another approved generic version of sensipar who is contending that provision of it own settlement agreement with amgen have been triggered by the first manufacturer at risk launch giving this second manufacturer right to market it own generic version under it settlement agreement see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement while no generic version of sensipar are currently available for sale one or more other company may elect to launch their approved generic version at risk prior to the conclusion of our ongoing litigation or may seek and obtain judicial declaration that they are permitted to launch their generic version if this happens our product sale for sensipar could be materially and adversely affected while we are unable to predict the precise impact of biosimilars and generic on our product we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the united state europe and elsewhere this year and beyond result of biosimilar and competition and downward pressure on our product price and sale this competition ha had and could increasingly have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation our product face substantial competition we operate in highly competitive environment see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product competition we expect that our product will compete with new drug currently in development drug currently approved for other indication that may later be approved for the same indication those of our product and drug approved for other indication that are used label large pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer of pharmaceutical product are expanding into the biotechnology field and some pharmaceutical company and generic manufacturer have formed partnership to pursue biosimilars in addition some of our competitor may have technical competitive or other advantage over for the development of technology and process or greater experience in particular therapeutic area and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can enhance such advantage these advantage may make it difficult for to compete with them to successfully discover develop and market new product and for our current product to compete with new product or new product indication they may bring to market result our product may compete against product that offer higher rebate or discount lower price equivalent or superior performance better safety profile easier administration earlier market availability or other competitive feature if we are unable to compete effectively this could reduce sale which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our intellectual property position may be challenged invalidated or circumvented or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent right and other intellectual property right that are important to the commercialization of our product and product candidate the patent position of pharmaceutical and biotechnology company can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal scientific and factual question driven by cost pressure effort to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing third party may challenge invalidate or circumvent our patent and patent application relating to our product product candidate and technology challenge to patent may come from potential competitor or from party other than those who seek to market potentially infringing product in addition our patent position might not protect against competitor with similar product or technology because competing product or technology may not infringe our patent for certain of our product candidate there are third party who have patent or pending patent application that they may claim necessitate payment of royalty or prevent from commercializing these product candidate in certain territory patent dispute are frequent costly and can preclude delay or increase the cost of commercialization of product we have been in the past and are currently and expect to be in the future involved in patent litigation these matter have included and may in the future include litigation with manufacturer of product that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our product for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provision of the biologics price competition and innovation act determination made by court agency or tribunal concerning infringement validity enforceability injunctive or economic remedy or the right to patent protection for example are typically subject to appellate or administrative review upon review such initial determination may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceeding patent dispute or litigation may not discourage potential violator from bringing the allegedly infringing product to market prior to final resolution of the dispute or litigation the period from inception until resolution of patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending we may be subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the loss damage and harm we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail moreover if we lose or settle current or future litigation at certain stage or entirely we could be subject to competition and or significant liability be required to enter into third party license for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute in addition we can not guarantee that such license will be available on term acceptable to or at all further under the hatch waxman act our product approved by the fda under the fdca may be the subject of patent litigation with generic competitor before expiry of the five year period of data exclusivity provided for under the hatch waxman act and prior to the expiration of the patent listed for the product likewise our innovative biologic product may be the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patent and with respect to competitor seeking approval biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product prior to the year exclusivity period provided under the aca in addition we are facing patent litigation involving claim that the biosimilar product candidate we are working to develop infringe the patent of other company that manufacture market or sell the applicable reference product for example we are currently engaged in litigation in the united state regarding mvasitm kanjintitm and amjevitatm and in europe we are engaged in litigation regarding amgevitatm while we may attempt to challenge the patent held by the company manufacturing marketing or selling the applicable reference product our effort may be unsuccessful alternatively such patent may contribute to decision by to not pursue all of the same labeled indication are held by these company for information related to our patent litigation see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement of the existing patent on our product have expired see item business marketing distribution and selected marketed product patent our patent expire competitor are able to legally produce and market similar product or technology including biosimilars which may have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in addition competitor may be able to invalidate design around or otherwise circumvent our patent and sell competing product guideline and recommendation published by various organization can reduce the use of our product government agency promulgate regulation and guideline directly applicable to and to our product professional society practice management group insurance carrier physician group private health and science foundation and organization involved in various disease also publish guideline and recommendation to healthcare provider administrator and payer well patient community recommendation by government agency or other group and organization may relate to such matter usage dosage route of administration and use of related therapy in addition growing number of organization are providing assessment of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical product and even organization whose guideline have historically been focused on clinical matter have begun to incorporate analysis of the cost effectiveness of various treatment into their treatment guideline and recommendation value assessment may come from private organization that publish their finding and offer recommendation relating to the product reimbursement by government and private payer some company and payer have announced pricing and payment decision based in part on the assessment of private organization for example cv caremark indicated in august that it will begin utilizing third party cost effectiveness analysis to make formulary and coverage determination for newly approved drug in addition government health technology assessment organization in many country make reimbursement recommendation to payer in their jurisdiction based on the clinical effectiveness cost effectiveness and service impact of new emerging and existing medicine and treatment such health technology assessment organization may recommend reimbursement for our product for narrower indication than wa approved by applicable regulatory agency or may recommend against reimbursement entirely such recommendation or guideline may affect our reputation and any recommendation or guideline that result in decreased use dosage or reimbursement of our product could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in addition the perception by the investment community or stockholder that such recommendation or guideline will result in decreased use and dosage of our product could adversely affect the market price of our common stock our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authority in the united state including the fda and by foreign regulatory authority including the ema we are required in the united state and in foreign country to obtain approval from regulatory authority before we manufacture market and sell our product once our product are approved the fda and other and foreign regulatory agency have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting perform inspection change product labeling or mandate withdrawal of our product failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirement may subject to administrative and or judicially imposed sanction or monetary penalty well reputational and other harm the sanction could include the fda or foreign regulatory authority refusal to approve pending application delay in obtaining or withdrawal of approval delay or suspension of clinical trial warning letter product recall or seizure total or partial suspension of our operation injunction fine civil penalty and or criminal prosecution obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval have been and will continue to be increasingly difficult time consuming and costly legislative body or regulatory agency could enact new law or regulation change existing law or regulation or change their interpretation of law or regulation at any time which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our product or product candidate the rate and degree of change in existing law and regulation and regulatory expectation have accelerated in established market and regulatory expectation continue to evolve in emerging market we are unable to predict whether and when any further change to law or regulatory policy affecting our business could occur such change to law or regulation governing manufacturer communication concerning drug product and drug product candidate and whether such change could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in the united state partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agency and their employee from late december through late january while federal employee have since returned to work subsequent extended shutdown could result in reduction or delay of fda activity including with respect to our ongoing clinical program our manufacturing of our product and product candidate and our product approval regulatory authority may also question the sufficiency for approval of the endpoint we select for our clinical trial number of our product and product candidate have been evaluated in clinical trial using surrogate endpoint that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical endpoint for example therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for it ability to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that patient life without the disease worsening measured by progression free survival pfs demonstrating that the product candidate produce statistically significant improvement in pfs doe not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patient remain alive in the cardiovascular setting heart disease therapeutic may be evaluated for it ability to reduce ldl level elevated ldl level ha been surrogate endpoint for cardiovascular event such death heart attack and stroke the use of surrogate endpoint such pfs and ldl reduction in the absence of other measure of clinical benefit may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such result are statistically significant regulatory authority could also add new requirement such the completion of enrollment in confirmatory study or the completion of an outcome study or meaningful portion of an outcome study condition for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication for example our initial fda application for repatha sought approval for broader patient population based on data demonstrating that repatha reduced ldl level however the fda initially approved repatha in only for subset of those patient citing among other thing the absence of positive outcome data showing that repatha prevents cardiovascular event in december the fda granted broader approval of repatha to reduce the risk of certain cardiovascular event and also to be used alone or in combination with other lipid lowering therapy for the treatment of adult with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce ldl only after our large phase outcome study evaluating the ability of repatha to prevent cardiovascular event met it primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint there may also be situation in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment option can be shown the imposition of additional requirement or our inability to meet them in timely fashion or at all may delay our clinical development and regulatory filing effort delay or prevent from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidate or new indication for existing product or prevent from maintaining our current label some of our product have been approved by and foreign regulatory authority on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirement of regulator for example in march we announced that the fda approved blincyto under accelerated approval for the treatment of adult and child with cell precursor all in first or second complete remission with minimal residual disease greater than or equal to percent continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial regulatory authority are placing greater focus on monitoring product originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsor of such product have met the condition of the accelerated or conditional approval if we are unable to fulfill the regulator requirement that were condition of product accelerated or conditional approval and or if regulator re evaluate the data or risk benefit profile of our product the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed alternatively we may be required to change the product labeled indication or even withdraw the product from the market safety problem or signal can arise our product and product candidate are evaluated in clinical trial including investigator sponsored study or our marketed product are used in clinical practice we are required to continuously collect and ass adverse event reported to and to communicate to regulatory agency these adverse event and safety signal regarding our product regulatory agency periodically perform inspection of our pharmacovigilance process including our adverse event reporting in the united state for our product with approved rem see item business government regulation post approval phase we are required to submit periodic assessment report to the fda to demonstrate that the goal of the rem are being met rem and other risk management program are designed to ensure that drug benefit outweigh the risk and vary in the element they contain if the fda is not satisfied with the result of the periodic assessment report we submit for any of our rem the fda may also modify our rem or take other regulatory action such implementing revised or restrictive labeling the drug delivery device approved for use in combination with our product are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunction if regulatory agency determine that we or other party including our clinical trial investigator those operating our patient support program or licensee of our product have not complied with the applicable reporting other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirement we may become subject to additional inspection warning letter or other enforcement action including fine marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalty our product candidate and marketed product can also be affected by safety problem or signal occurring with respect to product that are similar to or that implicate an entire class of product further result of clinical trial including sub analysis or meta analysis of earlier clinical trial meta analysis involves the use of various statistical method to combine result from previous separate but related study performed by or others concern may arise about the sufficiency of the data or study underlying product approved label such actual or perceived safety problem or concern can lead to revised or restrictive labeling for our product or the potential for restrictive labeling that may result in our decision not to commercialize product candidate requirement of risk management activity or other regulatory agency compliance action related to the promotion and sale of our product mandated post marketing commitment or pharmacovigilance program for our approved product product recall of our approved product required change to the process used in the manufacture of our product which could increase our manufacturing cost and affect the availability of contract manufacturer we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing revocation of approval for our product from the market completely or within particular therapeutic area or patient type increased timeline or delay in being approved by the fda or other regulatory body and or fewer treatment or product candidate being approved by regulatory body for example the fda is currently evaluating our bla for evenitytm for the treatment of postmenopausal woman with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture in january the fda brudac recommended that the fda approve evenitytm but also suggested that the fda require appropriate post marketing review to evaluate potential cardiovascular risk seen in one of the evenitytm pivotal clinical trial see item business significant development while the fda is not bound to follow the recommendation of it advisory committee it often doe if the fda approves evenitytm it may require that we complete post marketing study which could be time consuming and costly in addition to our innovative product we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar version of number of product currently manufactured marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical company in some market there is not yet legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars in the united state the aca provided for such pathway while the fda continues to implement it discussion continue to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific product see we currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generic in the future delay or uncertainty in the development or implementation of such pathway could result in delay or difficulty in getting our biosimilar product approved by regulatory authority subject to unanticipated development cost or otherwise reduce the value of the investment we have made in the biosimilars area further we can not predict whether any repeal or reform of the aca would affect the biosimilar pathway or have material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars in addition if we are unable to bring our biosimilar product to market on timely basis and secure first to market or other advantageous position our future biosimilar sale and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we may not be able to develop commercial product despite significant investment in amgen invests heavily in successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain and very few project produce commercial product product candidate including biosimilar product candidate or new indication for existing product collectively product candidate that appear promising in the early phase of development may fail to reach the market for number of reason such the product candidate not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial result even though it demonstrated positive preclinical trial result for reason that could include change in the standard of care of medicine the product candidate wa not effective or not more effective than currently available therapy in treating specified condition or illness the product candidate wa not cost effective in light of existing therapeutic the product candidate had harmful side effect in animal or human the necessary regulatory body such the fda or ema did not approve the product candidate for an intended use the product candidate wa not economical for to manufacture and commercialize other party had or may have had proprietary right relating to our product candidate such patent right and did not let sell it on reasonable term or at all we and certain of our licensee partner contracted organization or independent investigator may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activity the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidate wa uncertain or not well defined and the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product or wa otherwise determined by regulatory authority to not meet applicable standard for approval we have spent considerable time energy and resource developing our expertise in human genetics with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicine and help guide our research and development decision and investment we have focused our strategy on drug target validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence however candidate based on genetically validated target remain subject to the uncertainty of the drug development process and may not reach the market for number of reason including the factor listed above number of our product candidate have failed or been discontinued at various stage in the product development process for example in may we terminated our participation in the co development and commercialization of brodalumab with astrazeneca the decision wa based on event of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population inability to bring product to market or significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of new product for any of the reason discussed could potentially have negative impact on our product sale and earnings and could result in significant impairment of in process research and development ipr or other intangible asset we must conduct clinical trial in human before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication before we sell any product we must conduct clinical trial to demonstrate that our product candidate are safe and effective for use in human the result of those clinical trial are used the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authority such the fda and ema see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval we are required to conduct clinical trial using an appropriate number of trial site and patient to support the product label claim the length of time number of trial site and number of patient required for clinical trial vary substantially and we may spend several year and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trial in addition we may have difficulty finding sufficient number of clinical trial site and patient to participate in our clinical trial particularly if competitor are conducting clinical trial in similar patient population patient may withdraw from clinical trial at any time and privacy law and or other restriction in certain country may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigator to conduct further follow up on such patient which may adversely affect the interpretation of study result delay and complication in planned clinical trial can result in increased development cost associated delay in regulatory approval and in product candidate reaching the market and revision to existing product label further to increase the number of patient available for enrollment in our clinical trial we have and will continue to open clinical site and enroll patient in number of location where our experience conducting clinical trial is more limited including russia india china south korea the philippine singapore and some central and south american country either through utilization of third party contract clinical trial provider entirely or in combination with local staff conducting clinical trial in location where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resource to understand the unique regulatory environment of individual country further we must ensure the timely production distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidate to numerous and varied clinical trial site if we fail to adequately manage the design execution and diverse regulatory aspect of our large and complex clinical trial or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply corresponding regulatory approval may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidate or could lose our ability to market existing product in certain therapeutic area or altogether if we are unable to market and sell our product or product candidate or to obtain approval in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategy our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we rely on independent third party clinical investigator to recruit patient and conduct clinical trial on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocol law and regulation further we rely on unaffiliated third party vendor to perform certain aspect of our clinical trial operation in some circumstance we enter into co development arrangement with other pharmaceutical and medical device company that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trial for the product we are co developing or to develop diagnostic test used in screening patient for our clinical trial see some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sale relies on collaboration with third party which may adversely affect the development and sale of our product we also may acquire company that have past or ongoing clinical trial or right to product or product candidate for which clinical trial have been or are being conducted these trial may not have been conducted to the same standard ours however once an acquisition ha been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trial including any potential risk and liability associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trial if regulatory authority determine that we or others including our licensee or co development partner or the independent investigator or vendor selected by our co development partner or by company we have acquired or from which we have acquired right to product or product candidate have not complied with regulation applicable to the clinical trial those authority may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other action that could delay or otherwise negatively impact our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication in addition delay or failure to develop diagnostic test for our clinical trial can affect the timely enrollment of such trial and lead to delay or inability to obtain marketing approval if we were unable to market and sell our product or product candidate our business and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected in addition some of our clinical trial utilize drug manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical company these drug may be administered in clinical trial in combination with one of our product or product candidate or in head to head comparing the product or product candidate relative efficacy and safety in the event that any of these vendor or pharmaceutical company have unforeseen issue that negatively impact the quality of their work product or create shortage of supply or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drug our ability to complete our applicable clinical trial and or evaluate clinical result may also be negatively impacted result such quality or supply problem could adversely affect our ability to timely file for gain or maintain regulatory approval worldwide clinical trial must be designed based on the current standard of medical care however in certain disease such cancer the standard of care is evolving rapidly in such disease the duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trial may result in the design of such clinical trial being based on standard of medical care that are no longer the current standard by the time such trial are completed limiting the utility and application of such trial we may not obtain favorable clinical trial result and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidate or new indication for existing product and or maintain our current product label participant in clinical trial of our product and product candidate may also suffer adverse medical event or side effect that could among other factor delay or terminate clinical trial program and or require additional or longer trial to gain approval even after product is on the market safety concern may require additional or more extensive clinical trial part of risk management plan for our product or for approval of new indication for example in connection with the june esa label change we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trial examining the use of esas in ckd additional clinical trial we initiate including those required by the fda could result in substantial additional expense and the outcome could result in further label restriction or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication each of which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation additionally any negative result from such trial could materially affect the extent of approval the use reimbursement and sale of our product our business and result of operation some of our product are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic device that have their own regulatory manufacturing and other risk many of our product and product candidate may be used in combination with drug delivery device such an injector or other delivery system for example neulasta is available part of the neulasta onpro kit and our autotouch reusable auto injector is used with enbrel mini single dose prefilled cartridge in addition some of our product or product candidate may also require the use of companion diagnostic device such device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that help ensure it safe and effective use our product candidate or expanded indication of our product used with such device may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development of such device is delayed such device do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance or if such device do not remain commercially available when approval of the product and device is sought under single marketing drug application the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval in addition some of these device may be provided by single source unaffiliated third party company we are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third party company both to supply the device and in some case to conduct the study required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agency we are also dependent on those third party company continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirement failure to successfully develop modify or supply the device delay in or failure of the amgen or third party study or failure of or the third party company to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the device could result in increased development cost delay in or failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approval and or associated delay in product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indication for existing product we are also required to collect and ass user complaint adverse event and malfunction regarding our device and actual or perceived safety problem or concern with device used with our product can lead to regulatory action and impact to our product see our current product and product in development can not be sold without regulatory approval additionally regulatory agency conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspection to identify and evaluate potential issue with our device for example in the fda reported on it adverse event reporting system that it is evaluating our neulasta onpro kit loss of regulatory approval or clearance of device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market further failure to successfully develop supply or gain or maintain approval for these device could adversely affect sale of the related approved product some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sale relies on collaboration with third party which may adversely affect the development and sale of our product we depend on alliance with other company including pharmaceutical and biotechnology company vendor and service provider for the development of portion of the product in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sale of certain of our commercial product for example we have collaboration with third party under which we share development right obligation and cost and or commercial right and obligation see item business business relationship failure by these party to meet their contractual regulatory or other obligation to or any disruption in the relationship between and these third party could have material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business in addition our collaborative relationship for research and development and or commercialization and sale often extend for many year and give rise to dispute regarding the relative right obligation and revenue of and our collaboration partner including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated right and obligation this could result in the loss of intellectual property right or protection delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical product impact the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized product and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation administrative proceeding or arbitration the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability we are subject to income and other tax in the united state and other jurisdiction in which we do business result our provision for income tax is derived from combination of applicable tax rate in the various place we operate significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax our tax return are routinely examined by tax authority in the united state and other jurisdiction in which we do business and number of audit are currently underway tax authority including the internal revenue service irs are becoming more aggressive in their audit and are particularly focused on the allocation of income and expense among tax jurisdiction previously disclosed we received revenue agent report rar from the irs for the year and the rar proposes to make significant adjustment that relate primarily to the allocation of profit between certain of our entity in the united state and the territory of puerto rico in november we received modified rar that revised the irs calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustment we disagree with the proposed adjustment and are pursuing resolution with the irs administrative appeal office which currently ha jurisdiction over the matter if we deem necessary we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustment through the judicial process although final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next month such resolution could have material negative impact on our consolidated financial statement we believe our accrual for income tax liability is appropriate based on past experience interpretation of tax law and judgment about potential action by tax authority however due to the complexity of the provision for income tax the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payment greater or le than amount accrued our provision for income tax and result of operation in the future could be adversely affected by change to our operating structure change in the mix of income and expense in country with differing tax rate change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability and change in applicable tax law regulation or administrative interpretation thereof the tax act is complex and further regulation and interpretation are still being issued we could face audit challenge on how we apply the new law that could have negative impact on our provision for income tax change to the tax system such repeal or modification of the tax act change to the tax system in jurisdiction where we have significant operation such the territory of puerto rico or change in tax law in the united state or other jurisdiction where we do business could have material and adverse effect on our business and on the result of our operation we perform substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activity at our facility in the territory of puerto rico and substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activity at our facility in thousand oak california significant disruption or production failure at these facility could significantly impair our ability to supply our product or continue our clinical trial the global supply of our product and product candidate for commercial sale and for use in our clinical trial is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facility in particular those in the territory of puerto rico and thousand oak california see manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale we currently perform substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activity at our facility in thousand oak california substantial disruption in our ability to operate our thousand oak california manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidate for use in our clinical trial leading to delay in development of our product candidate in addition we currently perform substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activity at our facility in the territory of puerto rico in late september hurricane maria made landfall on the island of puerto rico the hurricane destroyed residential and commercial building agriculture communication network and most of puerto rico electric grid while the critical manufacturing area of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly impacted by the storm the restoration of electrical service on the island wa slow process and our facility operated with electrical power from back up diesel powered generator for some time in january we reconnected to the puerto rico electric grid but have continued to use diesel generator needed when sufficient electric power ha not been reliably available further instability of the electric grid could require to increase the use of our generator or even return to using them exclusively in addition future storm or other disaster or event could cause more significant impact to our manufacturing operation substantial disruption in our ability to operate our puerto rico manufacturing facility whether due to problem with the facility the infrastructure and service available on the island the unavailability of raw material or supply from vendor the unavailability of key staff or otherwise or get supply and manufactured product transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect ability to supply our product and affect our product sale see manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale the impact of hurricane maria placed greater stress on the island already challenged economy prior to hurricane maria the government of puerto rico wa unable to pay it roughly billion in debt in june the congress passed the puerto rico oversight management and economic stability act promesa which established financial oversight and management board oversight board to provide fiscal oversight through the development and approval of fiscal plan and budget for puerto rico and to assist in it debt restructuring in may after negotiation for debt restructuring with creditor were unsuccessful the oversight board approved and certified the filing in the district court for the district of puerto rico of voluntary petition under title iii of promesa for the government of puerto rico and certain of it governmental entity including the puerto rico electric power authority prepa title iii of promesa provides puerto rico with judicial process for restructuring it debt similar to but not identical to chapter of the bankruptcy code the governor of puerto rico declared state of emergency and authorized moratorium on the payment of general obligation bond and other debt issued by certain instrumentality which moratorium ha been extended and may continue to be extended while the oversight board is in effect given the severe condition in puerto rico after hurricane maria resolution of puerto rico debt situation through the promesa judicial process ha been delayed in the case of prepa the effect of hurricane maria and several change in prepa management have delayed reconstruction effort in june the oversight board certified budget for puerto rico fiscal year that imposes significant expense reduction across the government the title iii court upheld government challenge to the budget and the governor and legislature of puerto rico have now filed appeal before the court of appeal for the first circuit in addition certain non governmental entity have brought suit claiming the appointment process of the oversight board member set forth in promesa conflict with the appointment clause of the constitution if the first circuit were to hold that promesa ha constitutional infirmity and that action taken by the oversight board are invalid the commencement of all title iii proceeding could be invalid in such event the current debt restructuring process and the debtholder litigation stay under title iii of promesa could be in jeopardy in october the fiscal plan for puerto rico wa updated including projected increase in federal disaster funding and projected material deficit once the stimulus effect of the disaster recovery dissipate the fiscal plan stress the importance of structural reform to address puerto rico challenging economic and demographic trend that may be difficult to implement well have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement in addition the tax act will no longer permit deferral of taxation on puerto rico earnings of company or their foreign subsidiary although these earnings generally will be taxed in the united state at reduced rate given puerto rico challenged economy and hurricane recovery need it may be difficult for puerto rico to sustain or grow it manufacturing base due to competition from other foreign location subject to similar level of taxation or location due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from to the manufacturing sector contributes more than of puerto rico gross domestic product and multinational company with puerto rico operation contribute approximately of puerto rico revenue base while promesa and the action above continue to be important factor in moving puerto rico toward economic stability there is still risk that puerto rico ongoing economic challenge the effect of hurricane maria and the potential impact of the tax act could negatively affect the territorial government provision of utility or other service in puerto rico that we use in the operation of our business create the potential for increased tax or fee to operate in puerto rico result in migration of worker from puerto rico to the mainland united state or make it more expensive or difficult for to operate in puerto rico which could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product and affect our product sale we rely on third party supplier for certain of our raw material medical device and component we rely on unaffiliated third party supplier for certain raw material medical device and component necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical product certain of those raw material medical device and component are proprietary product of those unaffiliated third party supplier and are specifically cited in our drug application with regulatory agency so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or source and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier for example insulet corporation is our single source of the on body injector for our neulasta onpro kit also certain of the raw material required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our product are sourced from other country and or derived from biological source including mammalian tissue bovine serum and human serum albumin among the reason we may be unable to obtain these raw material medical device and component include regulatory requirement or action by regulatory agency or others adverse financial or other strategic development at or affecting the supplier including bankruptcy unexpected demand for or shortage of raw material medical device or component failure to comply with our quality standard which result in quality and product failure product contamination and or recall material shortage contamination recall and or restriction on the use of certain biologically derived substance or other raw material discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfection in raw material medical device or component and labor dispute or shortage including from the effect of health emergency and natural disaster for example in prior year we have experienced shortage in certain component necessary for the formulation fill and finish of certain of our product in our puerto rico facility further quality issue that result in unexpected additional demand for certain component may lead to shortage of required raw material or component such we have experienced with epogen glass vial we may experience similar or other shortage in the future resulting in delayed shipment supply constraint clinical trial delay contract dispute and or stock out of our product these or other similar event could negatively impact our ability to satisfy demand for our product or conduct clinical trial which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation manufacturing difficulty disruption or delay could limit supply of our product and limit our product sale manufacturing biologic human therapeutic product is difficult complex and highly regulated we currently are involved in the manufacture of many of our product and plan to manufacture many of our product candidate in addition we currently use third party contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our product and we currently use contract manufacturer to produce or assist in the production of number of our late stage product candidate and drug delivery device see item business manufacturing distribution and raw material manufacturing our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our product and product candidate to support our clinical trial is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facility and those of our third party contract manufacturer which may be impacted by capacity of manufacturing facility contamination by microorganism or virus or foreign particle from the manufacturing process natural or other disaster including hurricane earthquake volcano or fire labor dispute or shortage including the effect of health emergency or natural disaster compliance with regulatory requirement change in forecast of future demand timing and actual number of production run and production success rate and yield update of manufacturing specification contractual dispute with our supplier and contract manufacturer timing and outcome of product quality testing power failure and or other utility failure breakdown failure substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment and or delay in the ability of the fda or foreign regulatory agency to provide necessary review inspection and approval including result of subsequent extended federal government shutdown if any of these or other problem affect production in one or more of our facility or those of our third party contract manufacturer or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our product or the amount of our product candidate required in clinical trial we may be unable to increase production in our unaffected facility to meet demand if the efficient manufacture and supply of our product or product candidate is interrupted we may experience delayed shipment delay in our clinical trial supply constraint stock out adverse event trend contract dispute and or recall of our product from time to time we have initiated recall of certain lot of our product for example in july we initiated voluntary recall of an aranesp lot distributed in the eu after particle were detected in quality control sample following distribution of that lot and in april we initiated precautionary recall of two batch of vectibix distributed in switzerland after potential crimping defect were discovered in the metal seal on the product vial if we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our product to patient may lose patient and physician may elect to prescribe competing therapeutic instead of our product which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation our manufacturing process those of our third party contract manufacturer and those of certain of our third party service provider must undergo regulatory approval process and are subject to continued review by the fda and other regulatory authority it can take longer than five year to build validate and license another manufacturing plant and it can take longer than three year to qualify and license new contract manufacturer or service provider if we elect or are required to make change to our manufacturing process because of new regulatory requirement new interpretation of existing requirement or other reason this could increase our manufacturing cost and result in delayed shipment delay in our clinical trial supply constraint stock out adverse event trend or contract negotiation or dispute such manufacturing challenge may also occur if our existing contract manufacturer are unable or unwilling to implement such change if regulatory authority determine that we or our third party contract manufacturer or certain of our third party service provider have violated regulation or if authority restrict suspend or revoke our prior approval they could prohibit from manufacturing our product or conducting clinical trial or selling our marketed product until we or the affected third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider comply or indefinitely such issue may also delay the approval of product candidate we have submitted for regulatory review even if such product candidate are not directly related to the product device or process at issue with regulator because our third party contract manufacturer and certain of our third party service provider are subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority alternative qualified third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider may not be available on timely basis or at all if we or our third party contract manufacturer or third party service provider cease or interrupt production or if our third party contract manufacturer and third party service provider fail to supply material product or service to we may experience delayed shipment delay in our clinical trial supply constraint contract dispute stock out and or recall of our product additionally we distribute substantial volume of our commercial product through our primary distribution center in louisville kentucky for the united state and in breda netherlands for europe and much of the rest of the world we also conduct all the labeling and packaging of our product distributed in europe and much of the rest of the world in breda our ability to timely supply product is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our distribution and logistics center our third party logistics provider and our labeling and packaging facility in breda further we rely on commercial transportation including air and sea freight for the distribution of our product to our customer which may be negatively impacted by natural disaster or security threat concentration of sale at certain of our wholesaler distributor and at one free standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payer may negatively impact our business certain of our distributor customer and payer have substantial purchasing leverage due to the volume of our product they purchase or the number of patient life for which they provide coverage the substantial majority of our product sale is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributor amerisourcebergen corporation mckesson corporation and cardinal health inc these distributor in turn sell our product to their customer which include physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy one of our product epogen is sold primarily to free standing dialysis clinic davita owns or manages large number of the outpatient dialysis facility located in the united state and account for approximately of all epogen sale similarly discussed above there ha been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry including that small number of pbms now oversee substantial percentage of total covered life in the united state see our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability the three largest pbms in the united state are now part of major health insurance provider the growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entity may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discount on our product fee for other service or rebate negatively impacting our bargaining position sale and or profit margin in addition decision by these entity to purchase or cover le or none of our product in favor of competitive product could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation due to their purchasing volume further if one of our significant wholesale distributor encounter financial or other difficulty and becomes unable or unwilling to pay all amount that such distributor owes on timely basis or at all it could negatively impact our business and result of operation in addition if one of our significant wholesale distributor becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue it commercial relationship with in it present form it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sale our business and result of operation unless suitable alternative are timely found or lost sale are absorbed by another distributor our effort to acquire other company or product and to integrate their operation may not be successful and may result in unanticipated cost delay or failure to realize the benefit of the transaction we seek innovation through significant investment in both internal and external transaction including collaboration partnering alliance license joint venture merger and acquisition acquisition activity we have an ongoing process of evaluating such potential acquisition activity opportunity that we expect will contribute to our future growth and expand our geographic footprint product offering and or our pipeline acquisition or similar arrangement may be complex time and expensive and may result in unanticipated cost delay or other operational or financial problem related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company which may result in the diversion of our management attention from other business issue and opportunity we may pay substantial amount of cash incur debt or issue equity security to pay for acquisition activity which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholder respectively failure or difficulty in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operation of the business we acquire including their technology compliance program distribution and general business operation and procedure while preserving important distribution marketing promotion and other relationship may affect our ability to grow and may result in our incurring asset impairment or restructuring charge our sale and operation are subject to the risk of business internationally including in emerging market we continue our expansion effort in emerging market around the world through acquisition and licensing transaction well through the development and introduction of our product in new market we face numerous risk to our business there is no guarantee that our effort and strategy to expand sale in emerging market will succeed emerging market country may be especially vulnerable to period of global and local political legal regulatory and financial instability including sovereign debt issue and or the imposition of international sanction in response to certain state action we may also be required to increase our reliance on third party agent and unfamiliar operation and arrangement previously utilized by company we partner with or acquire in emerging market see we must conduct clinical trial in human before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidate or existing product for new indication we expand internationally we are subject to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar while we have program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation through foreign currency hedging arrangement our hedging effort do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuation on our revenue and earnings our international operation and business may also be subject to le protective intellectual property or other applicable law diverse data privacy and protection requirement changing tax law and tariff trade restriction or other barrier designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition far reaching anti bribery and anti corruption law and regulation and or evolving legal and regulatory environment these legal and operational challenge along with government control the challenge of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approval of our product may result in material adverse impact on our international product sale business and result of operation our business may be affected by litigation and government investigation we and certain of our subsidiary are involved in legal proceeding see part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable and the outcome can result in costly verdict fine and penalty exclusion from federal healthcare program and or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business defense of litigation claim can be expensive time consuming and distracting and it is possible that we could incur judgment or enter into settlement of claim for monetary damage or change the way we operate our business which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation in addition product liability is major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical product we may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trial and for product we sell after regulatory approval product liability claim regardless of their merit could be costly and divert management attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our product we and certain of our subsidiary have previously been named defendant in product liability action for certain of our product we are also involved in government investigation that arise in the ordinary course of our business in recent year there ha been trend of increasing government investigation and litigation against company operating in our industry both in the united state and around the world our business activity outside of the united state are subject to the fcpa and similar anti bribery or anti corruption law regulation or rule of other country in which we operate including the uk bribery act we can not ensure that all our employee agent contractor vendor licensee partner or collaborator will comply with all applicable law and regulation in we finalized settlement agreement with the government and various other party to settle certain allegation regarding our sale and marketing practice and agreed to operate under corporate integrity agreement with the oig of the department of health and human service which wa formally closed out in august we may see new government investigation of or action against citing novel theory of recovery any of these result could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation breakdown cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our information technology system and network connected control system and our data interrupt the operation of our business and affect our reputation to achieve our business objective we rely to large extent upon sophisticated information technology system and network connected control system some of which are managed hosted provided or serviced by third party internal or external event that compromise the confidentiality integrity and availability of our system and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business result in significant cost and or affect our reputation information technology system are highly integrated into our business including our effort our clinical and commercial manufacturing process and our product sale and distribution process the complexity and interconnected nature of our system make them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruption our system are also subject to frequent cyberattacks the cyber threat landscape evolves these attack are growing in frequency sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect such attack could include the use of key logger or other harmful and virulent malware including ransomware or other denial of service and can be deployed through malicious website the use of social engineering and or other mean attack such those seen with other multi national company including some of our peer could leave unable to utilize key business system or access important data needed to operate our business including developing gaining regulatory approval for manufacturing selling and distributing our product for example in pharmaceutical company experienced cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted it operation including it research and sale operation and the production of some of it medicine and vaccine result of the cyberattack it order and sale for certain product in certain market were negatively impacted our system also contain and utilize high volume of sensitive data including intellectual property trade secret financial information regulatory information strategic plan sale trend and forecast litigation material or personal information belonging to our staff our patient customer and or other business partner in some case we utilize third party service provider to process store manage or transmit such data which may increase our risk intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breach including cyberattacks by employee service provider nation state organized crime organization hacktivists or others pose risk that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized person our competitor or the public finally domestic and global government regulator our key business partner supplier with whom we do business company that provide or our partner with important business service and company we may acquire may face similar risk and security breach of their system could adversely affect our security leave without access to important system product raw material component service or information or expose our confidential data for example we distribute our product in the united state primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesaler and security breach that impairs the distribution operation of our wholesaler could significantly impair our ability to deliver our product to healthcare provider although in the past we have experienced system breakdown attack and information security breach we do not believe such breakdown attack and breach have had material adverse effect on our business or result of operation we continue to invest in the monitoring protection and resilience of our critical or sensitive data and system however there can be no assurance that our effort will detect prevent or fully recover system or data from all breakdown service interruption attack or breach of our system that could adversely affect our business and operation and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive data which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to or impact our stock price while we maintain cyber liability insurance our insurance is not sufficient to cover against all loss that could potentially result from service interruption breach of our system or loss of our critical or sensitive data global economic condition may negatively affect and may magnify certain risk that affect our business our operation and performance have been and may continue to be affected by global economic condition financial pressure may cause government or other third party payer to more aggressively seek cost containment measure see our sale depend on coverage and reimbursement from third party payer and pricing and reimbursement pressure may affect our profitability result of global economic condition some third party payer may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligation job loss or other economic hardship may also affect patient ability to afford health care result of increased co pay or deductible obligation greater cost sensitivity to existing co pay or deductible obligation lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reason we believe such condition have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation economic condition may also adversely affect the ability of our distributor customer and supplier to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw material and to perform their obligation under agreement with which could disrupt our operation although we monitor our distributor customer and supplier financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risk some of our distributor customer and supplier may become insolvent which could have material adverse effect on our product sale business and result of operation we maintain significant portfolio of investment disclosed cash equivalent and marketable security on our consolidated balance sheet the value of our investment may be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuation downgrade in credit rating illiquidity in the capital market and other factor that may result in other than temporary decline in the value of our investment any of those event could cause to record impairment charge with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize loss on sale of investment our stock price is volatile our stock price like that of our peer in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is volatile our revenue and operating result may fluctuate from period to period for number of reason event such delay in product development change to our expectation or strategy or even relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial result for period to be our expectation or projection result our revenue and operating result and in turn our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuation announcement or discussion including via social medium channel of possible restrictive action by government or private payer that would impact our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate whether or not such restrictive action ever actually occur similarly actual or perceived safety issue with our product or similar product or unexpected clinical trial result can have an immediate and rapid impact on our stock price whether or not our operating result are materially impacted we may not be able to access the capital and credit market on term that are favorable to or at all the capital and credit market may experience extreme volatility and disruption which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issue for both borrower and investor we expect to access the capital market to supplement our existing fund and cash generated from operation in satisfying our need for working capital capital expenditure and debt service requirement our plan to pay dividend and repurchase stock and other business initiative we plan to strategically pursue including acquisition and licensing activity in the event of adverse capital and credit market condition we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation change in credit rating issued by nationally recognized credit rating agency could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on

credit and federal tax benefit of state tax and related accrued interest and penalty of billion of december are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is high degree of

consolidated balance sheet of december the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreement we have entered into with third party is billion including million of contingent consideration payment in connection with the acquisition of biovex contingent consideration with respect to the acquisition of dezima pharma wa excluded due to the discontinuation of the development of amg upon which payment are based see part iv note fair value measurement to the consolidated financial statement of critical accounting policiesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the financial statement and the note to the financial statement some of those judgment can be subjective and complex and therefore actual result could differ materially from those estimate under different assumption or condition product sale and sale deductionsrevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of product to customer generally upon delivery based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled net of accrual for estimated rebate wholesaler chargebacks discount and other deduction collectively sale deduction and return established at the time of sale we analyze the adequacy of our accrual for sale deduction quarterly amount accrued for sale deduction are adjusted when trend or significant event indicate that adjustment is appropriate accrual are also adjusted to reflect actual result amount recorded in accrued liability in the consolidated balance sheet for sale deduction were follows in million rebate chargebacks other deduction totalbalance of december charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december charged against product balance of december the year ended december and total sale deduction were and of gross product sale respectively the increase in the total sale deduction balance of december compared to december wa driven primarily by the impact of higher sale increase in rebate and chargebacks well timing of payment included in the amount are immaterial net adjustment related to prior year sale due to change in estimate such amount represent le than of the aggregate sale deduction charged against product sale in the year ended december and in the united state we utilize wholesaler the principal mean of distributing our product to healthcare provider such physician or their clinic dialysis center hospital and pharmacy product we sell in europe are distributed principally to hospital and or wholesaler depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product are sold we monitor the inventory level of our product at our wholesaler by using data from our wholesaler and other third party and we believe wholesaler inventory have been maintained at appropriate level generally two to three week given end user demand accordingly historical fluctuation in wholesaler inventory level have not significantly affected our method of estimating sale deduction and return accrual for sale deduction are based primarily on estimate of the amount earned or to be claimed on the related sale these estimate take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirement specific known market event and trend internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying pattern sale deduction are substantially product specific and therefore for any given year can be affected by the mix of product sold rebate include primarily amount paid to payer and provider in the united state including those paid to state medicaid program and are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which vary by product by payer and by individual payer plan we sell product we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold contractual term estimated patient population historical experience and wholesaler inventory level and we accrue these rebate in the period the related sale are recorded we then adjust the rebate accrual more information becomes available and to reflect actual claim experience estimating such rebate is complicated in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebate is reasonable and appropriate given current fact and circumstance but actual result may differ chargebacks relate to our contractual agreement to sell product to healthcare provider in the united state at fixed price that are lower than the price we charge wholesaler when healthcare provider purchase our product through wholesaler at these reduced price wholesaler charge for the difference between their purchase price and the contractual price between amgen and the healthcare provider the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sale by our wholesaler customer to healthcare provider accrual for wholesaler chargebacks are le difficult to estimate than rebate are and they closely approximate actual result since chargeback amount are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider and because we generally settle the liability for these deduction within few week product returnsreturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sale on production lot basis historical rate of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected change in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate in each of the past three year sale return provision have amounted to le than of gross product sale change in estimate for prior year sale return provision have historically been immaterial income taxeswe provide for income tax based on pretax income and applicable tax rate in the various jurisdiction in which we operate we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statement for particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized the amount of utbs is adjusted appropriate for change in fact and circumstance such significant amendment to existing tax law new regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information obtained during tax examination or resolution of an examination we believe our estimate for uncertain tax position are appropriate and sufficient for any assessment that may result from examination of our tax return we recognize both accrued interest and penalty where appropriate related to utbs in income tax expense certain item are included in our tax return at different time than they are reflected in the financial statement and cause temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount such temporary difference create deferred tax asset and liability deferred tax asset are generally item that can be used tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future year but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statement we establish valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit deferred tax liability are either tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement for which payment ha been deferred ii expense for which we have already taken deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized the expense in the consolidated financial statement or iii liability for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible asset acquired in many business combination future expense associated with these asset most often will not be tax deductible we are vertically integrated enterprise with operation in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction we are subject to income tax in the foreign jurisdiction where we conduct activity based on the tax law and principle of such jurisdiction and the function risk and activity performed therein our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign source based on the operation performed and risk assumed in each location and the tax law and principle of the respective taxing jurisdiction for example we conduct significant operation in puerto rico territory of the united state that is treated foreign jurisdiction for tax purpose pertaining to manufacturing distribution and other related function to meet our worldwide product demand income from our operation in puerto rico is subject to tax incentive grant through on december the united state enacted the tax act which imposes repatriation tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiary imposes current tax on certain foreign earnings and lower the general corporate income tax rate to in december the sec staff issued sab which allows to record provisional amount during measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date we have completed our accounting for the tax effect of the tax act including the repatriation tax the net deferred tax remeasurement and the impact on our unrealized tax benefit none of the adjustment we made to our provisional amount were material to our consolidated financial statement previously disclosed we received rar from the irs for the year and the rar proposes to make significant adjustment that relate primarily to the allocation of profit between certain of our entity in the united state and the territory of puerto rico in november we received modified rar that revised the irs calculation but continued to propose substantial adjustment we disagree with the proposed adjustment and are pursuing resolution with the irs administrative appeal office which currently ha jurisdiction over the matter if we deem necessary we will vigorously contest the proposed adjustment through the judicial process final resolution of this complex matter is not likely within the next month and could have material impact on our consolidated financial statement we believe our accrual for income tax liability is appropriate based on past experience interpretation of tax law and judgment about potential action by tax authority however due to the of the provision for income tax the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may result in payment greater or le than amount accrued see part iv note income tax to the consolidated financial statement our operation are subject to the tax law regulation and administrative practice of the united state state jurisdiction and other country including the territory of puerto rico in which we do business significant change in these rule could have material adverse effect on our result of operation see part item risk factor the adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liability could affect our profitability contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceeding government investigation and other matter such intellectual property dispute contractual dispute and class action suit which are complex in nature and have outcome that are difficult to predict we describe our legal proceeding and other matter that are significant or that we believe could become significant in part iv note contingency and commitment to the consolidated financial statement we record accrual for loss contingency to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated we evaluate on quarterly basis development in legal proceeding and other matter that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that ha been accrued previously while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these item an adverse determination in one or more of these item currently pending could have material adverse effect on our consolidated result of operation financial position or cash flow valuation of asset and liability in connection with business combinationswe have acquired and continue to acquire intangible asset in connection with business combination these intangible asset consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic product and ipr product candidate discounted cash flow model are typically used to determine the fair value of these intangible asset for purpose of allocating consideration paid to the net asset acquired in business combination see part iv note business combination to the consolidated financial statement these model require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to determining the timing and expected cost to complete in process project taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agency for product candidate estimating the timing of and future net cash flow from product sale resulting from completed product and in process project and developing appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flow significant estimate and assumption are also required to determine the acquisition date fair value of any contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination in addition we must revalue these obligation each subsequent reporting period until the related contingency are resolved and record change in their fair value in earnings the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration obligation incurred or assumed in the acquisition of business were determined using combination of valuation technique significant estimate and assumption required for these valuation included but were not limited to the probability of achieving regulatory milestone product sale projection under various scenario and discount rate used to calculate the present value of the required payment these estimate and assumption are required to be updated in order to revalue these contingent consideration obligation each reporting period accordingly subsequent change in underlying fact and circumstance could result in change in these estimate and assumption which could have material impact on the estimated future fair value of these obligation we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired and contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination are based on reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date impairment of long lived assetswe review the carrying value of our property plant and equipment and our finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable if such circumstance exist an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow to be generated by the long lived asset is compared to the value to determine whether an impairment exists if an asset is determined to be impaired the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset fair value and it carrying value indefinite lived intangible asset composed of ipr project acquired in business combination that have not reached technological feasibility or that lack regulatory approval at the time of acquisition are reviewed for impairment annually whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and upon establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval we determine impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the asset carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recorded for the difference and it carrying value is reduced accordingly estimating future cash flow of an ipr product candidate for purpose of an impairment analysis requires to make significant estimate and assumption regarding the amount and timing of cost to complete the project and the amount timing and probability of achieving revenue from the completed product similar to how the acquisition date fair value of the project wa determined described above there are often major risk and uncertainty associated with ipr project we are required to obtain regulatory approval in order to be able to market these product such approval require completing clinical trial that demonstrate product candidate is safe and effective consequently the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr project may vary from it fair value at the date of acquisition and ipr impairment charge may occur in future period which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation we believe our estimation of future cash flow used for assessing impairment of long lived asset are based on reasonable assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related date of the assessment recently issued accounting standardssee part iv note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement for discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncement and recently issued accounting pronouncement not yet adopted of december item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk that may result from change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and price of equity instrument well change in general economic condition in the country where we conduct business to reduce certain of these risk we enter into various type of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transaction part of our risk management program we do not use derivative for speculative trading purpose in the discussion that follows we have assumed hypothetical change in interest rate of basis point from those of december and we have also assumed hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate against the dollar based on it position relative to other currency of december and interest rate sensitive financial instrumentsour portfolio of available for sale interest bearing security of december and wa composed of treasury security and other government related debt security corporate debt security residential mortgage backed and other mortgage and asset backed security money market mutual fund and other short term interest bearing security composed principally of commercial paper the fair value of our investment portfolio of interest bearing security were billion and billion of december and respectively duration is sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of security that will result from basis point change in interest rate applying duration model hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate of december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these security of million and billion respectively on these date in addition hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate of december and would not result in material effect on income in the respective ensuing year of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion of december we had outstanding debt with carrying value of billion and fair value of billion our outstanding debt wa composed primarily of debt with fixed interest rate with variable rate debt having carrying value of million of december and change in interest rate do not affect interest expense on fixed rate debt change in interest rate would however affect the fair value of fixed rate debt hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rate relative to interest rate of december and would have resulted in increase of billion and billion respectively in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these date analysis of the debt doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related interest rate swap contract and cross currency swap contract discussed below achieve desired mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt we entered into interest rate swap contract that qualified and were designated for accounting purpose fair value hedge for certain of our fixed rate debt these interest rate swap contract effectively converted fixed rate interest coupon to floating rate libor based coupon over the life of the respective note interest rate swap contract with aggregate notional amount of billion and billion were outstanding of december and respectively hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate relative to interest rate of december and would have resulted in reduction in fair value of million and million respectively on our interest rate swap contract on these date and would not result in material effect on the related income in the respective ensuing year analysis of the interest rate swap contract doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in interest rate would have on the related fair value of debt that these interest rate sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had outstanding cross currency swap contract with aggregate notional amount of billion that hedge certain of our foreign currency denominated debt and related interest payment these contract effectively convert interest payment and principal repayment of this debt to dollar from euro pound sterling and swiss franc and are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge hypothetical basis point adverse movement in interest rate relative to interest rate of december and would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of our cross currency swap contract of million and million respectively foreign currency sensitive financial instrumentsour international operation are affected by fluctuation in the value of the dollar compared to foreign currency predominantly the euro increase and decrease in our international product sale from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our international operating expense increase and decrease in our foreign currency denominated asset from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are offset partially by the corresponding increase or decrease in our foreign currency denominated liability to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on our result of operation we enter into foreign currency forward option and cross currency swap contract of december we had outstanding euro pound sterling and swiss franc denominated debt with principal carrying value and fair value of billion and billion respectively of december we had outstanding euro pound sterling and swiss franc denominated debt with principal carrying value and fair value of billion and billion respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate of december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of billion on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of billion hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate of december would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of billion on this date and reduction in income in the ensuing year of billion the impact on income from these hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would be substantially offset by the impact such change would have on related cross currency swap contract which are in place for the related foreign currency denominated debt we have cross currency swap contract that are designated cash flow hedge of certain of our debt denominated in euro pound sterling and swiss franc with an aggregate notional amount of billion of december and hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would have resulted in reduction in the fair value of these contract of billion and billion on these date respectively the impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate on ensuing year income from these contract would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical change in the carrying amount of the related hedged debt we enter into foreign currency forward and option contract that are designated for accounting purpose cash flow hedge of certain anticipated foreign currency transaction of december we had open foreign currency forward and option contract primarily euro based with notional amount of billion and million respectively of december we had open foreign currency forward and option contract primarily euro based with notional amount of billion and million respectively of december the fair value of these contract were million asset and million liability of december the fair value of these contract were million asset and million liability with regard to foreign currency forward and option contract that were open of december hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate of december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of million on this date and in the ensuing year reduction in income of million with regard to contract that were open of december hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate of december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of million on this date and in the ensuing year reduction in income of million the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on anticipated transaction that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset of december and we had open foreign currency forward contract with notional amount of million and million respectively that hedged fluctuation of certain asset and liability denominated in foreign currency but were not designated hedge for accounting purpose these contract had no material net unrealized gain or loss of december and with regard to these foreign currency forward contract that were open of december and hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate on these date would not have material effect on the fair value of these contract or related income in the respective ensuing year the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on asset and liability that these foreign currency sensitive instrument were designed to offset market price sensitive financial instrumentsas of december and we were also exposed to price risk on equity security included in our portfolio of investment which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objective these investment are generally in small capitalization stock in the biotechnology industry sector price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio of december and wa not material counterparty credit risksour financial instrument including derivative are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider part of the overall fair value measurement our financial risk management policy limit derivative transaction by requiring transaction to be with institution with minimum credit rating of or equivalent by moody or fitch and requires placing exposure limit on the amount with any individual counterparty in addition we have an investment policy that limit investment to certain type of debt and money market instrument issued by institution

preparation of consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note actual result may differ from those estimate revenuesadoption of new revenue recognition standardin may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new accounting standard that amends the guidance for the recognition of revenue from contract with customer to transfer good and service the fasb subsequently issued additional clarifying standard to address issue arising from implementation of the new revenue recognition standard the new revenue recognition standard and clarifying standard require an entity to recognize revenue when control of promised good or service is transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service we adopted this new standard of january by applying the modified retrospective method to those contract that were not completed of that date the result for reporting period beginning after january are presented in accordance with the new standard although comparative information ha not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standard and policy in effect for those period upon adoption we recorded net decrease of million to accumulated deficit due to the cumulative impact of adopting the new standard with the impact related primarily to the acceleration of deferred revenue net of related deferred tax impact the adoption of this new standard had an immaterial impact on our reported total revenue and operating income compared to what reported amount would have been under the prior standard and we expect the impact of adoption in future period to also be immaterial our accounting policy under the new standard were applied prospectively and are described below see note revenue product sale and sale deductionsrevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of product to customer generally upon delivery based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled net of accrual for estimated rebate wholesaler chargebacks discount and other deduction collectively sale deduction and return established at the time of sale we analyze the adequacy of our accrual for sale deduction quarterly amount accrued for sale deduction are adjusted when trend or significant event indicate that an adjustment is appropriate accrual are also adjusted to reflect actual result accrual for sale deduction are based primarily on estimate of the amount earned or to be claimed on the related sale these estimate take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirement specific known market event and trend internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying pattern sale deduction are substantially product specific and therefore for any given period can be affected by the mix of product sold included in sale deduction are immaterial net adjustment related to prior period sale due to change in estimate historically such amount have represented le than of the aggregate sale deduction charged against product sale are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sale on production lot basis historical rate of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected change in the marketplace specific to each product when appropriate historically sale return provision have amounted to le than of gross product sale change in estimate for prior period sale return provision have historically been immaterial our payment term vary by type and location of customer and the product or service offered payment term differ by jurisdiction and customer but payment is generally required in term ranging from to day from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation for certain product or service and certain customer type we may require payment before product are delivered or service are rendered to customer indirect tax collected from customer and remitted to government authority and that are related to sale of the company product primarily in europe are excluded from revenue practical expedient

amgen in the form of nonrefundable upfront license fee development and commercial performance milestone payment royalty payment and or profit sharing in arrangement involving more than one performance obligation each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies distinct performance obligation based on whether the customer can benefit from the good or service either on it own or together with other resource that are readily available and ii the good or service is separately identifiable from other promise in the contract the consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on it respective relative stand alone selling price the estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable wa regularly sold by on stand alone basis or using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on stand alone basis is not available the consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized revenue when control of the related good or service is transferred consideration associated with at risk substantive performance milestone is recognized revenue when it is probable that significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we utilize the sale and usage based royalty exception in arrangement that resulted from the license of intellectual property recognizing revenue generated from royalty or profit sharing the underlying sale occur research and development costsr cost are expensed incurred and include primarily salary benefit and other staff related cost facility and overhead cost clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing cost contract service and other outside

stock based compensation income taxeswe provide for income tax based on pretax income and applicable tax rate in the various jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax and income tax asset and liability including evaluating uncertainty in the application of accounting principle and complex tax law deferred income tax are recorded for the expected tax consequence of temporary difference between the base of asset and liability well for loss and tax credit carryforwards for financial reporting purpose and amount recognized for income tax purpose we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statement for particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized the amount of unrecognized tax benefit utbs is adjusted appropriate for change in fact and circumstance such significant amendment to existing tax law new regulation or interpretation by the taxing authority new information

combinationsbusiness combination are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting under the acquisition method asset acquired including in process research and development ipr project and liability assumed are recorded at their respective fair value of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statement the excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net asset acquired is recorded goodwill contingent consideration obligation incurred in connection with business combination including the assumption of an acquiree liability arising from business combination it consummated prior to our acquisition are recorded at their fair value on the acquisition date and remeasured at their fair value each subsequent reporting period until the related contingency are resolved the resulting change in fair value are recorded in earnings see note business combination and note fair value measurement cash equivalentswe consider cash equivalent to be only those investment that are highly liquid readily convertible to cash and which mature within three month from the date of purchase interest bearing securitieswe consider our interest bearing security investment portfolio available for sale and accordingly these investment are recorded at fair value with unrealized gain and loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci investment with maturity beyond one year may be classified short term marketable security in the consolidated balance sheet due to their highly liquid nature and because they represent the company investment that are available for current operation see note investment and note fair value measurement inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost which includes amount related to material labor and overhead is determined in manner that approximates the first in first out method net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business le reasonably predictable cost of completion disposal and transportation see note inventory derivativeswe recognize all of our derivative instrument either asset or liability at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet the accounting for change in the fair value of derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative ha been formally designated and qualifies part of hedging relationship under the applicable accounting standard and further on the type of relationship for derivative formally designated hedge we ass both at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivative are highly effective in offsetting change in either the fair value or cash flow of the hedged item our derivative that are not designated and do not qualify hedge are adjusted to fair value through current earnings see note fair value measurement and note derivative instrument property plant and equipment netproperty plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost net of accumulated depreciation amortization and if applicable impairment charge we review our property plant and equipment asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable depreciation is provided over the asset useful life on straight line basis leasehold improvement are amortized on straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or lease term see note property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assetsfinite lived intangible asset are recorded at cost net of accumulated amortization and if applicable impairment charge amortization of finite lived intangible asset is provided over their estimated useful life on straight line basis or based on the pattern in which economic benefit are consumed if reliably determinable we review our finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable see note goodwill and other intangible asset the fair value of ipr project acquired in business combination that are not complete are capitalized and accounted for indefinite lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the related effort upon successful completion of the project the capitalized amount is amortized over it estimated useful life if project is abandoned all remaining capitalized amount are written off immediately there are often major risk and uncertainty associated with ipr project we are required to obtain regulatory approval in order to be able to market the resulting product such approval require completing clinical trial that demonstrate product candidate is safe and effective consequently the eventual realized value of the acquired ipr project may vary from it fair value at the date of acquisition and ipr impairment charge may occur in future period capitalized ipr project are tested for impairment annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable we consider various factor for potential impairment including the current legal and regulatory environment and the competitive landscape adverse clinical trial result significant delay in obtaining marketing approval the inability to bring product to market and the introduction or advancement of competitor product could result in partial or full impairment of the related intangible asset we perform an impairment test of goodwill annually and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable to date an impairment of goodwill ha not been recorded see note goodwill and other intangible asset contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in various legal proceeding government investigation and other matter that are complex in nature and have outcome that are difficult to predict certain of these proceeding are discussed in note contingency and commitment we record accrual for loss contingency to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated we evaluate on quarterly basis development in legal proceeding and other matter that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that ha been accrued previously foreign currency translationthe net asset of international subsidiary whose local currency have been determined to be the functional currency are translated into dollar using current exchange rate the dollar effect that arise from translating net asset of these subsidiary at changing rate are recognized in aoci the earnings of these subsidiary are translated into dollar using average exchange rate other recently adopted pronouncementsin january the fasb issued new accounting standard that amends the accounting and disclosure of financial instrument including provision requiring that equity investment except for investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting be measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in current earnings with the exception of equity investment that were previously accounted for at cost modified retrospective approach wa used to reflect the cumulative effect of adoption an adjustment to accumulated deficit of the beginning of the fiscal year the new standard will be applied prospectively to investment currently that were previously accounted for at cost upon adoption on january we recorded immaterial adjustment to accumulated deficit from aoci which represented the net unrealized gain on all equity investment with readily determinable fair value of december the impact that this new standard ha on our consolidated statement of income after adoption will depend on change in fair value of equity security in our portfolio in the future see note investment in october the fasb issued new accounting standard that amends the income tax accounting guidance for intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory the new standard requires that entity recognize the income tax consequence of an intercompany transfer of an asset other than inventory in the period the transfer occurs the current exception to defer the recognition of any tax impact on intercompany transfer of inventory until the inventory is sold to third party remains unaffected we adopted this standard of january and will apply it to any transaction occurring on or after the adoption date the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement however the impact on our consolidated financial statement in future period will depend on the fact and circumstance of future transaction in january the fasb issued new accounting standard that change the definition of business to assist entity with the evaluation of when set of asset acquired or disposed of should be considered business the new standard requires that an entity evaluate whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross asset acquired is concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset if so the set of asset would not be considered business the new standard also requires that business include at least one substantive process and it narrow the definition of output we adopted this standard of january adoption of this new standard may result in more transaction being accounted for asset acquisition versus business combination however the impact on our consolidated financial statement in future period will depend on the fact and circumstance of future transaction in august the fasb issued new accounting standard that amends the accounting and reporting of hedging activity which we elected to adopt early during the second quarter of among it provision the new standard eliminates the separate measurement and reporting of hedge ineffectiveness and ii permit an entity to recognize in earnings the initial fair value of an excluded component of hedging instrument fair value under systematic and rational method over the life of the derivative instrument in accordance with the transition provision of the new standard the separate measurement of ineffectiveness for our cash flow hedging instrument existing of the date of adoption is required to be eliminated through cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of january the beginning of the fiscal year in addition certain provision in the guidance require modification to existing presentation and disclosure requirement on prospective basis the adoption of this standard did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement see note derivative instrument other recent accounting pronouncementsin february the fasb issued new accounting standard that amends the guidance for the accounting and disclosure of lease this new standard requires that lessee recognize on the balance sheet the asset and liability that arise from lease including lease classified operating lease under current gaap and disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangement the new standard requires modified retrospective approach to adoption and is effective for interim and annual period beginning on january in july the fasb further amended this standard to allow for new transition method that offer the option to use the effective date the date of initial application we intend to elect this alternative transition method and therefore will not adjust comparative period financial information in addition we intend to elect the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance of the new standard to not reassess prior conclusion related to contract that are or that contain lease lease classification and initial direct cost we do not expect that this standard will have material impact on our consolidated statement of income the primary effect of adoption will be the requirement to record the present value of lease liability for current operating lease and corresponding right of use rou asset upon adoption we estimate we will have additional liability ranging from million to million with corresponding rou asset of similar amount for lease agreement in effect of december the actual impact will depend on our lease portfolio at the time of adoption we are currently finalizing the implementation of the lease accounting information system documenting process and establishing internal control to properly track record and account for our lease portfolio the new standard also provides practical expedient for the ongoing accounting we also currently expect to elect the practical expedient to not separate lease and nonlease component for most of our asset class in june the fasb issued new accounting standard that amends the guidance for measuring and recording credit loss on financial asset measured at amortized cost by replacing the incurred loss model with an expected loss model accordingly these financial asset will be presented at the net amount expected to be collected this new standard also requires that credit loss related to available for sale debt security be recorded an allowance through net income rather than reducing the carrying amount under the current other than temporary impairment model the new standard is effective for interim and annual period beginning on january but may be adopted earlier beginning on january with certain exception adjustment are to be applied using modified retrospective approach by reflecting adjustment through cumulative effect impact on retained earnings of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption we are currently evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statement restructuringin we initiated restructuring plan to invest in continuing innovation and the launch of our new pipeline molecule while improving our cost structure part of the plan we closed facility in washington state and colorado and are reducing the number of building we occupy at our headquarters in thousand oak california well at other location we completed the activity associated with this restructuring plan in through december we incurred million of separation cost and other

for step acquisition of business in which we were required to remeasure our existing ownership interest at fair value in addition we were required to effectively settle our preexisting relationship

of the share acquisition date the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed consisted of cash of million licensing right of million deferred tax liability of million other asset and liability of million and goodwill of million the estimated fair value of acquired licensing right wa determined by using probability weighted income approach which discount expected future cash flow to present value by using discount rate that represents the estimated rate that market participant would use to value the asset the projected cash flow were based on certain assumption including estimate of future revenue and expense and the time and resource needed to maintain the asset through commercialization the licensing right will be amortized over weighted average period of four year by using the straight line method the excess of the share acquisition date consideration over the fair value assigned to the asset acquired and the liability assumed of million wa recorded goodwill which is not deductible for tax purpose the million in other asset and liability represents primarily receivables for royalty earned by but not yet received offset partially by payable representing expense

requiring that observable input be used when available observable input are input that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the input that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstance the fair value hierarchy is divided into three level based on the source of input follows level valuation based on unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability that the company ha the ability to accesslevel valuation for which all significant input are observable either directly or indirectly other than level inputslevel valuation based on input that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurementthe availability of observable input can vary among the various type of financial asset and liability to the extent that the valuation is based on model or input that are le observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment in certain case the input used for measuring fair value may fall into different level of the fair value hierarchy in such case for financial statement disclosure purpose the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input used that is significant to the overall fair value measurement fair value of each major class of the company
