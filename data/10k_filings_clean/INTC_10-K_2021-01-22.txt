foreign currency contract designated cash flow hedge to manage this risk substantially all of our revenue is transacted in dollar however significant portion of our operating expenditure and capital purchase are incurred in other currency primarily the euro the japanese yen the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan we have established currency risk management program to protect against currency exchange rate risk associated with non dollar forecasted future cash flow and existing non dollar monetary asset and liability we may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency denominated future investment we may utilize foreign currency contract such currency forward or option contract in these hedging program we considered the historical trend in currency exchange rate

anticipate result or trend in future period refer also to the other information set forth in this form including in the md and financial statement and supplemental detail section change in product demand can adversely affect our financial result demand for our product is variable and hard to predict our product are used in different market segment and demand for our product varies within or among the market segment served by our pc centric and data centric business it is difficult to forecast these change and their impact for example we saw negative covid driven demand impact in several area of our business during the second half of discussed in md and the nature and extent of future impact are difficult to predict change in the demand for our product particularly our ccg and dcg platform product can reduce our revenue lower our gross margin or require to write down the value of our asset important factor that lead to variation in the demand for our product include business condition including downturn in the market segment in which we operate or in global or regional economy consumer confidence or income level and the level of customer capital spending which may be impacted by change in market condition including change in government borrowing taxation or spending policy the credit market expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity price our ability to timely introduce competitive product competitive and pricing pressure including new product introduction and other action taken by competitor the level of our customer inventory and computing capacity customer order pattern including order cancellation which can be affected by maturing product cycle for our product customer product and related product such operating system upgrade cycle disruption affecting customer and other factor market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing product including the introduction and availability of product used together with our product and customer product need and emerging technology trend including change in the level and nature of customer and end user computing workload due to the complexity of our manufacturing operation we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuation in demand and we may incur significant charge and cost because we own and operate high tech fabrication facility our operation have high cost that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our cost related to utilization of existing facility facility construction and equipment and the employment and training of highly skilled workforce to the extent product demand decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charge which would lower our gross margin to the extent the demand decrease is prolonged our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our long lived asset which would increase our expense we may also be required to shorten the useful life of under used facility and equipment and accelerate depreciation conversely at time product demand increase or we fail to forecast accurately or produce the mix of product demanded and we are unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough or otherwise fail to meet market demand which can result in loss of revenue opportunity or market share legal claim and or damage to customer relationship we face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market development change in industry standard change in customer and end user need expectation and preference and frequent product introduction and improvement when we do not anticipate and or respond to these development our competitive position can weaken and our product or technology can become uncompetitive or obsolete our competitive environment ha intensified and we expect it to continue to do so in the future our product primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration ease of use innovative design feature workload optimization price quality reliability security software ecosystem and developer support time to market reliable product roadmap execution brand recognition customer support and customization and availability the importance of these factor varies by product and market segment for example our competitor have introduced data center and client platform product with performance improvement and additional processor core count that have contributed to an increasingly competitive environment in our iotg business for example interoperability connectivity safety security industrial use condition and long life support are among the key competitive factor to the extent our product do not meet our customer requirement across these factor in an increasingly competitive landscape our business and result of operation can be harmed other key of contentswe face intense competition across our product portfolio from company offering platform product such amd and qualcomm accelerator product such gpus including those offered by nvidia other accelerator product such asics application specific standard product and fpgas memory and storage product connectivity and networking product and other semiconductor product some of these competitor have developed or utilize competing computing architecture and platform such the arm architecture and these architecture and platform can produce beneficial network effect for competitor when an ecosystem of customer and application developer for such architecture and platform grows at scale for example arm based product are being used in pc and server which could lead to further development and growth of the arm ecosystem we also compete with internally developed semiconductor from oems cloud service provider and others some of are customer some of these customer vertically integrate their own semiconductor design with their software asset and or customize their design for specific computing workload for example in apple introduced pc product utilizing it own internally developed arm based semiconductor design in place of our client cpu most of our competitor rely on third party foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd tsmc or samsung electronics co ltd and subcontractor for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor component and product manufacturing process improvement introduced by tsmc have contributed and may continue to contribute to increasingly competitive offering by our competitor an idm we have higher capital expenditure and spending than many of our fable competitor we also face new source of competition result of change in industry participant through for example acquisition or business collaboration well new entrant including in china which could have significant impact on our competitive position for example we could face increased competition result of china program to promote domestic semiconductor industry and supply chain introduction of competitive new product and technology aggressive pricing and other action taken by competitor can harm demand for our product exert downward pricing pressure on our product and adversely affect our business for example our dcg platform asp were impacted by the competitive pricing environment during additionally number of business combination and strategic partnership in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several year and more could occur in the future for example in nvidia announced an agreement to acquire arm holding plc and amd announced an agreement to acquire xilinx inc consolidation could also lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result if we are not able to compete effectively our financial result will be adversely affected including reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the write down of the value of certain asset we invest significantly in and to the extent our effort are unsuccessful our competitive position can be harmed and we may not realize return on our investment to compete successfully we must maintain successful effort develop new product and manufacturing process and improve our existing product and process all ahead of competitor we are focusing our effort across several key area process and packaging technology architecture memory interconnect security and software these include ambitious initiative such our unified oneapi portfolio of developer tool we can not guarantee that all of these effort will deliver the benefit we anticipate for example we previously experienced significant delay in the implementation of our process technology and during we announced that our process technology would be delayed relative to our prior expectation discussed in the risk factor we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology to the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technology that improve transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yield and operational efficiency relative to competing foundry process we can face cost product performance and time to market disadvantage in addition we are not always able to timely or successfully develop new product design to the extent our effort do not timely produce semiconductor design for our platform product with improvement in area like performance performance per watt die utilization and core count and with new feature such optimization for ai and other workload our competitive position can be harmed we have adopted disaggregated design approach for some of our future product in which different processor and component can be manufactured on different process and connected by advanced packaging technology into single package this approach introduces new area of complexity in design and manufacturability particularly in the deployment of advanced packaging technology several of which are novel have limited manufacturing history and or have increased cost delay or failure in implementing disaggregated design could adversely affect our ability to timely introduce competitive product for example adapting processor or component design for new or different manufacturing process involves additional expense and can result in delay in the development of the associated product we do not expect all of our investment to be successful some of our effort to develop and market new product fail and the product and technology we invest in and develop are not always well received by customer who may adopt competing technology we make significant investment in and our investment at time do not contribute to our future operating result for several year if at all and such contribution at time do not meet our expectation or even cover the cost of such investment our investment in new business product and technology are inherently risky and do not always succeed in recent year we have entered new area and introduced new product we seek to lead in key technology inflection such ai networking and the intelligent and autonomous edge we have expanded our adjacent product offering in client computing the data center the internet of thing and memory with offering such discrete gpus silicon photonics solution and intel optane technology product these effort are not always successful for example in we exited the smartphone modem business based on our determination that there wa no clear path to profitability for the business other key of contentsthese new and developing area and product represent significant portion of our expanded tam and they also introduce new source of competition including in some of these market segment incumbent competitor with established technology ecosystem and customer base lower price or cost and greater brand recognition these developing product and market segment require significant investment do not always grow projected or at all or sometimes utilize technology that are different from the one that we develop and manufacture and we may not realize an adequate return on our investment for example ai and machine learning are increasingly driving innovation in technology but if we fail to develop leading product for these workload or if our customer use competing technology we may not realize return on our investment in these area similarly while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our effort to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationship with customer and partner in these market segment in addition we must continually improve the cost performance integration time to market and energy efficiency of our product well expand our software capability to provide customer with comprehensive computing solution some of these new business face challenging market condition for example market pricing for nand memory product ha been and may continue to be highly volatile despite our ongoing effort there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our product and service in these various market segment or realize an adequate return on our investment which could lead to impairment of asset and restructuring charge well opportunity cost change in the mix of product sold can materially impact our financial result our pricing and margin vary across our product and market segment due in part to marketability of our product and difference in their feature or manufacturing cost for example our platform product offering range from lower priced and entry level platform such those based on intel atom processor to higher end platform based on intel xeon processor our adjacent product also typically have significantly lower margin than our higher priced platform product and at time are not profitable to the extent demand shift from our higher priced to lower priced platform product in any of our market segment or our adjacent product represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of product sold our gross margin percentage may decrease we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing technology production of integrated circuit is complex process we are continually engaged in the development of next generation process technology at increasingly advanced node we seek to realize the benefit of moore law forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced node is challenging and at time we encounter unexpected delay due to the complexity of interaction among step in the manufacturing process challenge in using new material and other issue diagnosing defect in our manufacturing process often take long time manufacturing throughput time can delay our receipt of data about defect and the effectiveness of fix we are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process node and manufacturing process we experienced significant delay in implementing our process technology although we began shipping product based on our process technology in volume in our delay in transitioning to this node occurred while third party foundry such tsmc developed new competitive process technology competitor using third party foundry are able to benefit from the improvement such process technology have made in performance energy efficiency and other feature which ha helped increase the competitiveness of their product in we encountered defect mode in the development of our process technology that resulted in yield degradation which wa the primary driver for delay in our expectation for our based cpu product timing these delay can allow competitor to benefit from advancement in manufacturing process introduced ahead of by third party foundry and could adversely affect the competitiveness of our product because of the delay in our and process technology we may experience greater adverse competitive impact in the event of delay in the development of future manufacturing process technology and product to increase our manufacturing and design flexibility we have developed disaggregated design approach for certain product which enables to manufacture processor and component on different process technology including third party foundry process and connect them in single package with advanced packaging technology this approach introduces additional risk described in the risk factor we face supply chain risk our effort to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risk including difficulty in designing and developing next generation process technology and investment in manufacturing asset and facility that are made year in advance of the process node introduction we can not guarantee that we will realize the expected benefit of next generation process technology including the expected cost and density advantage or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and investment particularly development of new node ha grown increasingly expensive in such circumstance we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing asset and facility increasing our expense other key of contentsrisks inherent in the development of next generation process technology include production timing delay lower than anticipated manufacturing yield longer manufacturing throughput time and product defect and erratum production timing delay have at time caused to miss customer product design window which can result in lost revenue opportunity and damage to our customer relationship furthermore when the introduction of next generation process node is delayed including additional core or other competitive feature in our product can result in larger die size product manufacturing supply constraint and increased product cost lower manufacturing yield and longer manufacturing throughput time compared to previous process node can increase our product cost and adversely affect our gross margin and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraint when we introduce new process node it typically ha higher cost compared to mature node due to factor that include higher depreciation cost and lower yield for example our increased product mix in had negative impact on our overall unit cost and gross margin and yield on our manufacturing process remain below our mature process in addition the improvement we expect to make in cost and yield may not proceed at the same rate the improvement we made on the die size of our product ha increased and our manufacturing process node have shrunk our product and manufacturing process have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defect and erratum which at time also contribute to production timing delay and lower yield from time to time disruption in the production process result from error defect in material delay in obtaining or revising operating permit and license interruption in our supply of material or resource and disruption at our fabrication and assembly and test facility due to accident maintenance issue power interruption equipment malfunction or unsafe working condition all of which could affect the timing of production ramp and yield production issue periodically lead to increased cost and affect our ability to meet product demand which can adversely impact our business and the result of operation in addition delay in our product introduction can cause to become le competitive and lose revenue opportunity and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant cost up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these cost over time we face supply chain risk thousand of supplier provide material and equipment that we use in production and other aspect of our business where possible we seek to have several source of supply however for certain material and equipment including certain photolithography tool we rely on single or limited number of supplier or upon supplier in single location in addition supplier consolidation or business failure can impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the product and service available to finding and qualifying alternate or additional supplier is often lengthy process and can lead to production delay or additional cost and such alternative are sometimes not available at all the inability of supplier to deliver necessary production material or equipment can disrupt our production process and make it more difficult for to implement our business strategy supplier periodically extend lead time face capacity constraint limit supply increase price experience quality issue or encounter cybersecurity or other issue that can interrupt or increase the cost of our supply our production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resource such water silicon electricity gas and other material the unavailability or reduced availability of material or resource at time requires to reduce production or incur additional cost which could harm our business and result of operation our manufacturing operation and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our supplier where an injunction against intel or supplier could interrupt the availability of good or service supplied to intel by others we also rely on third party provider to manufacture assemble and test and supply certain component and product including for area such networking communication programmable semiconductor solution and memory we may utilize third party provider for these and other component and product in the future from time to time these third party are unable to perform these service on timely or cost effective basis in sufficient volume or at all in some case there are limited or no readily available satisfactory alternate provider in any of these circumstance we can encounter supply delay or disruption or incur additional cost that could prevent from meeting customer demand and or adversely affect our business and financial result for example while we have supply agreement with micron providing for the supply of intel xpoint memory we may need to fund and develop internal manufacturing option to continue xpoint memory supply in the longer term we typically have le control over delivery schedule design and manufacturing co optimization manufacturing yield quality product quantity and cost for component and product that are manufactured or supplied by third party our disaggregated design strategy pose increased logistical risk and challenge particularly where we decide to manufacture different component on different process technology including third party foundry process technology to combine component in single package they need to be manufactured on timely basis and in sufficient quantity while the manufacturing process we utilize may have differing yield throughput time and capacity constraint we may be required to safely store some component pending the manufacture of others delay or quality issue with one component could limit our ability to manufacture the entire completed product in addition the packaging technology used to combine these component can increase our cost and may introduce additional complexity and quality issue to the extent we are unable to manage these risk our ability to timely supply competitive product can be harmed our cost could increase and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected increased regulation or stakeholder expectation regarding responsible sourcing practice could cause our compliance cost to increase or result in publicity that negatively affect our reputation moreover given that we use many material in the manufacturing of our product and rely on many supplier to provide these material but do not directly control the procurement or employment practice of such supplier we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risk result of our supplier conduct other key of contentswe are subject to the risk of product defect erratum or other product issue from time to time we identify product defect erratum deviation from published specification and other product issue which can result from problem in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test process component and product we purchase or license from third party supplier or attain through acquisition can also contain defect product issue can lead to product failure unpredictable system behavior system instability and other issue and sometimes result from the interaction between our product and third party product and software we also face risk if product that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defect or erratum these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market segment technology or application including transportation autonomous driving healthcare communication financial service and other industrial critical infrastructure and consumer us cost from defect erratum or other product issue could include writing off some or all of the value of inventory recalling product that have been shipped providing product replacement or modification providing consideration to customer including reimbursement for certain cost they incur defending against litigation and or paying resulting damage and paying fine imposed by regulatory agency these cost could be large and may increase expense and lower gross margin and or result in delay or loss of revenue mitigation technique designed to address product issue including software and firmware update are not always available on timely basis or at all and do not always operate intended or effectively resolve such issue for all application and can result in adverse performance or power effect we and third party such hardware and software vendor may make prioritization decision about which product issue to address which can delay limit or prevent development or deployment of mitigation and harm our reputation and result in cost product defect erratum or other issue can damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product release result in legal liability or make our product le competitive which could harm our business and financial result in addition our liability insurance coverage ha certain exclusion or may not adequately cover liability incurred our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim and loss not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition we face risk related to security vulnerability in our product we or third party regularly identify security vulnerability with respect to our processor and other product well the operating system and workload that run on them and the component that interact with them component and ip we purchase or license from third party for use in our product well industry standard specification we implement in our product are also regularly subject to security vulnerability we have become more data centric company our processor and other product are being used in additional and new critical application area that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risk including application that gather and process large amount of data such the cloud or internet of thing and critical infrastructure and automotive application the security vulnerability identified in our processor include category known side channel vulnerability such the variant referred to spectre and meltdown additional category and variant have been identified and are expected to continue to be identified publicity about these and other security vulnerability ha resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased attempt by third party to identify additional vulnerability including with respect to security and manageability feature in our product vulnerability are not always mitigated before they become known we our customer and the user of our product do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully ass the magnitude or effect of vulnerability including the extent if any to which vulnerability ha been exploited subsequent event or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of security vulnerability including additional information learned we develop and deploy mitigation or update become aware of additional variant evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new product and address future warranty or other claim or customer satisfaction consideration well development in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiry or action over these matter mitigation technique designed to address security vulnerability including software and firmware update or other preventative measure are not always available on timely basis or at all and at time do not operate intended or effectively resolve vulnerability for all application in addition we are often required to rely on third party including hardware software and service vendor well our customer and end user to develop and or deploy mitigation technique and the availability effectiveness and performance impact of mitigation technique can depend solely or in part on the action of these third party in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigation we and such third party may make prioritization decision about which vulnerability to address which can delay limit or prevent development or deployment of mitigation and harm our reputation security vulnerability and or mitigation technique can result in adverse performance or power effect reboots system instability or unavailability loss of functionality data loss or corruption unpredictable system behavior decision by customer and end user to limit or change the application in which they use our product or product feature and or the misappropriation of data by third party other key of contentssecurity vulnerability and any limitation of or adverse effect resulting from mitigation technique can adversely affect our result of operation financial condition customer relationship prospect and reputation in number of way any of which may be material for example whether or not vulnerability involve attempted or successful exploit they may result in our incurring significant cost related to developing and deploying update and mitigation writing down inventory value defending against product claim and litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage addressing customer satisfaction consideration providing product replacement or modification or taking other remedial step with respect to third party adverse publicity about security vulnerability or mitigation could damage our reputation with customer or user and reduce demand for our product and service these effect may be greater to the extent that competing product are not susceptible to the same vulnerability or if vulnerability can be more effectively mitigated in competing product moreover third party can release information regarding potential vulnerability of our product before mitigation are available which in turn could lead to attempted or successful exploit adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigation or otherwise harm our business and reputation we are subject to risk associated with environmental health and safety regulation the manufacturing and assembly and test of our product require the use of hazardous material that are subject to broad array of environmental health and safety law and regulation our failure to comply with these law or regulation can result in regulatory penalty fine and legal liability suspension of production alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test process damage to our reputation and restriction on our operation or sale our failure to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous material can lead to increased cost or future liability our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulation such air quality and wastewater requirement environmental law and regulation sometimes require to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product design or incur other expense regulation in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing cost associated with air pollution requirement and increased compliance and energy cost many new material that we are evaluating for use in our operation are subject to regulation under environmental law and regulation these restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter manufacturing and assembly and test process the covid pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation the covid pandemic ha adversely affected significant portion of our business and could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation we are subject to numerous pandemic related risk including those described below the degree to which covid impact our result will depend on future development which are highly uncertain and can not be predicted including but not limited to the duration and severity of the pandemic the action taken to contain the virus or treat it impact other action taken by government business and individual in response to the virus and resulting economic disruption and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating condition can resume we are similarly unable to predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customer supplier vendor and other partner and their financial condition but material effect on these party could also materially adversely affect operational risk the pandemic ha resulted in authority imposing and business and individual implementing numerous measure to try to contain the virus such travel ban and restriction quarantine shelter in place stay at home and social distancing order and shutdown these measure have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operation the operation of our customer and those of our respective vendor supplier and partner we have significant manufacturing operation in the ireland israel china malaysia and vietnam and each of these country ha been affected by the pandemic and is taking measure to try to contain it there is considerable uncertainty regarding the business impact from such measure and potential future measure shelter in place order and other measure including work from home and social distancing policy implemented to protect employee have resulted in reduced workforce availability at some of our site construction delay and reduced capacity at some of our vendor and supplier restriction on our manufacturing or support operation or workforce or similar limitation for our vendor and supplier can impact our ability to meet customer demand and could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation particularly if prolonged similarly current and future restriction or disruption of transportation can also impact our ability to meet demand and could materially adversely affect our customer have experienced and may in the future experience disruption in their operation and supply chain which can result in delayed reduced or cancelled order or collection risk and which may adversely affect our result of operation we previously paused new construction project at several of our manufacturing site due to local government restriction while these restriction were subsequently lifted similar restriction affecting construction could be imposed in the future the pandemic ha caused to modify our business practice including with respect to employee travel employee work location cancellation of physical participation in meeting event and conference and social distancing measure we may take further action required by government authority or others or that we determine are in the best interest of our employee customer supplier vendor and partner work from home and other measure introduce additional operational risk including cybersecurity risk and have affected the way we conduct our product development validation and qualification customer support and other activity which could have material adverse effect on our operation there is no certainty that such measure will be sufficient to mitigate the risk posed by the virus and illness and workforce disruption could lead to unavailability of key personnel and harm our ability to perform critical function other key of contentsdemand and macroeconomic risk the pandemic ha significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty it ha caused significant contraction in the global economy and there is considerable uncertainty to the severity and duration of the contraction risk related to adverse change in global economic condition are described in our risk factor titled global or regional condition can harm our financial result and include the risk that demand for our product will be significantly harmed during the second half of in particular we saw negative covid related demand trend in several area of our data centric business well covid related change in product mix that drove lower asp in our pc centric business discussed in md given the continued and substantial economic uncertainty and volatility created by the pandemic it is difficult to predict the nature and extent of impact on demand for our product for example the increased demand for notebook product result of work and learn from home dynamic may not continue the pandemic progress or demand mix shift that have been pronounced during the pandemic and have negatively impacted our asp could continue such the mix shift from desktop to notebook product in our ccg business and the mix shift from the enterprise and government market segment to the cloud service provider market segment in dcg liquidity risk the pandemic ha led to increased disruption and volatility in capital market and credit market unanticipated consequence of the pandemic and resulting economic uncertainty could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resource in the future other risk the impact of covid can also exacerbate other risk discussed in this risk factor section and throughout this report which could in turn have material adverse effect on development related to covid have been unpredictable and additional impact and risk may arise that we are not aware of or able to respond to appropriately we operate globally and are subject to significant risk in many jurisdiction global or regional condition can harm our financial result we have manufacturing assembly and test sale and other operation in many country and some of our business activity are concentrated in one or more geographic area moreover sale outside the accounted for of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december with revenue from billing to china including hong kong contributing of our total revenue result our operation and our financial result including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell product and the demand for our product are at time adversely affected by number of global and regional factor outside of our control adverse change in global or regional economic condition periodically occur including recession or slowing growth change or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rate tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditure by business including on it infrastructure increase in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending the covid pandemic ha caused significant contraction in the global economy and there is considerable uncertainty to it severity and duration adverse change in economic condition including those related to the pandemic can significantly harm demand for our product and make it more challenging to forecast our operating result and make business decision including regarding prioritization of investment in our business an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risk higher borrowing cost or reduced availability of capital market reduced liquidity adverse impact on our supplier failure of counterparties including financial institution and insurer asset impairment and decline in the value of our financial instrument we can be adversely affected by other global and regional factor that periodically occur including geopolitical and security issue such armed conflict and civil or military unrest political instability human right concern and terrorist activity including for example geopolitical tension and conflict affecting israel where our mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facility are located natural disaster public health issue including the covid pandemic and other catastrophic event inefficient infrastructure and other disruption such supply chain interruption and large scale outage or unreliable provision of service from utility transportation data hosting or telecommunication provider formal or informal imposition of new or revised export import or business regulation including trade sanction tariff and change in the ability to obtain export license which could be changed without notice government restriction on or nationalization of our operation in any country or restriction on our ability to repatriate earnings from particular country adverse change relating to government grant tax credit or other government incentive including more favorable incentive provided to competitor differing employment practice and labor issue ineffective legal protection of our ip right in certain country local business and cultural factor that differ from our current standard and practice continuing uncertainty regarding social political immigration and tax and trade policy in the and abroad including result of the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union and fluctuation in the market value of our domestic and international investment which can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or loss interest rate change financial result political risk sovereign risk or other factor other key of contentswe are also subject to risk related to uncertainty regarding libor certain of our interest rate derivative and investment are based on libor and portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rate primarily based on libor libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposal for reform which may cause libor to disappear entirely after or to perform differently than in the past while we expect that reasonable alternative to libor will be implemented prior to the target date or that the cessation date may be extended we can not predict the consequence and timing of these development and they could include an increase in our interest expense and or reduction in our interest income we are subject to risk related to trade policy and regulation trade policy and dispute at time result in increased tariff trade barrier and other protectionist measure which can increase our manufacturing cost make our product le competitive reduce demand for our product limit our ability to sell to certain customer limit our ability to procure component or raw material or impede or slow the movement of our good across border increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further change in trade policy and regulation domestic sourcing initiative or other formal and informal measure that could make it more difficult to sell our product in or restrict our access to some market in particular trade tension between the and china have led to increased tariff and trade restriction including tariff applicable to some of our product and have affected customer ordering pattern the ha imposed restriction on the export of regulated product and technology to certain chinese technology company including certain of our customer these restriction have reduced our sale and continuing or future restriction could adversely affect our financial performance result in reputational harm to due to our relationship with such company or lead such company to develop or adopt technology that compete with our product it is difficult to predict what further trade related action government may take which may include trade restriction and additional or increased tariff and export control imposed on short notice and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to or mitigate such action trade dispute and protectionist measure or continued uncertainty about such matter could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession and could cause our customer to reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchase with sustained geopolitical tension could lead to long term change in global trade and technology supply chain and decoupling of global trade network which could have material adverse effect on our business and growth prospect law and regulation can have negative impact on our business we are subject to law and regulation worldwide that differ among jurisdiction affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement anti corruption foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement competition advertising employment product regulation environment health and safety requirement and consumer law compliance with such requirement can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operation negatively for example unfavorable development with evolving law and regulation worldwide related to or autonomous driving technology may limit global adoption impede our strategy or negatively impact our long term expectation for our investment in these area expanding privacy legislation and compliance cost of privacy related and data protection measure could adversely affect our customer and their product and service particularly in cloud internet of thing and ai application which could in turn reduce demand for our product used for those workload although we have policy control and procedure designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier or agent will not violate such law or our policy violation of these law and regulation can result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation the technology industry is subject to intense medium political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigation legal action and penalty we are affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate we are exposed to adverse well beneficial movement in currency exchange rate although most of our sale occur in dollar expense may be paid in local currency an increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar can increase the cost of expense such payroll utility tax and marketing expense well overseas capital expenditure we also conduct certain investing and financing activity in local currency our hedging program may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movement therefore change in exchange rate can harm our result of operation and financial condition catastrophic event can have material adverse effect on our operation and financial result our operation and business and those of our customer and supplier can be disrupted by natural disaster industrial accident public health issue including the covid pandemic cybersecurity incident interruption of service from utility transportation telecommunication or it system provider manufacturing equipment failure or other catastrophic event for example we have at time experienced disruption in our manufacturing process result of power outage improperly functioning equipment and disruption in supply of raw material or component including due to cybersecurity incident affecting our supplier our headquarters and many of our operation and facility are in location that are prone to earthquake and other natural disaster global climate change can result in certain natural disaster occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such drought wildfire storm sea level rise and flooding and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facility located in semi arid region during the west coast of the experienced historic wildfire including in oregon where we have major manufacturing facility the long term effect of climate change on the global economy and the it industry in particular are unclear but could be severe other key of contentscatastrophic event could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver product to our customer receive production material from our supplier or perform critical function which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation while we maintain business recovery plan some of our system are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plan will fully protect from such disruption furthermore even if our operation are unaffected or recover quickly if our customer or supplier can not timely resume their own operation due to catastrophic event we may experience reduced or cancelled order or disruption to our supply chain that may adversely affect our result of operation we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decision with respect to risk retention some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion in addition one or more of our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition damage to our reputation can damage our business our reputation is critical factor in our relationship with customer employee government supplier and other stakeholder our failure to address or the appearance of our failure to address issue that give rise to reputational risk including those described throughout this risk factor section could significantly harm our reputation and our brand our reputation can be impacted by catastrophic event including our response to the covid pandemic incident involving unethical behavior or misconduct product quality security or safety issue allegation of legal noncompliance internal control failure corporate governance issue data breach workplace safety incident environmental incident the use of our product for illegal or objectionable application including ai and machine learning application that present ethical regulatory or other issue marketing practice medium statement the conduct of our supplier or representative and other issue or incident that whether actual or perceived result in adverse publicity to the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate crisis the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brand and could lead to increase in litigation claim and asserted damage or subject to regulatory action or restriction damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our product and adversely affect our business and operating environment it could reduce investor confidence in adversely affecting our stock price it may also limit our ability to be seen an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employee moreover repairing our reputation and brand may be difficult time consuming and expensive we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risk we face risk related to cybersecurity threat and incident we regularly face attempt by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it system individual or organization including malicious hacker state sponsored organization insider threat including employee and third party service provider or intruder into our physical facility at time attempt to gain unauthorized access and or corrupt the process used to design and manufacture our hardware product and our associated software and service due to the widespread use of our product we are frequent target of computer hacker and organization that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other process product and service we are also target of malicious attacker who attempt to gain access to our network or data center or those of our supplier customer or end user steal proprietary information related to our business product employee supplier and customer interrupt our system and service or those of our supplier customer or others or demand ransom to return control of such system and service such attempt are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful expose and the affected party to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruption of our business operation including our manufacturing operation our it infrastructure also includes product and service provided by third party and these provider can experience breach of their system and product that impact the security of our system and our proprietary or confidential information from time to time we encounter intrusion or unauthorized access to our network product service or infrastructure well those of third party who provide product and service to for example in the fourth quarter of our habana lab subsidiary network wa breached resulting in unauthorized third party access of certain confidential information in connection with suspected unsuccessful ransomware attack the breach wa confined to our subsidiary network and is not expected to have material impact on habana lab business we are also subject to risk associated with attack involving our supply chain in the fourth quarter of we became aware of report that an update to widely used it infrastructure management software provided by one of our vendor solarwinds corporation had been compromised by attacker and we are investigating these report to date cybersecurity incident have not resulted in material adverse impact to our business or operation but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact such incident whether or not successful could result in our incurring significant cost related to for example rebuilding internal system

harmful to our reputation and distracting to management we must attract retain and motivate key employee hiring and retaining qualified executive scientist engineer technical staff and sale representative are critical to our business the competition for highly skilled employee in our industry is increasingly intense competitor for technical talent increasingly seek to hire our employee in addition change in immigration policy may further limit the pool of available talent and impair our ability to recruit and hire technical and professional talent change in the interpretation and application of employment related law to our workforce practice may also result in increased operating cost and le flexibility in how we meet our changing workforce need to help attract retain and motivate qualified employee we use share based award such rsus and performance based cash incentive award our employee hiring and retention also depend on our ability to build and maintain diverse and inclusive workplace culture and be viewed an employer of choice if our share based or other compensation program and workplace culture cease to be viewed competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate employee would be weakened which could harm our result of operation moreover sustained decline in our stock price can reduce the retention value of our share based award change in our

acquisition moreover our resource are limited and our decision to pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we at time need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction that could help achieve our financial or strategic objective other key of contentswhere an existing investment doe not meet our criterion for success we routinely evaluate opportunity for possible divestiture and other option we may not realize the anticipated benefit of divestiture such the pending divestiture of our nand memory business to sk hynix due to

are non marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment and we are not always able to achieve return in timely fashion if at all our ability to realize return on our investment in

stock our product at time we rely on one or more key distributor for product and material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributor or their failure to perform expected could reduce our revenue our ability to add or replace distributor for some of our product is limited in addition our distributor expertise in the determination and stocking of acceptable inventory level for some of our product is not always easily transferable to new distributor result end customer may be hesitant to accept the addition or replacement of distributor using third party for distribution expose to many risk including competitive pressure and concentration credit and compliance risk distributor and other third party sell product that compete with our product and we sometimes need to provide financial and other incentive to focus them on the sale of our product from time to time they face financial difficulty including bankruptcy which could harm our collection of account

consolidated financial statement in conformity with gaap requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the amount reported in our consolidated financial statement and the accompanying note the input into our judgment and estimate consider the economic implication of covid on our critical and significant accounting estimate the actual result that we experience may differ materially from our estimate note accounting policiesrevenue recognitionwe recognize net product revenue when we satisfy performance obligation evidenced by the transfer of control of our product or service to customer substantially all of our revenue is derived from product sale in accordance with contract term revenue for product sale is recognized at the time of product shipment from our facility or delivery to the customer location determined by the agreed upon shipping term we measure revenue based on the amount of consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for product or service variable consideration is estimated and reflected an adjustment to the transaction price we determine variable consideration which consists primarily of various sale price concession by estimating the most likely amount of consideration we expect to receive from the customer based on historical analysis of customer purchase volume sale rebate earned by customer are offset against their receivable balance rebate earned by customer when they do not have outstanding receivable balance are recorded within other accrued liability we make payment to our customer through cooperative advertising program for marketing activity for some of our product we generally record the payment reduction in revenue in the period that the revenue is earned unless the payment is for distinct service which we record expense when the marketing activity occur inventorieswe compute inventory cost on first in first out basis our process and product development life cycle corresponds with substantive engineering milestone these engineering milestone are regularly and consistently applied in assessing the point at which our activity and associated cost change in nature from to cost of sale and when cost of sale can be capitalized inventory for product to be manufactured in high volume and sold to our customer under our standard warranty it must meet our rigorous technical quality specification this milestone is known prq we have identified prq the point at which the cost incurred to manufacture our product are included in the valuation of inventory single prq ha previously valued inventory up to million in the quarter the prq milestone wa achieved prior to prq cost that do not meet the criterion for are included in cost of sale in the period incurred the valuation of inventory includes determining which fixed production overhead cost can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facility we apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in statistical model to determine our normal capacity level if the factory loading are below the established normal capacity level portion of our fixed production overhead cost would not be included in the cost of inventory instead it would be recognized cost of sale in that period we refer to these cost excess capacity charge excess capacity charge are insignificant in the year presented charge in year prior to those presented have ranged up to billion taken in connection with the economic recession inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and market condition product specific fact and circumstance reviewed in the inventory valuation process include review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle variation in market pricing and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserve fluctuate we ramp new process technology with cost improving over time due to scale and improved yield additionally inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical change in market condition and the associated pricing environment financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsthe valuation of inventory also requires to estimate obsolete and excess inventory well inventory that is not of salable quality we use the demand forecast to develop our short term manufacturing plan to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decision for certain new product we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecast we compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished good inventory level to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory when our demand forecast for specific product is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we write off amount considered to be excess inventory property plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of asset we also capitalize interest on borrowing related to eligible capital expenditure capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified asset and depreciated together with that asset cost we record capital related government grant earned reduction to property plant and equipment we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property plant and equipment considering factor such the process technology cadence between node transition change in machinery and equipment technology and re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology we make manufacturing process conversion and other factory planning decision we use assumption involving the use of management judgment regarding the remaining useful life of asset primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tool and building improvement when we determine that the useful life of asset are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the asset revised useful life asset are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow factor that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of business or product line in relation to expectation significant negative industry or economic trend and significant change or planned change in our use and fungibility of the asset if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired fair valuewhen determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact well assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial asset are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis except for equity security measured using the measurement alternative equity method investment grant receivable and reverse repurchase agreement with original maturity greater than three month we ass fair value hierarchy level for our issued debt and fixed income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type the three level of input that may be used to measure fair value are level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability we evaluate security specific market data when determining whether market is active level observable input other than level price such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price in le active market or model derived valuation all significant input used in our valuation such discounted cash flow are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability we use libor based yield curve overnight indexed swap curve currency spot and forward rate and credit rating significant input in our valuation level input also include non binding market consensus price well quoted price that were adjusted for security specific restriction when we use non binding market consensus price we corroborate them with quoted market price for similar instrument or compare them to output from internally developed pricing model such discounted cash flow model level unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of asset or liability we monitor and review the input and result of these valuation model to help ensure the fair value measurement are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset class level input also include non binding market consensus price or non binding broker quote that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data debt investmentswe consider all highly liquid debt investment with original maturity from the date of purchase of three month or le cash equivalent cash equivalent can include investment such corporate debt financial institution instrument government debt and reverse repurchase agreement marketable debt investment are generally designated trading asset when market risk is economically hedged at inception with related derivative instrument or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement investment designated trading asset are reported at fair value gain or loss on these investment arising from change in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuation and credit market volatility largely offset by loss or gain on the related derivative instrument and balance sheet remeasurement are recorded in interest and other net financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsmarketable debt investment are considered available for sale investment when the interest rate and foreign currency risk are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criterion for designation trading asset are not met available for sale debt investment with original maturity of approximately three month or le from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalent available for sale debt investment with original maturity at the date of purchase greater than approximately three month and remaining maturity of le than one year are classified short term investment available for sale debt investment with remaining maturity beyond one year are classified other long term investment available for sale debt investment are reported at fair value with unrealized gain or loss net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gain or loss on the sale of these investment in interest and other net our available for sale debt investment are subject to periodic impairment review for investment in an unrealized loss position we determine whether credit loss exists by considering information about the collectability of the instrument current market condition and reasonable and supportable forecast of economic condition we recognize an allowance for credit loss up to the amount of the unrealized loss when appropriate and write down the amortized cost basis of the investment if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the investment before recovery of it amortized cost basis allowance for credit loss and write down are recognized in interest and other net and unrealized loss not related to credit loss are recognized in other comprehensive income loss equity investmentswe regularly invest in equity security of public and private company to promote business and strategic objective equity investment are measured and recorded follows marketable equity security are equity security with rdfv that are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis with change in fair value whether realized or unrealized recorded through the income statement non marketable equity security are equity security without rdfv that are measured and recorded using measurement alternative that measure the security at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from qualifying observable price change equity method investment are equity security in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence equity method investment are measured at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investment is recognized on one quarter lag realized and unrealized gain and loss resulting from change in fair value or the sale of our equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net the carrying value of our non marketable equity security is adjusted for qualifying observable price change resulting from the issuance of similar or identical security in an orderly transaction by the same issuer determining whether an observed transaction is similar to security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the right and preference of the security recording upward and downward adjustment to the carrying value of our equity security result of observable price change requires quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security using various valuation methodology and involves the use of estimate non marketable equity security and equity method investment collectively referred to non marketable equity investment are also subject to periodic impairment review our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant impact on the investee fair value qualitative factor considered include the investee financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance market for technology operational and financing cash flow activity and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessment of the fair value of our non marketable equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others non marketable equity security are tested for impairment using qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long lived asset upon determining that an impairment may exist the security fair value is calculated and compared to it carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value equity method investment are subject to periodic impairment review using the other than temporary impairment model which considers the severity and duration of decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for sufficient period of time to allow for recovery impairment of equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsderivative financial instrumentsour primary objective for holding derivative financial instrument is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty we also enter into collateral security arrangement with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instrument fluctuates from contractually established threshold for presentation on our consolidated balance sheet we do not offset fair value amount recognized for derivative instrument under master netting arrangement our derivative financial instrument including related collateral

into earnings in the same period or period in which the hedged transaction affect earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statement of income the impact of the hedge transaction for foreign currency contract hedging our capital purchase forward point are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment and are recognized in earnings in the same income statement line item used to present the earnings effect of the hedged item if the cash flow hedge transaction become improbable the corresponding amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss would be immediately reclassified to interest and other net these derivative are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow in the same section the underlying item fair value hedge use interest rate contract such interest rate swap to hedge against change in the fair value on certain of our fixed rate indebtedness attributable to change in the benchmark interest rate the gain or loss on these hedge well the offsetting loss or gain related to the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period primarily in interest and other net these derivative are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow in the same section the underlying item primarily within cash flow from financing activity non designated hedge use foreign currency contract to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flow of recognized monetary asset and liability non dollar denominated debt instrument classified trading asset and non dollar denominated loan receivables recognized at fair value we also use interest rate contract to hedge interest rate risk related to our dollar denominated fixed rate debt instrument classified trading asset the change in fair value of these derivative is recorded through earnings in the line item on the consolidated statement of income to which the derivative most closely relate primarily in interest and other net change in the fair value of the underlying asset and liability associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the change in the fair value of the related derivative loan receivablewe elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with related derivative instrument when the fair value option is not elected the loan are carried at amortized cost we measure interest income for all loan receivable using the interest method which is based on the effective yield of the loan rather than the stated coupon rate we classify our loan within other current and long term asset credit riskfinancial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist principally of investment in debt instrument derivative financial instrument loan receivable reverse repurchase agreement and trade receivables we generally place investment with high credit quality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty relative credit standing required per our investment policy substantially all of our investment in debt instrument and financing receivables are in investment grade instrument credit rating criterion for derivative instrument are similar to those for other investment we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty due to master netting arrangement the amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instrument are generally limited to the amount if any by which the counterparty obligation exceed our obligation with that counterparty of december our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding money market fund invested in treasury and agency security and reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by treasury and agency security did not exceed billion to further reduce credit risk we enter into collateral security arrangement with certain of our derivative counterparties and obtain and secure collateral from counterparties against obligation including security lending transaction when we deem it appropriate cash collateral exchanged under our collateral security arrangement are included in other current asset other long term asset other accrued liability or other long term liability for reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by other security we do not record the collateral an asset or liability unless the collateral is repledged financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsa substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sale to oems and odms we also have account receivable derived from sale to industrial and communication equipment manufacturer in the computing and communication industry we believe the net account receivable balance from our three largest customer of december do not represent significant credit risk based on cash flow forecast balance sheet analysis and past collection experience we have adopted credit policy and standard intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe credit risk are moderated by the financial stability of our major customer we ass credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limit and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection device such obtaining parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance business combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition this allocation involves number of assumption estimate and judgment in determining the fair value of the following intangible asset including the valuation methodology estimation of future cash flow discount rate market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share well the estimated useful life of intangible asset deferred tax asset and liability uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance which are initially estimated of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment pre existing liability or legal claim deferred revenue and contingent consideration each may be applicable and goodwill measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed our assumption and estimate are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired company we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination goodwillwe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment the reporting unit carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash investment and debt qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit additionally part of this assessment we may perform quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factor above by applying sensitivity to assumption and input used in measuring reporting unit fair value our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value significant estimate include market segment growth rate our assumed market segment share estimated cost and discount rate based on reporting unit weighted average cost of capital we test the reasonableness of the input and outcome of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data in the current year the fair value for all of our reporting unit substantially exceeds their carrying value and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that more detailed quantitative analysis wa necessary identified intangible assetswe amortize acquisition related intangible asset that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life acquisition related in process asset represent the fair value of incomplete project that had not reached technological feasibility of the date of acquisition initially these are classified in process and are not subject to amortization once these project are completed the asset balance are transferred from in process to acquisition related developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward the asset balance relating to project that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to we perform quarterly review of significant finite lived identified intangible asset to determine whether fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable these review can be affected by various factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our forecast for specific product line employee equity incentive planswe use the straight line amortization method to recognize share based compensation expense over the service period of the award net of estimated forfeiture upon exercise cancellation forfeiture or expiration of stock option or upon vesting or forfeiture of rsus we eliminate deferred tax asset for option and rsus with multiple vesting date for each vesting period on first in first out basis if each vesting period were separate award financial statementsnotes to consolidated financial of contentsincome taxeswe compute the provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax asset and liability using the currently enacted tax rate that apply to taxable income in effect for the year in which those tax asset are expected to be realized or settled we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet recovery of portion of our deferred tax asset is affected by management plan with respect to holding or disposing of certain investment therefore such change could also affect our future provision for tax we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merit of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authority the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit within the provision for tax on the consolidated statement of income we recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in taxable income period cost we have recognized deferred income tax for local country income and withholding tax that could be incurred on distribution of certain non earnings or for outside basis difference in our subsidiary because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis difference remittance of non earnings are based on estimate and judgment of projected cash flow need well the working capital and investment requirement
