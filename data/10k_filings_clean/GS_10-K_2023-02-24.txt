and dealer investment banking firm commercial bank credit card issuer insurance company investment adviser mutual fund hedge fund private equity fund merchant bank consumer finance company and financial technology and other internet based company some of our competitor operate globally and others regionally and we compete based on number of factor including transaction execution client experience product and service innovation reputation and price we have faced and expect to continue to face pressure to retain market share by committing capital to business or transaction on term that offer return that may not be commensurate with their risk in particular corporate client seek such commitment such agreement to participate in their loan facility from financial service firm in connection with investment banking and other assignment consolidation and convergence have significantly increased the capital base and geographic reach of some of our competitor and have also hastened the globalization of the security and other financial service market result we have had to commit capital to support our international operation and to execute large global transaction to capitalize on some of our most significant opportunity we will have to compete successfully with financial institution that are larger and have more capital and that may have stronger local presence and longer operating history outside the we also compete with smaller institution that offer more targeted service such independent advisory firm some client may perceive these firm to be le susceptible to potential conflict of interest than we are and described below our ability to effectively compete with them could be affected by regulation and limitation on activity that apply to but may not apply to them number of our business are subject to intense price competition effort by our competitor to gain market share have resulted in pricing pressure in our investment banking market making consumer wealth management and asset management business for example the increasing volume of trade executed electronically through the internet and through alternative trading system ha increased the pressure on trading commission in that commission for electronic trading are generally lower than those for non electronic trading it appears that this trend toward low commission trading will continue price competition ha also led to compression in the difference between the price at which market participant is willing to sell an instrument and the price at which another market participant is willing to buy it bid offer spread which ha affected our market making business the increasing prevalence of passive investment strategy that typically have lower fee than other strategy we offer ha affected the competitive and pricing dynamic for our asset management product and service in addition we believe that we will continue to experience competitive pressure in these and other area in the future some of our competitor seek to obtain market share by further reducing price and we enter into or expand our presence in market that rely more heavily on electronic trading and execution we and other bank also compete for deposit on the basis of the rate we offer increase in short term interest rate have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing we also compete on the basis of the type of financial product and client experience that we and our competitor offer in some circumstance our competitor may offer financial product that we do not offer and that our client may prefer including cryptocurrencies and other digital asset that we can not or may choose not to provide our competitor may also develop technology platform that provide better client experience the provision of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act the requirement promulgated by the basel committee on banking supervision basel committee and other financial regulation could affect our competitive position to the extent that limitation on activity increased fee and compliance cost or other regulatory requirement do not apply or do not apply equally to all of our competitor or are not implemented uniformly across different jurisdiction for example the provision of the dodd frank

practice and structure under the evolving regulatory regime described further in regulation below we also face intense competition in attracting and retaining qualified employee our ability to

affected our business have been and may in the future be adversely affected by declining asset value particularly where we have net long position receive fee based on the value of asset managed or

include position we take when we act principal to facilitate our client activity including our exchange based market making activity or commit large amount of capital to maintain position in interest rate and credit product well through our currency commodity equity and mortgage related activity in addition we invest in similar asset class substantially all of our investing and market making position and portion of our loan are marked to market on daily or other periodic basis and decline in asset value directly and promptly impact our earnings unless we have effectively hedged our exposure to those decline in certain circumstance particularly in the case of credit product including leveraged loan and private equity or other security that are not freely tradable or lack established and liquid trading market it may not be possible or economic to hedge our exposure and to the extent that we do so the hedge may be ineffective or may greatly reduce our ability to profit from increase in the value of the asset sudden decline and significant volatility in the price of asset have in the past substantially curtailed or eliminated and may in the future substantially curtail or eliminate the trading market for certain asset which may make it difficult to sell hedge or value such asset we may incur loss from time to time trading market deteriorate or cease to function including with respect to loan commitment we have made or security offering we have underwritten the inability to sell or effectively hedge asset reduces our ability to limit loss in such position and the difficulty in valuing asset ha in the past negatively affected and may in the future negatively affect our capital liquidity or leverage ratio our funding cost and our ability to deploy capital in our exchange based market making activity we are obligated by stock exchange rule to maintain an orderly market including by purchasing security in declining market in market where asset value are declining and in volatile market this result in loss and an increased need for liquidity we receive asset based management fee based on the value of our client portfolio or investment in fund managed by and in some case we also receive incentive fee based on increase in the value of such investment decline in asset value would ordinarily reduce the value of our client portfolio or fund asset which in turn would typically reduce the fee we earn for managing such asset sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiarieswe post collateral to support our obligation and receive collateral that support the obligation of our client and counterparties when the value of the asset posted collateral or the credit rating of the party posting collateral decline the party posting the collateral may need to provide additional collateral or if possible reduce it trading position an example of such situation is margin call in connection with brokerage account therefore decline in the value of asset class used collateral mean that either the cost of funding position is increased or the size of position is decreased if we are the party providing collateral this can increase our cost and reduce our profitability and if we are the party receiving collateral this can also reduce our profitability by reducing the level of business done with our client and counterparties in addition volatile or le liquid market increase the difficulty of valuing asset which can lead to costly and time consuming dispute over asset value and the level of required collateral well increased credit risk to the recipient of the collateral due to delay in receiving adequate collateral in case where we foreclose on collateral sudden decline in the value or liquidity of the collateral have in the past resulted in and may in the future despite credit monitoring over collateralization the ability to call for additional collateral or the ability to force repayment of the underlying obligation result in significant loss to especially where there is single type of collateral supporting the obligation in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to claim that the foreclosure wa not permitted under the legal document wa conducted in an improper manner including in violation of law or caused client or counterparty to go out of business our market making activity have been and may in the future be affected by change in the level of market volatility certain of our market making activity depend on market volatility to provide trading and arbitrage opportunity to our client and decrease in volatility have reduced and may in the future reduce these opportunity and the level of client activity associated with them and adversely affect the result of these activity increased volatility while it can increase trading volume and spread also increase risk measured by value at risk var and may expose to increased risk in connection with our market making activity or may cause to reduce our inventory in order to avoid increasing our var limiting the size of our market making position can adversely affect our profitability in period when volatility is increasing but asset value are declining significantly it may not be possible to sell asset at all or it may only be possible to do so at steep discount in those circumstance we have been and may in the future be forced to either take on additional risk or to realize loss in order to decrease our var in addition increase in volatility increase the level of our rwas which increase our capital requirement our investment banking client intermediation asset management and wealth management business have been adversely affected and may in the future be adversely affected by market uncertainty or lack of confidence among investor and ceo due to decline in economic activity and other unfavorable economic geopolitical or market condition our investment banking business ha been and may in the future be

resulting in significant industry wide decline in the size and number of underwritings and of advisory transaction which would likely have an adverse effect on our revenue and our profit margin in particular because significant portion of our investment banking revenue is derived from our participation in large transaction decline in the number of large transaction ha in the past and would in the future adversely affect our investment banking business similarly in recent year cross border initial public offering and other security offering have accounted for significant proportion of new issuance activity legislative regulatory or other change that limit trading in or the issuance of security outside the issuer domestic market that result in or could result in the delisting or removal of security from exchange or index have in the past adversely affected and would in the future adversely affect our underwriting and client intermediation business furthermore change or proposed change to international trade and investment policy of the and other country could negatively affect market activity level and our revenue in certain circumstance market uncertainty or general decline in market or economic activity may adversely affect our client intermediation business by decreasing level of overall activity or by decreasing volatility but at other time market uncertainty and even declining economic activity may result in higher trading volume or higher spread or both market uncertainty volatility and adverse economic condition well decline in asset value may cause our client to transfer their asset out of our fund or other product or their brokerage account and result in reduced net revenue principally in our asset management and wealth management business even if client

generate lower fee poor investment return in our asset management and wealth management business due to either general market condition or underperformance relative to our competitor or to benchmark by fund or account that we manage or investment product that we design or sell affect our ability to retain existing asset and to attract new client or additional asset from existing client this could affect the management and incentive fee that we earn on au or the commission and net spread that we earn for selling other investment product such structured note or derivative to the extent that our client choose to invest in product that we do not currently offer we will suffer outflow and loss of management fee further if due to change in investor sentiment or the relative performance of certain asset class or otherwise client continue to invest in product that generate lower fee passively managed or fixed income product our average effective management fee would continue to decline and our asset management and wealth management business could be adversely affected inflation ha had and could continue to have negative effect on our business result of operation and financial condition inflationary pressure have affected economy financial market and market participant worldwide inflationary pressure have increased certain of our operating expense and have adversely affected consumer sentiment and ceo confidence central bank response to inflationary pressure have also resulted in higher market interest rate which in turn have contributed to lower activity level across financial market in particular for debt underwriting transaction and mortgage origination and resulted in lower value for certain financial asset which have adversely affected our equity and debt investment higher interest rate increase our borrowing cost and have required to increase interest paid on our deposit if inflationary pressure persist our expense may increase further we may be unable to achieve our efficiency ratio target activity level for certain of our business in particular debt underwriting and mortgage may remain at low level or decline further our interest expense could increase faster than our interest income reducing our net interest income and net interest margin certain of our investment could continue to incur loss or generally low level of return au could decline reducing management and other fee economy worldwide could experience recession and we could continue to operate in generally unfavorable economic and market environment liquidityour liquidity profitability and business may be adversely affected by an inability to access the debt capital market or to sell asset liquidity is essential to our business it is of critical importance to most of the failure of financial institution have occurred in large part due to insufficient liquidity our liquidity may be impaired by an inability to access secured and or unsecured debt market an inability to raise or retain deposit an inability to access fund from our subsidiary or otherwise allocate liquidity optimally an inability to sell asset or redeem our investment lack of timely settlement of transaction unusual deposit outflow or other unforeseen outflow of cash or collateral such in march when corporate client drew on revolving credit facility in response to the covid pandemic this situation may arise due to circumstance that we may be unable to control such general market or economic disruption or an operational problem that affect third party or or even by the perception among market participant that we or other market participant are experiencing greater liquidity risk we employ structured product to benefit our client and hedge our own risk the financial instrument that we hold and the contract to which we are party are often complex and these complex structured product often do not have readily available market to access in time of liquidity stress our investing and financing activity may lead to situation where the holding from these activity represent significant portion of specific market which could restrict liquidity for our position further our ability to sell asset may be impaired if there is not generally liquid market for such asset well in circumstance where other market participant are seeking to sell similar otherwise generally liquid asset at the same time is likely to occur in liquidity or other market crisis or in response to change to rule or regulation for example in an investment management firm with large position with several financial institution defaulted resulting in rapidly declining price in the security underlying those position in addition clearinghouses exchange and other financial institution with which we interact may exercise set off right or the right to require additional collateral including in difficult market condition which could further impair our liquidity numerous regulation have been adopted that impose more stringent liquidity requirement on large financial institution including these regulation require to hold large amount of highly liquid asset and reduce our flexibility to source and deploy funding in addition our need to manage our operation in light of certain regulatory requirement when applicable threshold are met ha in the past limited and may in the future limit our ability to raise deposit in gsib or other funding which could adversely affect our liquidity or ability to respond efficiently to liquidity stress sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesour business have been and may in the future be adversely affected by disruption or lack of liquidity in the credit market including reduced access to credit and higher cost of obtaining credit widening credit spread well significant decline in the availability of credit have in the past adversely affected our ability to borrow on secured and unsecured basis and may do so in the future we fund ourselves on an unsecured basis by issuing long term debt and commercial paper by raising deposit at our bank subsidiary by issuing hybrid financial instrument and by obtaining loan or line of credit from commercial or other banking entity we seek to finance many of our asset on secured basis any disruption in the credit market may make it harder and more expensive to obtain funding for our business if our available funding is limited or we are forced to fund our operation at higher cost these condition may require to curtail our business activity and increase our cost of funding both of which could reduce our profitability particularly in our business that involve investing lending and market making our client engaging in merger acquisition and other type of strategic transaction often rely on access to the secured and unsecured credit market to finance their transaction lack of available credit or an increased cost of credit can adversely affect the size volume and timing of

regulator legislative body and law enforcement agency with respect to matter relating to compensation our business practice our past action and other matter remains at high level political and public sentiment regarding financial institution ha in the past resulted and may in the future result in significant amount of adverse press coverage well adverse statement or charge by regulator or other government official press coverage and other public statement that assert some form of wrongdoing including in some case press coverage and public statement that do not directly involve often result in some type of investigation by regulator legislator and law enforcement official or in lawsuit responding to these investigation and lawsuit regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding is time consuming and expensive and can divert the time and effort of our senior management from our business penalty and fine sought by regulatory authority have increased substantially and certain regulator have been more likely in recent year to commence enforcement action or to support legislation targeted at the financial service industry governmental authority may also be more likely to pursue criminal or other action including seeking admission of wrongdoing or guilty plea in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation to the extent company is viewed having previously engaged in criminal regulatory or other misconduct adverse publicity governmental scrutiny and legal and enforcement proceeding can also have negative impact on our reputation and on the

by consumer and client increase in market downturn and employment related claim increase following period in which we have reduced our headcount additionally governmental entity have been plaintiff and are party in certain of our legal proceeding and we may face future civil or criminal action or claim by the same or other governmental entity well follow on civil litigation that is often commenced after regulatory settlement significant settlement by several large financial institution including in some case with governmental entity have been publicly announced the trend of large settlement with governmental entity may adversely affect the outcome for other financial institution including in some case in similar action especially where governmental official have announced that the large settlement will be used the basis or template for other settlement the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment make it difficult to estimate probable loss which can lead to substantial disparity between legal reserve and subsequent actual settlement or penalty claim of collusion or anti competitive conduct have become more common financial institution including have been subject to civil case and investigatory demand relating to alleged bid rigging group boycott or other anti competitive practice antitrust law generally provide for joint and several liability and treble damage these claim have resulted in significant settlement and fine in the past and may do so in the future we are subject to law and regulation worldwide including the fcpa and the bribery act relating to corrupt and illegal payment to and hiring practice with regard to government official and others violation of these or similar law and regulation have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in significant monetary penalty such violation could also result in severe restriction on our activity and damage to our reputation sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariescertain law enforcement authority have recently required admission of wrongdoing and in some case criminal plea part of the resolution of matter brought against financial institution or their employee see for example related matter in note to the consolidated financial statement in part ii item of this form any such resolution of criminal matter involving or our employee could lead to increased exposure to civil litigation could adversely affect our reputation could result in penalty or limitation on our ability to conduct our activity generally or in certain circumstance and could have other negative effect further result of this type of settlement we are no longer well known seasoned issuer which place limitation on the manner in which we can market our security in conducting our business around the world we are subject to political legal regulatory and other risk that are inherent in operating in many country in conducting our business and supporting our global operation we are subject to risk of possible nationalization expropriation price control capital control exchange control communication and other content restriction and other restrictive governmental action for example sanction have been imposed by the and the on certain individual and company in russia and venezuela in many country the law and regulation applicable to the security and financial service industry and many of the transaction in which we are involved are uncertain and evolving and it may be difficult for to determine the exact requirement of local law in every market we have been in some case subject to divergent and conflicting law and regulation across market and we are increasingly subject to the risk that the jurisdiction in which we operate have implemented or may implement law and regulation that directly conflict with those of another jurisdiction any determination by local regulator that we have not acted in compliance with the application of local law in particular market or our failure to develop effective working relationship with local regulator could have significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally further in some jurisdiction failure or alleged failure to comply with law and regulation ha subjected and may in the future subject and our personnel not only to civil action but also criminal action and other sanction we are also subject to the enhanced risk that transaction we structure might not be legally enforceable in all case while business and other practice throughout the world differ our principal entity are subject in their operation worldwide to rule and regulation relating to corrupt and illegal payment hiring practice and money laundering well law relating to doing business with certain individual group and country such the fcpa the bsa and the bribery act while we have invested and continue to invest significant resource in training and in compliance monitoring the geographical diversity of our operation employee client and consumer well the vendor and other third party that we deal with greatly increase the risk that we may be found in violation of such rule or regulation and any such violation could subject to significant penalty or adversely affect our reputation see for example related matter in note to the consolidated financial statement in part ii item of this form in addition there have been number of highly publicized case around the world involving actual or alleged fraud or other misconduct by employee in the financial service industry and we have had and may in the future have employee misconduct this misconduct ha included and may also in the future include intentional effort to ignore or circumvent applicable policy rule or procedure or misappropriation of fund and the theft of proprietary information including proprietary software it is not always possible to deter or prevent employee misconduct and the precaution we take to prevent and detect this activity have not been and may not be effective in all case reflected by the settlement relating to goldman sachs form goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesthe application of regulatory strategy and requirement in the and non jurisdiction to facilitate the orderly resolution of large financial institution could create greater risk of loss for group inc security holder described in business regulation banking supervision and regulation insolvency of an idi or bhc if the fdic is appointed receiver under ola the right of group inc creditor would be determined under ola and substantial difference exist in the right of creditor between ola and the bankruptcy code including the right of the fdic under ola to disregard the strict priority of creditor claim in some circumstance which could have material adverse effect on our debtholders the fdic ha announced that single point of entry strategy may be desirable strategy under ola to resolve large financial institution in manner that would among other thing impose loss on shareholder debtholders and other creditor of the top tier bhc in our case group inc while the bhc subsidiary may continue to operate it is possible that the application of the single point of entry strategy under ola in which group inc would be the only entity to enter resolution proceeding and it material broker dealer bank and other operating entity would not enter resolution proceeding would result in greater loss to group inc security holder including holder of our fixed rate floating rate and indexed debt security than the loss that would result from the application of bankruptcy proceeding or different resolution strategy such multiple point of entry resolution strategy for group inc and certain of it material subsidiary assuming group inc entered resolution proceeding and that support from group inc or other available resource to it subsidiary wa sufficient to enable the subsidiary to remain solvent loss at the subsidiary level would be transferred to group inc and ultimately borne by group inc security holder third party creditor of group inc subsidiary would receive full recovery on their claim and group inc security holder including our shareholder debtholders and other unsecured creditor could face significant and possibly complete loss in that case group inc security holder would face loss while the third party creditor of group inc subsidiary would incur no loss because the subsidiary would continue to operate and would not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceeding in addition holder of group inc eligible long term debt and holder of group inc other debt security could face loss ahead of it other similarly situated creditor in resolution under ola if the fdic exercised it right described above to disregard the priority of creditor claim ola also provides the fdic with authority to cause creditor and shareholder of the financial company in receivership to bear loss before taxpayer are exposed to such loss and amount owed to the government would generally receive statutory payment priority over the claim of private creditor including senior creditor in addition under ola claim of creditor including debtholders could be satisfied through the issuance of equity or other security in bridge entity to which group inc asset are transferred if such security for claim exchange were implemented there can be no assurance that the value of the security of the bridge entity would be sufficient to repay or satisfy all or any part of the creditor claim for which the security were exchanged while the fdic ha issued regulation to implement ola not all aspect of how the fdic might exercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is possible in addition certain jurisdiction including the and the have implemented resolution regime to provide resolution authority with the ability to recapitalize failing entity by writing down it unsecured debt or converting it unsecured debt into equity such bail in power are intended to enable the recapitalization of failing institution by allocating loss to it shareholder and unsecured debtholders for example the bank of england requires certain amount of intercompany funding that we provide to our material subsidiary to contain contractual trigger to expressly permit the bank of england to exercise such bail in power in certain circumstance if the intercompany funding we provide to our subsidiary is bailed in group inc claim on it subsidiary would be subordinated to the claim of the subsidiary third party creditor or written down regulator are considering and non authority have adopted requirement that certain subsidiary of large financial institution maintain minimum amount of total loss absorbing capacity that would pas loss up from the subsidiary to the top tier bhc and ultimately to security holder of the top tier bhc in the event of failure sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesthe application of group inc proposed resolution strategy could result in greater loss for group inc security holder in our resolution plan group inc would be resolved under the bankruptcy code the strategy described in our resolution plan is variant of the single point of entry strategy group inc and goldman sachs funding llc funding ihc wholly owned direct subsidiary of group inc would recapitalize and provide liquidity to certain major subsidiary including through the forgiveness of intercompany indebtedness the extension of the maturity of intercompany indebtedness and the extension of additional intercompany loan if this strategy were successful creditor of some or all of group inc major subsidiary would receive full recovery on their claim while group inc security holder could face significant and possibly complete loss to facilitate the execution of our resolution plan we formed funding ihc in exchange for an unsecured subordinated funding note and equity interest group inc transferred certain intercompany receivables and substantially all of it gcla to funding ihc and agreed to transfer additional gcla above prescribed threshold we also put in place capital and liquidity support agreement clsa among group inc funding ihc and our major subsidiary under the clsa funding ihc ha provided group inc with committed line of credit that allows group inc to draw sufficient fund to meet it cash need during the ordinary course of business in addition if our financial resource deteriorate so severely that resolution may be imminent the committed line of credit will automatically terminate and the unsecured subordinated funding note will automatically be forgiven ii all intercompany receivables owed by the major subsidiary to group inc will be transferred to funding ihc or their maturity will be extended to five year iii group inc will be obligated to transfer substantially all of it remaining intercompany receivables and gcla other than an amount to fund anticipated bankruptcy expense to funding ihc and iv funding ihc will be obligated to provide capital and liquidity support to the major subsidiary group inc and funding ihc obligation under the clsa are secured pursuant to related security agreement such action would materially and adversely affect group inc liquidity result during period of severe stress group inc might commence bankruptcy proceeding at an earlier time than it otherwise would if the clsa and related security agreement had not been implemented if group inc proposed resolution strategy were successful group inc security holder could face loss while the third party creditor of group inc major subsidiary would incur no loss because those subsidiary would continue to operate and not enter resolution or bankruptcy proceeding part of the strategy group inc could also seek to elevate the priority of it guarantee obligation relating to it major subsidiary derivative contract or transfer them to another entity so that cross default and early termination right would be stayed under the isda protocol applicable which would result in holder of group inc eligible long term debt and holder of group inc other debt security incurring loss ahead of the beneficiary of those guarantee obligation it is also possible that holder of group inc eligible long term debt and other debt security could incur loss ahead of other similarly situated creditor of group inc major subsidiary if group inc proposed resolution strategy were not successful group inc financial condition would be adversely impacted and group inc security holder including debtholders may consequence be in worse position than if the strategy had not been implemented in all case any payment to debtholders are dependent on our ability to make such payment and are therefore subject to our credit risk result of our recovery and resolution planning process including incorporating feedback from our regulator we may incur increased operational funding or other cost and face limitation on our ability to structure our internal organization or engage in internal or external activity in manner that we may otherwise deem most operationally efficient our commodity activity particularly our physical commodity activity subject to extensive regulation and involve certain potential risk including environmental reputational and other risk that may expose to significant liability and cost part of our commodity business we purchase and sell certain physical commodity arrange for their storage and transport and engage in market making of commodity the commodity involved in these activity may include crude oil refined oil product natural gas liquefied natural gas electric power agricultural product metal base and precious mineral including unenriched uranium emission credit coal freight and related product and index we make investment in and finance entity

environmental law and regulation relating to among others air quality water quality waste management transportation of hazardous substance natural resource site remediation and health and safety additionally rising climate change concern have led to additional regulation that could increase the operating cost and adversely affect the profitability of certain of our investment there may be substantial cost in complying with current or future law and regulation relating to our commodity related activity and investment compliance with these law and regulation could require significant commitment of capital toward environmental monitoring renovation of storage facility or transport vessel payment of emission fee and carbon or other tax and application for and holding of permit and license commodity involved in our intermediation activity and investment are also subject to the risk of unforeseen or catastrophic event which are likely to be outside of our control including those arising from the breakdown or failure of transport vessel storage facility or other equipment or process or other mechanical malfunction fire leak spill or release of hazardous substance performance below expected level of output or efficiency terrorist attack extreme weather event or other natural disaster or other hostile or catastrophic event in addition we rely on third party supplier or service provider to perform their contractual obligation and any failure on their part including the failure to obtain raw material at reasonable price or to safely transport or store commodity could expose to cost or loss also while we seek to insure against potential risk we may not be able to obtain insurance to cover some of these risk and the insurance that we have may be inadequate to cover our loss the occurrence of any of such event may prevent from performing under our agreement with client may impair our operation or financial result and may result in litigation regulatory action negative publicity or other reputational harm we may also be required to divest or discontinue certain of these activity for regulatory or legal reason or due to the transition to le carbon dependent economy in response to climate change competitionour result have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the composition of our client base our client base is not the same that of our major competitor our business may have higher or lower percentage of client in certain industry or market than some or all of our competitor therefore unfavorable industry development or market condition affecting certain industry or market have resulted in the past and may result in the future in our business underperforming relative to similar business of competitor if our business have higher concentration of client in such industry or market for example our market making business have higher percentage of client with actively managed asset than some of our competitor and such client have in the past been and may in the future be disproportionately affected by low volatility correspondingly favorable or simply le adverse development or market condition involving industry or market in business where we have lower concentration of client in such industry or market have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in our underperforming relative to similar business of competitor that ha higher concentration of client in such industry or market for example we have smaller corporate client base in our market making business than some of our peer and therefore those competitor may benefit more from increased activity by corporate client similarly we have not historically engaged in retail equity intermediation to the same extent other financial institution which ha in the past affected and could in the future adversely affect our market share in equity execution the financial service industry is highly competitive the financial service industry and all of our business are intensely competitive and we expect them to remain so we compete on the basis of number of factor including transaction execution our product and service innovation reputation creditworthiness and price there ha been substantial consolidation and convergence among company in the financial service industry this ha hastened the globalization of the security and other financial service market result we have had to commit capital to support our international operation and to execute large global transaction we have expanded into new business area and new geographic region we have faced competitor with more experience and more established relationship with client regulator and industry participant in the relevant market which could adversely affect our ability to expand our business sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesgovernments and regulator have adopted regulation imposed tax adopted compensation restriction or otherwise put forward various proposal that have impacted or may impact our ability to conduct certain of our business in cost effective manner or at all in certain or all jurisdiction including proposal relating to restriction on the type of activity in which financial institution are permitted to engage these or other similar rule many of which do not apply to all our or non competitor could impact our ability to compete effectively pricing and other competitive pressure in our business have continued to increase particularly in situation where some of our competitor may seek to increase market share by reducing price for example in connection with investment banking and other assignment in response to competitive pressure we have experienced we have extended and priced credit at level that in some case have not fully compensated for the risk we undertook the financial service industry is highly interrelated in that significant volume of transaction occur among limited number of member of that industry many transaction are syndicated to other financial institution and financial institution are often counterparties in transaction this ha led to claim by other market participant and regulator that such institution have colluded in order to manipulate market or market price including allegation that antitrust law have been violated while we have extensive procedure and control that are designed to identify and prevent such activity they may not be effective allegation of such activity particularly by regulator can have negative reputational impact and can subject to large fine and settlement and potentially significant penalty including treble damage the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new product and technology including trading and distributed ledger technology including cryptocurrencies ha increased competition technology is fundamental to our business and our industry the growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technology is changing our business and presenting with new challenge security future and option transaction are increasingly occurring electronically both on our own system and through other alternative trading system and it appears that the trend toward alternative trading system will continue some of these alternative trading system compete with particularly our exchange based market making activity and we may experience continued competitive pressure in these and other area in addition the increased use by our client of low cost electronic trading system and direct electronic access to trading market could cause reduction in commission and spread our client increasingly use our system to trade directly in the market we may incur liability result of their use of our order routing and execution infrastructure we have invested significant resource into the development of electronic trading system and expect to continue to do so but there is no assurance that the revenue generated by these system will yield an adequate return particularly given the generally lower commission arising from electronic trade in addition the emergence adoption and evolution of new technology including distributed ledger such digital asset and blockchain have required to invest resource to adapt our existing product and service and we expect to continue to make such investment which could be material the adoption and evolution of such new technology may also increase our compliance and regulatory cost further technology such those based on distributed ledger that do not require intermediation could also significantly disrupt payment processing and other financial service regulatory limitation on our involvement in product and platform involving digital asset and distributed ledger technology may not apply equally or in some case at all to certain of our competitor we may not be timely or successful in developing or integrating or even able to develop or integrate new product and technology such those built on distributed ledger into our existing product and service adapting to change in consumer preference or achieving market acceptance of our product and service any of which could affect our ability to attract or retain client cause to lose market share or result in service disruption and in turn reduce our revenue or otherwise adversely affect our business would be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employee our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled people therefore our continued ability to compete effectively in our business to manage our business effectively and to expand into new business and geographic area depends on our ability to attract new talented and diverse employee and to retain and motivate our existing employee factor that affect our ability to attract and retain such employee include the level and composition of our compensation and benefit and our reputation successful business with culture of fairly hiring training and promoting qualified employee significant portion of the compensation that we pay to our employee is in the form of year end discretionary compensation significant portion of which is in the form of deferred equity related award decline in our profitability or in the outlook for our future profitability well regulatory limitation on compensation level and term can negatively impact our ability to hire and retain highly qualified employee goldman sachs form goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariescompetition from within the financial service industry and from business outside the financial service industry including the technology industry for qualified employee ha often been intense we have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employee to address the demand of our expanding consumer oriented business and our technology initiative this is also the case in emerging and growth market where we are often competing for qualified employee with entity that have significantly greater presence or more extensive experience in the region law or regulation in jurisdiction in which our operation are located that affect tax on our employee income or the amount or composition of compensation or that require to disclose our or our competitor compensation practice may also adversely affect our ability to hire and retain qualified employee in those jurisdiction described further in business regulation compensation practice in part item of this form our compensation practice are subject to review by and the standard of the frb large global financial and banking institution we are subject to limitation on compensation practice which may or may not affect the company with which we compete for talent by the frb the pra the fca the fdic and other regulator worldwide these limitation have shaped our compensation practice which ha in some case adversely affected our ability to attract and retain talented employee in particular in relation to company not subject to these limitation and future legislation or regulation may have similar adverse effect our operating expense and efficiency ratio depend in part on our overall headcount and the proportion of our employee located in strategic location our future human capital resource requirement and the benefit provided by strategic location are uncertain and we may not realize the benefit we anticipate market development and general business environmentour business financial

result of operation the extent to which the covid pandemic will negatively affect our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation will depend on among other thing future development including any resurgence of covid case the emergence of new variant of covid and the effectiveness of vaccine and treatment over the long term and against new variant which are highly uncertain and can not be predicted climate change could disrupt our business and adversely affect client activity level and the creditworthiness of our client and counterparties and our effort to address concern relating to climate change could result in damage to our reputation climate change may cause extreme weather event that disrupt operation at one or more of our primary location which may negatively affect our ability to service and interact with our client adversely affect the value of our investment including our real estate investment and reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance climate change and the transition to le carbon dependent economy may also have negative impact on the operation or financial condition of our client and counterparties which may decrease revenue from those client and counterparties and increase the credit risk associated with loan and other credit exposure to those client and counterparties in addition climate change may impact the broader economy sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiarieswe are also exposed to risk resulting from change in public policy law and regulation or market and public perception and preference in connection with the transition to le carbon dependent economy these change could adversely affect our business result of operation and reputation for example our reputation and client relationship may be damaged result of our or our client involvement in or decision not to participate in certain industry or project associated with causing or exacerbating climate change well any decision we make to continue to conduct or change our activity in response to consideration relating to climate change if we are unable to achieve our objective relating to climate change or our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective insufficient or otherwise inappropriate our business reputation and effort to recruit and retain employee may suffer new regulation or guidance relating to climate change well the perspective of government official regulator shareholder employee and other stakeholder regarding climate change may affect whether and on what term and condition we engage in certain activity or offer certain product federal and state and non banking regulator and supervisory authority shareholder and other stakeholder have increasingly viewed financial institution playing an important role in helping to address risk related to climate change both directly and with respect to their client which may result in financial institution coming under increased requirement and expectation regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risk and related lending investment and advisory activity the frb ha announced that we are among the six financial institution participating in pilot climate scenario analysis exercise in and we also are subject to new or heightened regulatory requirement relating to climate change such requirement relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenario any such new or heightened requirement could result in increased regulatory compliance or other cost or higher capital requirement the risk associated with and the perspective of regulator shareholder employee and other stakeholder regarding climate change are continuing to evolve rapidly which can make it difficult to ass the ultimate impact on of climate change related risk and uncertainty and we expect that climate change related risk will increase over time our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation may be adversely affected by disruption in the global economy caused by russia invasion of ukraine and related sanction and other development the war between russia and ukraine ha negatively affected the global economy government around the world have responded to russia invasion by imposing economic sanction and export control on certain industry sector including price cap on russian oil and party in russia compliance with economic sanction and restriction imposed by government ha increased our cost and otherwise adversely affected our business and may continue to do so russia ha responded with it own restriction against investor and country outside russia and ha proposed additional measure aimed at non russia owned business business in the and globally have experienced shortage in material and increased cost for transportation energy and raw material due in part to the negative effect of the war on the global economy the escalation or continuation of the war between russia and ukraine or other hostility could result in among other thing further increased risk of cyber attack an increased frequency and volume of failure to settle security transaction supply chain disruption higher inflation lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity currency and other financial market the extent and duration

trend to continue various emerging and growth market country have experienced severe economic and financial disruption including significant devaluation of their currency default or threatened default on sovereign debt capital and currency exchange control and low or negative growth rate in their economy the possible effect of any of these condition include an adverse impact on our business and

acquisition and expect to continue to do so if and to the extent we are unable to successfully execute those initiative we may incur unanticipated cost and loss and face other adverse consequence such negative reputational effect in addition the actual effect of pursuing those initiative may differ possibly materially from the benefit that we expect to realize from them such generating additional revenue achieving expense saving reducing operational risk exposure or using capital and funding more efficiently engaging in new activity expose to variety of risk including that we may be unable to successfully develop new competitive efficient and effective system and process and hire and retain the necessary personnel due to our lack of historical experience with unsecured consumer lending our loan loss assumption may prove to be incorrect and we may incur loss significantly above those which we originally anticipated in entering the business or in expanding the product offering for the business in recent year we have invested and may continue to invest more in business that we expect will generate higher level of more consistent revenue in order to develop and be able to offer consumer financial product that compete effectively we have made and may continue to make significant investment in technology and human capital resource in connection with our consumer oriented activity such investment and acquisition may not be successful or have return similar to our other business we may not be able to fully realize the expected benefit or synergy from acquisition or other business initiative in the time frame we expect or at all we have engaged in selective acquisition and may continue to do so in the future and these acquisition may individually or in the aggregate be material to any future acquisition could involve the issuance of common stock and or the payment of cash consideration the success of our acquisition will depend in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergy cost saving and growth opportunity we may face numerous risk and uncertainty in combining and integrating the relevant business and system including the need to combine or separate accounting and data processing system and management control and to integrate relationship with client counterparties regulator and others in connection with acquisition integration of acquired business is time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business produce unforeseen regulatory or operating difficulty cause to incur incremental expense or require incremental financial management and other resource it is also possible that an acquisition once announced may not close due to the failure to satisfy applicable closing condition such the receipt of necessary shareholder or regulatory approval there is no assurance that any of our acquisition will be successfully integrated or yield all of the expected benefit and synergy in

liability are included in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value marked to market with related gain or loss generally recognized in our consolidated statement of earnings the use of fair value to measure financial instrument is fundamental to our risk management practice and is our most critical accounting policy the fair value of financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date we measure certain financial asset and liability portfolio based on it net exposure to market and or credit risk in determining fair value the hierarchy under generally accepted accounting principle gaap give the highest priority to unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical unrestricted asset or liability level input ii the next priority to input other than level input that are observable either directly or indirectly level input and iii the lowest priority to input that can not be observed in market activity level input in evaluating the significance of valuation input we consider among other factor portfolio net risk exposure to that input asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to their fair value measurement the fair value for substantially all of our financial asset and

evidence to the contrary instrument classified in level of the fair value hierarchy are initially valued at transaction price which is considered to be the best initial estimate of fair value subsequent to the transaction date we use other methodology to determine fair value which vary based on the type of instrument estimating the fair value of level financial instrument requires judgment to be made these judgment include determining the appropriate valuation methodology and or model for each type of level financial instrument determining model input based on an evaluation of all relevant empirical market data including price evidenced by market transaction interest rate credit spread volatility and correlation and determining appropriate valuation adjustment including those related to illiquidity or counterparty credit quality regardless of the methodology valuation input and assumption are only changed when corroborated by substantive evidence control over valuation of financial instrument market maker and investment professional in our revenue producing unit are responsible for pricing our financial instrument our control infrastructure is independent of the revenue producing unit and is fundamental to ensuring that all of our financial instrument are appropriately valued at market clearing level in the event that there is difference of opinion in situation where estimating the fair value of financial instrument requires judgment calibration to market comparables or trade comparison described below the final valuation decision is made by senior manager in independent risk oversight and control function this independent price verification is critical to ensuring that our financial instrument are properly valued goldman sachs form goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysisprice verification all financial instrument at fair value classified in level and of the fair value hierarchy are subject to our independent price verification process the objective of price verification is to have an informed and independent opinion with regard to the valuation of financial instrument under review instrument that have one or more significant input which can not be corroborated by external market data are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy price verification strategy utilized by our independent risk oversight and control function include trade comparison analysis of trade data both internal and external where available is used to determine the most relevant pricing input and valuation external price comparison valuation and price are compared to pricing data obtained from third party broker or dealer global service bloomberg ice data service pricing direct trace data obtained from various source is compared to ensure consistency and validity when broker or dealer quotation or third party pricing vendor are used for valuation or price verification greater priority is generally given to executable quotation calibration to market comparables market based transaction are used to corroborate the valuation of position with similar characteristic risk and component relative value analysis market based transaction are analyzed to determine the similarity measured in term of risk liquidity and return of one instrument relative to another or for given instrument of one maturity relative to another collateral analysis margin call on derivative are analyzed to determine implied value which are used to corroborate our valuation execution of trade where appropriate market making desk are instructed to execute trade in order to provide evidence of market clearing level backtesting valuation are corroborated by comparison to value realized upon sale see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about fair value measurement review of net revenue independent risk oversight and control function ensure adherence to our pricing policy through combination of daily procedure including the explanation and attribution of net revenue based on the underlying factor through this process we independently validate net revenue identify and resolve potential fair value or trade booking issue on timely basis and seek to ensure that risk are being properly categorized and quantified review of valuation model our independent model risk management group model risk consisting of quantitative professional who are separate from model developer performs an independent model review and validation process of our valuation model new or changed model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation model are reviewed annually to ass the impact of any change in the product or market and any market development in pricing theory see risk management model risk management for further information about the review and validation of our valuation model allowance for credit loss we estimate and record an allowance for credit loss related to our loan held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost to determine the allowance for credit loss we classify our loan accounted for at amortized cost into wholesale and consumer portfolio these portfolio represent the level at which we have developed and documented our methodology to determine the allowance for credit loss the allowance for credit loss is measured on collective basis for loan that exhibit similar risk characteristic using modeled approach and on an asset specific basis for loan that do not share similar risk characteristic the allowance for credit loss take into account the weighted average of range of forecast of future economic condition over the expected life of the loan and lending commitment the expected life of each loan or lending commitment is determined based on the contractual term adjusted for extension option or demand feature or is modeled in the case of revolving credit card loan the forecast include baseline favorable and adverse economic scenario over three year period for loan with expected life beyond three year the model reverts to historical loss information based on non linear modeled approach we apply judgment in weighting individual scenario each quarter based on variety of factor including our internally derived economic outlook market consensus recent macroeconomic condition and industry trend the forecasted economic scenario consider number of risk factor relevant to the wholesale and consumer portfolio risk factor for wholesale loan include internal credit rating industry default and loss data expected life macroeconomic indicator unemployment rate and gdp the borrower capacity to meet it financial obligation the borrower country of risk and industry loan seniority and collateral type in addition for loan backed by real estate risk factor include loan to value ratio debt service ratio and home price index risk factor for installment and credit card loan include fair isaac corporation fico credit score delinquency status loan vintage and macroeconomic indicator sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysisthe allowance for credit loss also includes qualitative component which allow management to reflect the uncertain nature of economic forecasting capture uncertainty regarding model input and account for model imprecision and concentration risk our estimate of credit loss entail judgment about collectability at the reporting date and there are uncertainty inherent in those judgment the allowance for credit loss is subject to governance process that involves review and approval by senior management within our independent risk oversight and control function personnel within our independent risk oversight and control function are responsible for forecasting the economic variable that underlie the economic scenario that are used in the modeling of expected credit loss while we use the best information available to determine this estimate future adjustment to the allowance may be necessary based on among other thing change in the economic environment or variance between actual result and the original assumption used loan are charged off against the allowance for loan loss when deemed to be uncollectible we also record an allowance for credit loss on lending commitment which are held for investment that are accounted for at amortized cost such allowance is determined using the same methodology the allowance for loan loss while also taking into consideration the probability of drawdowns or funding and whether such commitment are cancellable by to estimate the potential impact of an adverse macroeconomic environment on our allowance for credit loss we among other thing compared the expected credit loss under the weighted average forecast used in the calculation of allowance for credit loss of december which wa weighted towards the baseline and adverse economic scenario to the expected credit loss under weighted adverse economic scenario the adverse economic scenario of the forecast model reflects global recession in and more aggressive tightening of monetary policy by central bank resulting in an economic contraction and rising unemployment rate weighting to the adverse economic scenario would have resulted in an approximate billion increase in our allowance for credit loss of december this hypothetical increase doe not take into consideration any potential adjustment to qualitative reserve the forecast of macroeconomic condition are inherently uncertain and do not take into account any other offsetting or correlated effect the actual credit loss in an adverse macroeconomic environment may differ significantly from this estimate see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about the allowance for credit loss use of estimate gaap requires to make certain estimate and assumption in addition to the estimate we make in connection with fair value measurement and the allowance for credit loss on loan and lending commitment held for investment and accounted for at amortized cost the use of estimate and assumption is also important in determining the accounting for goodwill and identifiable intangible asset provision for loss that may arise from litigation and regulatory proceeding including governmental investigation and accounting for income tax goodwill is assessed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if event occur or circumstance change that indicate an impairment may exist when assessing goodwill for impairment first qualitative assessment can be made to determine whether it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value if the result of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive quantitative goodwill test is performed alternatively quantitative goodwill test can be performed without performing qualitative assessment estimating the fair value of our reporting unit requires judgment critical input to the fair value estimate include projected earnings and allocated equity there is inherent uncertainty in the projected earnings the carrying value of each reporting unit reflects an allocation of total shareholder equity and represents the estimated amount of total shareholder equity required to support the activity of the reporting unit under currently applicable regulatory capital requirement the estimated fair value of our consumer platform reporting unit which represents approximately of our goodwill wa not substantially in excess of it carrying value this reporting unit ha been adversely impacted by the recent operating environment generally characterized by broad macroeconomic concern we will continue to closely monitor it to determine whether an impairment is required in the future of december the goodwill related to the consumer platform reporting unit wa million see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about goodwill if we experience prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment financial market the performance of one or more of our reporting unit or our common stock price or additional increase in capital requirement our goodwill could be impaired in the future identifiable intangible asset are tested for impairment when event or change in circumstance suggest that an asset or asset group carrying value may not be fully recoverable judgment is required to evaluate whether indication of potential impairment have occurred and to test identifiable intangible asset for impairment if required an impairment is recognized if the estimated undiscounted cash flow relating to the asset or asset group is le than the corresponding carrying value see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about identifiable intangible asset goldman sachs form

such loss are probable and can be reasonably estimated in addition we estimate the upper end of the range of reasonably possible aggregate loss in excess of the related reserve for litigation and regulatory proceeding where we believe the risk of loss is more than slight see note and to the consolidated financial statement for information about certain judicial litigation and regulatory proceeding significant judgment is required in making these estimate and our final liability may ultimately be materially different our total estimated liability in respect of litigation and regulatory proceeding is determined on case by case basis and represents an estimate of probable loss after considering among other factor the progress of each case proceeding or investigation our experience and the experience of others in similar case proceeding or investigation and the opinion and view of legal counsel in accounting for income tax we recognize tax position in the financial

overview liquidity risk is the risk that we will be unable to fund ourselves or meet our liquidity need in the event of firm specific broader industry or market liquidity stress event we have in place comprehensive and conservative set of liquidity and funding policy our principal objective is to be able to fund ourselves and to enable our core business to continue to serve client and generate revenue even under adverse circumstance treasury which report to our chief financial officer ha primary responsibility for developing managing and executing our liquidity and funding strategy within our risk appetite liquidity risk which is independent of our revenue producing unit and treasury and report to our chief risk officer ha primary responsibility for identifying monitoring and managing our liquidity risk through firmwide oversight across our global business and the establishment of stress testing and limit framework sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysisliquidity risk management principle we manage liquidity risk according to three principle hold sufficient excess liquidity in the form of gcla to cover outflow during stressed period ii maintain appropriate asset liability management and iii maintain viable contingency funding plan gcla gcla is liquidity that we maintain to meet broad range of potential cash outflow and collateral need in stressed environment primary liquidity principle is to pre fund our estimated potential cash and collateral need during liquidity crisis and hold this liquidity in the form of unencumbered highly liquid security and cash we believe that the security held in our gcla would be readily convertible to cash in matter of day through liquidation by entering into repurchase agreement or from maturity of resale agreement and that this cash would allow to meet immediate obligation without needing to sell other asset or depend on additional funding from credit sensitive market our gcla reflects the following principle the first day or week of liquidity crisis are the most critical to company survival focus must be maintained on all potential cash and collateral outflow not disruption to financing flow our business are diverse and our liquidity need are determined by many factor including market movement collateral requirement and client commitment all of which can change dramatically in difficult funding environment during liquidity crisis credit sensitive funding including unsecured debt certain deposit and some type of secured financing agreement may be unavailable and the term interest rate collateral provision and tenor or availability of other type of secured financing may change and certain deposit may be withdrawn and result of our policy to pre fund liquidity that we estimate may be needed in crisis we hold more unencumbered security and have larger funding balance than our business would otherwise require we believe that our liquidity is stronger with greater balance of highly liquid unencumbered security even though it increase our total asset and our funding cost we maintain our gcla across group inc goldman sachs funding llc funding ihc and group inc major broker dealer and bank subsidiary asset type and clearing agent to provide with sufficient operating liquidity to ensure timely settlement in all major market even in difficult funding environment in addition to the gcla we maintain cash balance and security in several of our other entity primarily for use in specific currency entity or jurisdiction where we do not have immediate access to parent company liquidity asset liability management our liquidity risk management policy are designed to ensure we have sufficient amount of financing even when funding market experience persistent stress we manage the maturity and diversity of our funding across market product and counterparties and seek to maintain diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor taking into consideration the characteristic and liquidity profile of our asset our approach to asset liability management includes conservatively managing the overall characteristic of our funding book with focus on maintaining long term diversified source of funding in excess of our current requirement see balance sheet and funding source funding source for further information actively managing and monitoring our asset base with particular focus on the liquidity holding period and ability to fund asset on secured basis we ass our funding requirement and our ability to liquidate asset in stressed environment while appropriately managing risk this enables to determine the most appropriate funding product and tenor see balance sheet and funding source balance sheet management for further information about our balance sheet management process and funding source secured funding for further information about asset class that may be harder to fund on secured basis and raising secured and unsecured financing that ha long tenor relative to the liquidity profile of our asset this reduces the risk that our liability will come due in advance of our ability to generate liquidity from the sale of our asset because we maintain highly liquid balance sheet the holding period of certain of our asset may be materially shorter than their contractual maturity date goldman sachs form goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysisour goal is to ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our asset and meet our contractual and contingent obligation in normal time well during period of market stress through our dynamic balance sheet management process we use actual and projected asset balance to determine secured and unsecured funding requirement funding plan are reviewed and approved by the firmwide asset liability committee in addition our independent risk oversight and control function analyze and the firmwide asset liability committee review our consolidated total capital position unsecured long term borrowing plus total shareholder equity so that we maintain level of long term funding that is sufficient to meet our long term financing requirement in liquidity crisis we would first use our gcla in order to avoid reliance on asset sale other than our gcla however we recognize that orderly asset sale may be prudent or necessary in severe or persistent liquidity crisis subsidiary funding policy the majority of our unsecured funding is raised by group inc which provides the necessary fund to funding ihc and other subsidiary some of which are regulated to meet their asset financing liquidity and capital requirement in addition group inc provides it regulated subsidiary with the necessary capital to meet their regulatory requirement the benefit of this approach to subsidiary funding are enhanced control and greater flexibility to meet the funding requirement of our subsidiary funding is also raised at the subsidiary level through variety of product including deposit secured funding and unsecured borrowing our intercompany funding policy assume that subsidiary fund or security are not freely available to it parent funding ihc or other subsidiary unless legally provided for and ii there are no additional regulatory tax or other restriction in particular many of our subsidiary are subject to law that authorize regulatory body to block or reduce the flow of fund from those subsidiary to group inc or funding ihc regulatory action of that kind could impede access to fund that group inc need to make payment on it obligation accordingly we assume that the capital provided to our regulated subsidiary is not available to group inc or other subsidiary and any other financing provided to our regulated subsidiary is not available to group inc or funding ihc until the maturity of such financing group inc ha provided substantial amount of equity and subordinated indebtedness directly or indirectly to it regulated subsidiary for example of december group inc had billion of equity and subordinated indebtedness invested in co it principal registered broker dealer billion invested in gsi regulated broker dealer billion invested in gsjcl regulated japanese broker dealer billion invested in bank usa regulated new york state chartered bank and billion invested in gsib regulated bank group inc also provides financing directly or indirectly in the form of billion of unsubordinated loan including secured loan of billion and billion of collateral and cash deposit to these entity of december in addition of december group inc had significant amount of capital invested in and loan to it other regulated subsidiary contingency funding plan we maintain contingency funding plan to provide framework for analyzing and responding to liquidity crisis situation or period of market stress our contingency funding plan outline list of potential risk factor key report and metric that are reviewed on an ongoing basis to assist in assessing the severity of and managing through liquidity crisis and or market dislocation the contingency funding plan also describes in detail our potential response if our assessment indicate that we have entered liquidity crisis which include pre funding for what we estimate will be our potential cash and collateral need well utilizing secondary source of liquidity mitigants and action item to address specific risk which may arise are also described and assigned to individual responsible for execution the contingency funding plan identifies key group of individual and their responsibility which include fostering effective coordination control and distribution of information implementing liquidity maintenance activity and managing internal and external communication all of which are critical in the management of crisis or period of market stress sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysisstress test in order to determine the appropriate size of our gcla we model liquidity outflow over range of scenario and time horizon one of our primary internal liquidity risk model referred to the modeled liquidity outflow quantifies our liquidity risk over day stress scenario we also consider other factor including but not limited to an assessment of our potential intraday liquidity need through an additional internal liquidity risk model referred to the intraday liquidity model the result of our long term stress testing model our resolution liquidity model and other applicable regulatory requirement and qualitative assessment of our condition well the financial market the result of the modeled liquidity outflow the intraday liquidity model the long term stress testing model and the resolution liquidity model are reported to senior management on regular basis we also perform firmwide stress test see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress test modeled liquidity outflow our modeled liquidity outflow is based on conducting multiple scenario that include combination of market wide and firm specific stress these scenario are characterized by the following qualitative element severely challenged market environment which include low consumer and corporate confidence financial and political instability and adverse change in market value including potential decline in equity market and widening of credit spread and firm specific crisis potentially triggered by material loss reputational damage litigation and or rating downgrade the following are key modeling element of our modeled liquidity outflow liquidity need over day scenario two notch downgrade of our long term senior unsecured credit rating changing condition in funding market which limit our access to unsecured and secured funding no support from additional government funding facility although we have access to various central bank funding program we do not assume reliance on additional source of funding in liquidity crisis and combination of contractual outflow and contingent outflow arising from both our on and off balance sheet arrangement contractual outflow include among other thing upcoming maturity of unsecured debt term deposit and secured funding contingent outflow include among other thing the withdrawal of customer credit balance in our prime brokerage business increase in variation margin requirement due to adverse change in the value of our exchange traded and otc cleared derivative draw on unfunded commitment and withdrawal of deposit that have no contractual maturity see note to the consolidated financial statement for further information about contractual outflow including note for collateralized financing note for deposit note for unsecured long term borrowing and note for operating lease payment and off balance sheet arrangement for further information about our various type of off balance sheet arrangement intraday liquidity model our intraday liquidity model measure our intraday liquidity need using scenario analysis characterized by the same qualitative element our modeled liquidity outflow the model ass the risk of increased intraday liquidity requirement during scenario where access to source of intraday liquidity may become constrained long term stress testing we utilize longer term stress test to take forward view on our liquidity position through prolonged stress period in which we experience severe liquidity stress and recover in an environment that continues to be challenging we are focused on ensuring conservative asset liability management to prepare for prolonged period of potential stress seeking to maintain diversified funding profile with an appropriate tenor taking into consideration the characteristic and liquidity profile of our asset resolution liquidity model in connection with our resolution planning effort we have established our resolution liquidity adequacy and positioning framework which estimate liquidity need of our major subsidiary in stressed environment the liquidity need are measured using our modeled liquidity outflow assumption and include certain additional inter affiliate exposure we have also established our resolution liquidity execution need framework which measure the liquidity need of our major subsidiary to stabilize and wind down following group inc bankruptcy filing in accordance with our preferred resolution strategy in addition we have established trigger and alert framework which

condition well the financial market we believe our liquidity position of both december and december wa appropriate we strictly limit our gcla to narrowly defined list of security and cash because they

use single var model which capture risk including interest rate equity price currency rate and commodity price such var facilitates comparison across portfolio of different risk characteristic var also capture the diversification of aggregated risk at the firmwide level goldman sachs form goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysiswe are aware of the inherent limitation to var and therefore use variety of risk measure in our market risk management process inherent limitation to var include var doe not estimate potential loss over longer time horizon where move may be extreme var doe not take account of the relative liquidity of different risk position and previous move in market risk factor may not produce accurate prediction of all future market move to comprehensively capture our exposure and relevant risk in our var calculation we use historical simulation with full valuation of market factor at the position level by simultaneously shocking the relevant market factor for that position these market factor include spot price credit spread funding spread yield curve volatility and correlation and are updated periodically based on change in the composition of position well variation in market condition we sample from five year of historical data to generate the scenario for our var calculation the historical data is weighted so that the relative importance of the data reduces over time this give greater importance to more recent observation and reflects current asset volatility which improves the accuracy of our estimate of potential loss result even if our position included in var were unchanged our var would increase with increasing market volatility and vice versa given it reliance on historical data var is most effective in estimating risk exposure in market in which there are no sudden fundamental change or shift in market condition our var measure doe not include position that are not accounted for at fair value such held to maturity security and loan deposit and unsecured borrowing that are accounted for at amortized cost available for sale security for which the related unrealized fair value gain and loss are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss position that are best measured and monitored using sensitivity measure and the impact of change in counterparty and our own credit spread on

included in var to the var measure calculated of the prior business day at the firmwide level and for each of our business and major regulated subsidiary earnings at risk beginning in the fourth quarter of we started managing our interest rate risk using the ear metric ear measure the estimated impact of change in interest rate to our net revenue and preferred stock dividend over defined time horizon ear complement the var metric which measure the impact of interest rate change that have an immediate impact on the fair value of our asset and liability mark to market change our exposure to interest rate risk occurs due to variety of factor including but not limited to difference in maturity or repricing date of asset liability preferred stock and certain off balance sheet instrument difference in the amount of asset liability preferred stock and certain off balance sheet instrument with the same maturity or repricing date certain interest rate sensitive fee treasury manages the aggregated interest rate risk from all business through our investment security portfolio and interest rate derivative we measure ear over one year time horizon following basis point instantaneous parallel shock in both short and long term interest rate this sensitivity is calculated relative to baseline market scenario which take into consideration among other thing the market expectation of forward rate well our expectation of future business activity this scenario includes contractual element of asset liability preferred stock and certain off balance sheet instrument such rate of interest principal repayment schedule maturity and reset date and any interest rate ceiling or floor well assumption with respect to our balance sheet size and composition deposit repricing and prepayment behavior we manage ear with goal to reduce potential volatility resulting from change in interest rate so it remains within our ear risk appetite our ear scenario is regularly evaluated and updated if necessary to reflect change in our business plan market condition and other macroeconomic factor while management us the best information available to estimate ear actual result may differ materially result of among other thing change in the economic environment or assumption used in the process risk which is independent of our revenue producing unit and treasury have primary responsibility for assessing and monitoring ear through firmwide oversight including oversight of ear stress testing and assumption and the establishment of our ear risk appetite sachs form kthe goldman sachs group inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysisstress testing stress testing is method of determining the effect of various hypothetical stress scenario in addition to ear we use other stress test to examine risk of specific portfolio well the potential impact of our significant risk exposure we use variety of stress testing technique to calculate the potential loss from wide range of market move on our portfolio including firmwide stress test sensitivity analysis and scenario analysis the result of our various stress test are analyzed together for risk management purpose see overview and structure of risk management for information about firmwide stress test sensitivity analysis is used to quantify the impact of market move in single risk factor across all position equity price or credit spread using variety of defined market shock ranging from those that could be expected over one day time horizon up to those that could take many month to occur we also use sensitivity analysis to quantify the impact of the default of any single entity which capture the risk of large or concentrated exposure scenario analysis is used to quantify the impact of specified event including how the event impact multiple risk factor simultaneously for example for sovereign stress testing we calculate potential direct exposure associated with our sovereign position well the corresponding debt equity and currency exposure associated with our non sovereign position that may be impacted by the sovereign distress when conducting scenario analysis we often consider number of possible outcome for each scenario ranging from moderate to severely adverse market impact in addition these stress test are constructed using both historical event and forward looking hypothetical scenario unlike var measure which have an implied probability because they are calculated at specified confidence level there may not be an implied probability that our stress testing scenario will occur instead stress testing is used to model both moderate and more extreme move in underlying market factor when estimating potential loss we generally assume that our position can not be reduced or hedged although experience demonstrates that we are generally able to do so limit we use market risk limit at various level to manage the size of our market exposure these limit are set based on var ear and on range of stress test relevant to our exposure see overview and structure of risk management for information about the limit approval process limit are monitored by treasury and risk risk is responsible for identifying and escalating to senior management and or the appropriate risk committee on timely basis instance where limit have been exceeded due to positional change or change in market condition such increased volatility or change in correlation such instance are remediated by reduction in the position we hold and or temporary or permanent increase to the limit if warranted metric we analyze var at the firmwide level and variety of more detailed level including by risk category business and region diversification effect in the table
