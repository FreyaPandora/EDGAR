linde plc forward looking statement in light of risk of contentslinde plc and subsidiariespart iitem business generallinde plc is public limited company formed under the law of ireland with it principal office in the united kingdom and united state linde is the largest industrial gas company worldwide and is major technological innovator in the industrial gas industry it primary product in it industrial gas business are atmospheric gas oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gas and process gas carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gas specialty gas and acetylene etc the company also design and build equipment that produce industrial gas and offer customer wide range of gas production and processing service such olefin plant natural gas plant air separation plant hydrogen and synthesis gas plant and other type of plant linde serf diverse group of industry including healthcare chemical and energy manufacturing metal and mining food and beverage and electronics linde sale were million million and million for and respectively refer to item management discussion and analysis for discussion of consolidated sale and note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information related to linde reportable segment industrial gas product and manufacturing processesatmospheric gas are the highest volume product produced by linde using air it raw material linde produce oxygen nitrogen and argon several air separation process of which cryogenic air separation is the prevalent rare gas such krypton neon and xenon are also produced through cryogenic air separation pioneer in the industrial gas industry linde is leader in developing wide range of proprietary and patented application and supply system technology linde also led the development and commercialization of non cryogenic air separation technology for the production of industrial gas these technology open important new market and optimize production capacity for the company by lowering the cost of supplying industrial gas these technology include proprietary vacuum pressure swing adsorption vpsa and membrane separation to produce gaseous oxygen and nitrogen respectively process gas including carbon dioxide hydrogen helium specialty gas and acetylene are produced by method other air separation hydrogen is produced from range of feedstock using an array of different technology despite hydrogen an invisible molecule color are often used to designate and differentiate the production process used to produce the molecule the majority of hydrogen currently produced by linde is is termed gray hydrogen and is derived from natural gas or methane using steam methane reformation technology linde ha multiple technology to produce blue and green hydrogen which are considered type of clean energy blue hydrogen is produced by capturing the carbon emission from the hydrogen plant and either utilizing in way that stop them from being emitted or sequestering them in the subsurface for the long term green hydrogen is produced by electrolysis using renewable energy or from the steam methane reforming of biomethane low carbon intensity high purity hydrogen is also produced by purifying and recovering by product hydrogen source from the chemical and petrochemical industry helium is sourced from certain helium rich natural gas stream in the united state with additional supply being acquired from outside the united state carbon monoxide be produced by either steam methane reforming or auto thermal reforming of natural gas or other feed stream such naphtha acetylene is primarily sourced chemical by product but may also be produced from calcium carbide and water most carbon dioxide is purchased from by product source including chemical plant refinery and industrial process or is recovered from carbon dioxide well carbon dioxide is processed in linde plant to produce commercial and food grade carbon dioxide industrial gas distributionthere are three basic distribution method for industrial gas on site or tonnage ii merchant or bulk liquid and iii packaged or cylinder gas these distribution method are often integrated with product from all three supply mode coming from the plant the method of supply is generally determined by the lowest cost mean of meeting the customer need depending upon factor such volume requirement purity pattern of usage and the form in which the product is used gas or cryogenic liquid on site customer that require the largest volume of product typically oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen and that relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on site plant linde construct plant on or of contentsadjacent to these customer site and supply the product directly to customer by pipeline on site product supply contract generally are total requirement contract with term typically ranging from year and containing minimum purchase requirement and price escalation provision many of the cryogenic on site plant also produce liquid product for the merchant market therefore plant are typically not dedicated to single customer advanced air separation process allow on site delivery to customer with smaller volume requirement merchant the merchant business is generally associated with distributable liquid oxygen nitrogen argon carbon dioxide hydrogen and helium the delivery generally are made from linde plant by tanker truck to storage container at the customer site which are usually owned and maintained by linde and leased to the customer due to distribution cost merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have relatively small distribution radius from the plant at which they are produced merchant argon hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distance the customer agreement used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year requirement contract packaged gas customer requiring small volume are supplied product in metal container called cylinder under medium to high pressure packaged gas include atmospheric gas carbon dioxide hydrogen helium acetylene and related product linde also produce and distributes in cylinder wide range of specialty gas and mixture cylinder may be delivered to the customer site or picked by the customer at packaging facility or retail store packaged gas are generally sold under one to three year supply

result and or cash flow linde serf diverse group of industry across than country which generally lead to financial stability through various business cycle however broad decline in general economic or business condition in the industry served by it customer could adversely affect the demand for linde product and impair the ability of it customer to satisfy their obligation to linde resulting in uncollected receivables and or unanticipated contract termination or project delay for example global political and economic uncertainty could reduce investment activity of linde customer which could adversely affect linde business in addition many of linde customer are in business that are cyclical in nature such the chemical metal and energy industry downturn in these industry may adversely impact linde during these cycle additionally such condition could impact the utilization of linde manufacturing capacity which may require it to recognize impairment loss on tangible asset such property plant and equipment well intangible asset such goodwill customer relationship or intellectual property increase in the cost of energy and raw material and or disruption in the supply of these material could result in lost sale or reduced profitability energy is the single largest cost item in the production and distribution of industrial gas most of linde energy requirement are in the form of electricity natural gas and diesel fuel for distribution linde attempt to minimize the financial impact of variability in these cost through the management of customer contract and reducing demand through operational productivity and energy efficiency large customer contract typically have escalation and pas through clause to recover energy and feedstock cost such attempt may not successfully mitigate cost variability which could negatively impact linde financial condition or result of operation the supply of energy ha not been significant issue in the geographic area where linde conduct business however regional energy condition are unpredictable and may pose future risk for carbon dioxide carbon monoxide helium hydrogen and specialty gas raw material are largely purchased from outside source where feasible linde source several of these raw material including carbon dioxide hydrogen and calcium carbide chemical or industrial byproduct in addition linde ha contract or commitment for or readily available source of most of these raw material however their long term availability and price are subject to market condition disruption in supply of such raw material could

international operation of linde in the future by reducing the demand for it product decreasing the price at which it can sell it product reducing the revenue from international operation or otherwise an adverse effect on it business currency exchange rate fluctuation and other related risk may adversely affect linde result significant portion of linde revenue is denominated in currency other than it reporting currency the dollar change in exchange rate will produce fluctuation in revenue cost and earnings and may also affect the book of contentsvalue of asset and liability and related equity although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contract to hedge these exposure it effort to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transaction may not be successful depending on market and business condition result fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate could adversely affect linde financial condition result of operation or cash flow macroeconomic factor may impact linde ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact linde financial result and or cash flow volatility and disruption in the european and global credit and equity market from time to time could make it more difficult for linde to obtain financing for it operation and or could increase the cost of obtaining financing in addition linde borrowing cost can be affected by short and long term debt rating assigned by independent rating agency which are based in significant part on it performance measured by certain criterion such

and efficient workforce to be successful much of linde competitive advantage is based on the expertise and experience of key personnel regarding marketing technology manufacturing and distribution infrastructure system and product the inability to attract and hire qualified individual or the loss of key employee in skilled area could have negative effect on linde financial result if linde fails to keep pace with technological advance in the industry or if new technology initiative not become commercially accepted customer may not continue to buy linde product and result of operation could be adversely affected linde research and development is directed toward developing new and improved method for the production and distribution of industrial gas the design and construction of plant and toward developing new market and application for the use of industrial and process gas this result in the introduction of new application and the development of new advanced process technology result of these effort linde develops new and proprietary technology and employ necessary measure to protect such technology within the global geography in which linde operates these technology help linde to create competitive advantage and to provide platform to grow it business if linde research and of contentsdevelopment activity do not keep pace with competitor or if linde doe not create new technology that benefit customer future result of operation could be adversely affected risk related to pension benefit plan may adversely impact linde result of operation and cash flow pension benefit represent significant financial obligation that will be ultimately settled in the future with employee meet eligibility requirement because of the uncertainty involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payment and asset return significant estimate are required to calculate pension expense and liability related to linde plan linde utilizes the service of independent actuary whose model are used to facilitate these calculation several key assumption are used in the actuarial model to calculate pension expense and liability amount recorded in the consolidated financial statement in particular significant change in actual investment return on pension asset discount rate or legislative or regulatory change could impact future result of operation and required pension contribution operational risk may adversely impact linde business or result of operation linde operating result are dependent on the continued operation of it production facility and it ability to meet customer contract requirement and other need insufficient or excess capacity threatens linde ability to generate competitive profit margin and may expose linde to liability related to contract

business to loss of revenue potential litigation and loss of business reputation also inherent in the management of linde production facility and delivery system including storage vehicle transportation and pipeline are operational risk that require continuous training oversight and control material operating failure at production storage facility or pipeline including fire toxic release and explosion or the occurrence of vehicle transportation accident could result in loss of life damage to the environment loss of production and or extensive property damage all of which may negatively impact linde financial result linde may be subject to information technology system failure network disruption and breach in data security linde relies on information technology system and network for business and operational activity and also store and process sensitive business and proprietary information in these system and network these system are susceptible to outage due to fire flood power loss telecommunication failure virus break in and similar event or breach of security linde ha taken step to address these risk and concern by implementing advanced security technology internal control network and data center resiliency and recovery process despite these step however information technology system have in the past been and in the future will likely be subject to increasingly sophisticated cyber attack operational failure and breach of security from such attempt could lead to the loss or disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to linde or our employee and customer or supplier these failure and breach could result in business interruption or malfunction and lead to legal or regulatory action that could result in material adverse impact on linde operation reputation and financial result to date such attempt have not had any significant impact on linde operation or financial result the inability to effectively integrate acquisition or collaborate with joint venture partner could adversely impact linde financial position and result of operation linde ha evaluated and expects to continue to evaluate wide array of potential strategic acquisition and joint venture many of these transaction if consummated could be material to it financial condition and result of operation in addition the process of integrating an acquired company business or group of asset may create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure although historically linde ha been successful with it acquisition strategy and execution the area where linde may face risk include the need to implement or remediate control procedure and policy appropriate for larger public company at company that prior to the acquisition lacked these control procedure and policy diversion of management time and focus from operating existing business to acquisition integration challenge of content cultural challenge associated with integrating employee from the acquired company into the existing organization the need to integrate each company accounting management information human resource and other administrative system to permit effective management difficulty with the assimilation of acquired operation and product failure to achieve targeted synergy and cost reduction and inability to retain key employee and business relationship of acquired company foreign acquisition and joint venture involve unique risk in addition to those mentioned herein including those related to integration of operation across different culture and language currency risk and the particular economic political and regulatory risk associated with specific country also the anticipated benefit of potential future acquisition may not materialize future acquisition or disposition could result in the incurrence of debt contingent liability or amortization expense or impairment of goodwill any of which could adversely impact linde

business financial position and result of operation linde is subject to regulation in the following area among others environmental protection including climate change and energy efficiency law and policy and non tax law and currency control safety security law applicable in the united state the european union germany ireland and other jurisdiction trade and import export restriction well economic sanction law antitrust matter data protection global anti bribery law including the foreign corrupt practice act and healthcare regulation change in these or other regulatory area may impact linde profitability and may give rise to new or increased compliance risk it may become more complex and costly to ensure compliance and the level of sanction in the event of non compliance may rise noncompliance with such law and regulation could result in penalty or sanction cancellation of marketing right or restriction on participation in or even exclusion from public tender proceeding all of which could have material adverse impact on linde financial result and or reputation such change may also restrict linde ability to compete effectively in the marketplace change to regulation in the area of environmental protection and climate change for example may impact customer and competitor behavior driving structural change in key end market while linde will work to mitigate these risk through the pursuit of strategic alliance and investment in application technology to capture new growth area given the uncertainty about the type and scope of new regulation it is difficult to predict how such change and their impact on market behavior will ultimately impact linde business however such change could have material adverse impact on linde result of operation doing business globally requires linde to comply with anti corruption trade compliance and economic sanction and similar law and to implement policy and procedure designed to ensure that it employee and other intermediary comply with the applicable restriction these restriction include prohibition on the sale or supply of certain product service and any other economic resource to embargoed or sanctioned country government person and entity compliance with these restriction requires among other thing screening of business partner despite it commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethic the

damage to linde reputation principal possible cause of risk associated with product and service are product defect or an inadequate level of customer care linde is providing service linde is exposed to legal risk relating to product liability in the country where it operates including country such the united state where legal risk in particular through class action have historically been more significant than in other country the outcome of any pending or future product and service proceeding or investigation can not be predicted and legal or regulatory judgment or agreed settlement may give rise to significant loss cost and expense the manufacturing and sale of product well the construction and sale of plant by linde may give rise to risk associated with the production filling

upon linde or such person or to enforce outside the united state judgment obtained against such person in court in any action including action predicated upon the civil liability provision of the federal security law in addition it may be difficult for investor to enforce in original action brought in court in jurisdiction located outside the united state right predicated upon the federal security law judgment for the payment of money rendered by court in the united state based on civil liability would not be automatically enforceable in ireland is no treaty between ireland and the united state providing for the reciprocal enforcement of foreign judgment the following requirement must be met before the foreign judgment will be deemed to be enforceable in ireland the judgment must be for definite sum ii the judgment must be final and conclusive and iii the judgment must be provided by court of competent jurisdiction an irish court will also exercise it right to refuse judgment if the foreign judgment wa obtained by fraud ii violated irish public policy iii is in breach of natural justice or iv if the judgment is irreconcilable with an earlier foreign judgment in

tax resident company would directly affect linde change in linde tax residency could have negative effect on the company future profitability and may trigger tax on dividend or exit charge if linde cease to be resident in the and becomes resident in another jurisdiction it may be subject to exit charge and or could become liable for additional tax charge in the other jurisdiction if linde were to be treated resident in more than one jurisdiction it could be subject to duplicative taxation furthermore although linde is incorporated in ireland and is not expected to be treated domestic corporation for federal income tax purpose it is possible that the irs could challenge this result or that change in federal income tax law could alter this result if the irs successfully asserted such position or the law were to change significant adverse tax consequence may result for linde the company and linde shareholder change in tax law may result in higher tax expense and tax payment in addition change in tax legislation and uncertainty about the tax environment in some region may restrict linde opportunity to enforce it respective right under the law linde also operates in country

forthcoming but can not guarantee this and distributable reserve of new linde are created new linde will be unable to make distribution by way of dividend share repurchase or otherwise under irish law under irish law dividend may be paid and share repurchase and redemption must generally be funded only of distributable reserve which new linde will not have immediately following the reorganization the creation of distributable reserve of new linde involves reduction in new linde undenominated share capital which requires the approval of the irish high court the approval of the irish high court is expected within eight week following the reorganization becoming effective this approval is the same process successfully followed by linde immediately after the linde ag praxair inc merger in new linde is not aware of any reason the irish high court would not approve the creation of distributable reserve in this manner however the issuance of the required order is matter for the discretion of the irish high court in the event that distributable reserve of new linde are not created no distribution by way of dividend share repurchase or otherwise will be permitted under irish law until such

or mitigate the adverse effect of greenhouse gas ghg emission and therefore face highly uncertain regulatory environment in this area for example the environmental protection agency epa ha promulgated rule requiring reporting of ghg emission to which linde it supplier and customer are subject to epa ha also promulgated regulation to restrict ghg emission including final rule regulating ghg emission from light duty vehicle and certain large manufacturing facility many of which are linde supplier or customer in addition to these development in the united state several other country worldwide have already implemented carbon taxation or trading system which impact the company and it customer including regulation in china singapore and the european union among other impact such regulation are expected to raise the cost of energy which is significant cost for linde nevertheless linde long term customer contract routinely provide right to recover increased electricity natural gas and other cost that are incurred by the company result of climate change regulation linde anticipates continued growth in hydrogen sale due to increased focus on decarbonization project traditionally hydrogen production plant and large number of other manufacturing and electricity generating plant have been identified in california and the european union source of carbon dioxide emission and these plant are subject to cap and trade regulation in those jurisdiction linde belief it will be able to mitigate the cost of these regulation through the term of it product supply contract however legislation that limit ghg emission may impact growth by increasing capital compliance operating and maintenance cost and or decreasing demand to manage business risk from current and potential ghg emission regulation well physical consequence of climate change linde actively monitor current development evaluates the direct and indirect business risk and take appropriate action among others action include increasing relevant resource and training maintaining contingency plan obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendor insurance provider and industry expert incorporating ghg provision in

factor include governmental regulation of ghg and other emission uncertain cost of energy and certain natural resource the development of renewable energy alternative and new technology that help extract natural gas improve air quality increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impact of climate change linde continues to develop new application that can help customer lower emission by reducing energy consumption and increasing product throughput stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economy such china provide growing market for number of gas oxygen for wastewater

are determined by management and have been reviewed by linde audit committee revenue recognitionlong term construction contract the company design and manufacture equipment for air separation and other varied gas production and processing plant manufactured specifically for end customer revenue for sale of equipment contract are generally recognized over time linde ha an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance doe not create an asset with alternative use for contract recognized over time revenue is recognized primarily using cost incurred input method cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligation the result is applied to total expected revenue and result in financial statement recognition of revenue in addition to cost incurred to date any expected loss on contract is recognized an expense immediately contract modification are typically accounted for part of the existing contract and are recognized cumulative adjustment for the inception to date effect of such change ass performance progress towards completion is achieved on specific project earnings will be impacted by change to our forecast of revenue and cost on these project the cost incurred input method place considerable importance on accurate estimate of the extent of progress towards completion and may involve estimate on the scope of delivery and service required to fulfill the contractually defined obligation the key source of estimation uncertainty is the total estimated cost at completion including material labor and overhead cost and the resultant state of completion of the contract there are inherent uncertainty associated with the estimation process including technical complexity duration of construction cycle potential cost inflation whether equipment or manpower and scope consideration all of which may affect the total estimation process change in these estimate may lead to significant impact on future financial statement of contentspension benefitspension benefit represent financial obligation that will be ultimately settled in the future with employee who meet eligibility requirement because of the uncertainty involved in estimating the timing and amount of future payment significant estimate are required to calculate pension expense and liability related to the company plan the company utilizes the service of independent actuary whose model are used to facilitate these calculation several key assumption are used in actuarial model to calculate pension expense and liability amount recorded in the financial statement management belief the three most significant variable in the model are the expected long term rate of return on plan asset the discount rate and the expected rate of compensation increase the actuarial model also use assumption for various other factor including long term inflation rate employee turnover retirement age and mortality linde management belief the assumption used in the actuarial calculation are reasonable reflect the company experience and expectation for the future and are within accepted practice in each of the respective geographic location in which it operates actual result in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumption because of economic and other factor the sensitivity to each of the key assumption presented below exclude the impact of special item that occurred during the year the weighted average expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset were for plan and for non plan for the year ended december and respectively at december the expected long term rate of return on the and non plan asset is estimated based on the plan investment strategy and asset allocation historical capital market performance and to lesser extent historical plan performance change in these expected long term rate of return with all other variable held constant would change linde pension expense by approximately million the company ha consistently used market related value of asset rather than the fair value at the measurement date to determine annual pension expense the market related value recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period result change in the fair value of asset from year to year are not immediately reflected in the company annual pension expense instead annual pension expense in future period will be impacted deferred investment gain or loss are recognized in the market related value of asset over the five year period the consolidated market related value of asset wa million or million higher than the fair value of asset of million at december these net deferred investment gain of million will be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of asset ratably over the next four year and will impact future pension expense future actual investment gain or loss will impact the market related value of asset and therefore will impact future annual pension expense in similar manner discount rate are used to calculate the present value of plan liability and pension cost and are determined annually by management the company measure the service and interest cost component of pension and opeb expense for significant and non plan using the spot rate approach plan that do not use the spot rate approach continue to determine discount rate by using cash flow matching model provided by the company independent actuary the model includes portfolio of corporate bond graded aa or better by at least half of the rating agency and match the plan projected cash flow to the calculated spot rate discount rate for the remaining non plan are based on market yield for high quality fixed income investment representing the approximate duration of the pension liability on the measurement date refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for summary of the discount rate used to calculate plan liability and benefit cost and to the retirement benefit section of the consolidated result and other information section of this md for further discussion of benefit cost reduction in discount rate with all other variable held constant would increase linde pension expense by approximately million whereas increase in discount rate would result in decrease of million reduction in discount rate would increase the pbo by approximately million whereas increase in discount rate would have favorable impact to the pbo of approximately million the weighted average expected rate of compensation increase wa for plan and for non plan at december and respectively at december the estimated annual compensation increase is determined by management every year and is based on historical trend and market index change in the expected rate of compensation increase with all other variable held constant would change linde pension expense by approximately million and would impact the pbo by approximately million asset impairmentsgoodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assetsat december the company had goodwill of million and million of other indefinite lived intangible asset goodwill represents the aggregate of the excess consideration paid for acquired business over the fair value of the net asset acquired indefinite lived other intangible relate to the linde name of contentsthe company performs goodwill impairment test annually of october or more frequently if event or circumstance indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred the impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of indicated no impairment at december linde enterprise value wa approximately billion outstanding share multiplied by the year end stock price plus net debt and without any control premium while it total capital wa approximately billion the impairment test allows an entity to first ass qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than carrying value if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than carrying value then the company will estimate and compare the fair value of it reporting unit to their carrying value including goodwill reporting unit are determined based on one level below the operating segment level management belief that the quantitative and qualitative factor used to perform it annual goodwill impairment assessment are appropriate and reasonable although the assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded it carrying value change in circumstance or condition affecting this analysis could have significant impact on the fair value determination which could then result in material impairment charge to the company result of operation reporting unit with greater concentration of linde ag asset fair valued during the praxair inc and linde ag merger are at greater risk of impairment in future period other indefinite lived intangible asset are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if event and circumstance indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred and no impairment were indicated see note and to the consolidated financial statement long lived assetslong lived asset including property plant and equipment and finite lived other intangible asset are tested for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an individual asset or asset group may not be recoverable for purpose of this test asset group are determined based upon the lowest level for which there are independent and identifiable cash flow based upon linde business model an asset group may be single plant and related asset used to support on site merchant and packaged gas customer alternatively the asset group may be collection of distribution related asset cylinder distribution center and store or be pipeline complex which includes multiple interdependent plant and related asset connected by pipeline within geographic area used to support the same distribution method result of the russia ukraine conflict linde deconsolidated it russian gas and engineering business entity of june see note to the consolidated financial statement income taxesat december linde had deferred

statement income tax expense wa million for the year ended december or about of pre tax income see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information related to tax in the preparation of consolidated financial statement linde estimate income tax based on diverse legislative and regulatory structure that exist in various jurisdiction where the company conduct business deferred income tax asset and liability represent tax benefit or obligation that arise from temporary difference due to differing treatment of certain item for accounting and income tax purpose linde evaluates deferred tax asset each period to ensure that estimated future taxable income will be sufficient in character capital gain versus ordinary income treatment amount and timing to result in their recovery valuation allowance is established when management determines that it is more likely than not that deferred tax asset will not be realized to reduce the asset to their realizable value considerable judgment are required in establishing deferred tax valuation allowance and in assessing exposure related to tax matter event and circumstance change related reserve and valuation allowance are adjusted to income at that time linde tax return are subject to audit and local taxing authority could challenge the company tax position the company practice is to review tax filing

recorded incurred commitment represent obligation such those for future purchase of good or service that are not yet recorded on the company balance sheet liability the company record liability for commitment when incurred when the good or service are received contingent liabilitieslinde is subject to various lawsuit and government investigation that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business these action are based upon alleged environmental tax antitrust and personal injury claim among others linde ha strong defense in these case and intends to defend vigorously it is possible that the company may incur loss in connection with some of these action in excess of accrued liability management doe not anticipate individually or in the aggregate such loss would have material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial position or liquidity however it is possible that the final outcome could have significant impact on the company reported result of operation in any given period significant matter are during the brazilian government published law instituting new voluntary amnesty program refis program which allowed brazilian company to settle certain federal tax dispute at reduced amount during the company decided that it wa economically beneficial to settle many of it outstanding federal tax dispute and such dispute were enrolled in the

reach final agreement on the calculation and initiated litigation against the government in an attempt to resolve certain item open issue relate to the following matter application of cash deposit and net operating loss carryforwards to satisfy obligation and ii the amount of tax reduction available under the refis program it is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of legal matter in brazil at december the most significant non income and income tax claim in brazil after enrollment in the refis program relate to state vat tax matter and federal income tax matter where the taxing authority are challenging the tax rate that should be applied to income generated by subsidiary company that previously received favorable ruling the total estimated exposure relating to such claim including interest and penalty appropriate is approximately million linde ha not recorded any liability related to such claim based on management judgment after considering judgment and opinion of outside counsel because litigation in brazil historically take many year to resolve it is very difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of these matter however it is possible that certain of these matter may be resolved within the near term the company is vigorously defending against the proceeding on february the brazilian supreme court issued decision confirming the constitutionality of specific federal income tax with retroactive effect this decision ha not yet been finalized and is subject to ongoing motion for clarification the timing of when this decision will be final and the potential impact on the company tax liability remain uncertain at this time on september cade brazilian administrative council for economic defense announced alleged anticompetitive activity on the

cade filed an appeal with the superior court of justice and final decision is pending linde ha strong defense and is confident that it will prevail on appeal and have the fine overturned linde strongly belief that the allegation of anticompetitive activity against our current and former brazilian subsidiary are not supported by valid and sufficient evidence linde belief that this decision will not stand up to judicial review and deems the possibility of cash outflow to be extremely unlikely result no reserve have been recorded management doe not believe that loss from this case is probable on and after april former shareholder of linde ag filed appraisal proceeding at the district court landgericht munich germany seeking an increase of the cash consideration paid in connection with the previously completed cash merger squeeze out of all of linde ag minority shareholder for per share any such increase would apply to all linde ag share that were outstanding on april when the cash merger squeeze out wa completed the period for plaintiff to file claim expired on july the company belief the consideration paid wa fair and that the claim lack merit and no reserve ha been established we can not estimate the timing of resolution on december the russian arbitration court of the st petersburg and leningrad region issued an injunction preventing the sale of any share in linde subsidiary and joint venture in russia and ii the disposal of any of asset in those entity exceeding of the relevant company overall asset value the injunction is not expected to have any impact

entity of june see note and the remaining investment value of it russia subsidiary is immaterial such the obligation to satisfy any residual contract liability is not expected to have an adverse impact on earnings but may result in net cash outflow it is difficult to estimate the timing of resolution of this matter the company intends to vigorously defend it interest in both the injunction

industrial gas are distributed to various end market within regional segment through one of three basic distribution method on site or tonnage merchant or bulk and packaged or cylinder gas the distribution method are generally integrated in order to best meet the customer need and very few of it product can be economically transported outside of region therefore the distribution economics

reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for the good or service contract with customerslinde serf diverse group of industry including healthcare chemical and energy manufacturing metal and mining food and beverage and electronics industrial gaseswithin each of the company geographic segment for industrial gas there are three basic distribution method on site or tonnage ii merchant or bulk liquid and iii packaged or cylinder gas the distribution method used by linde to supply customer is determined by many factor including the customer volume requirement and location the distribution method generally determines the contract term with the customer and accordingly the revenue recognition accounting practice linde primary product in it industrial gas business are atmospheric gas oxygen nitrogen argon rare gas and process gas carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gas specialty gas acetylene these product are generally sold through one of the three distribution method following is description of each of the three industrial gas distribution method and the respective revenue recognition policy on site customer that require the largest volume of product and that have relatively constant demand pattern are supplied by cryogenic and process gas on site plant linde construct plant on or adjacent to these customer site and supply the product directly to customer by pipeline where there are large concentration of customer single pipeline may be connected to several plant and customer on site product supply contract generally are total requirement contract with term typically ranging from year and contain minimum purchase requirement and price escalation provision many of the cryogenic on site plant also produce liquid product for the merchant market therefore plant are typically not dedicated to single customer additionally linde is responsible for the design construction operation and maintenance of the plant and our customer typically have no involvement in these activity advanced air separation process also allow on site delivery to customer with smaller volume requirement the company performance obligation related to on site customer are satisfied over time customer receive and obtain control of the product linde ha elected to apply the practical expedient for measuring progress towards the completion of performance obligation and recognizes revenue the company ha the right to invoice each customer which generally corresponds with product delivery accordingly revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company ha the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract term consideration in these contract is generally based on pricing which fluctuates with various price index variable component of consideration exist within on site contract but are considered constrained merchant merchant delivery generally are made from linde plant by tanker truck to storage container at the customer site due to the relatively high distribution cost merchant oxygen and nitrogen generally have relatively small distribution radius from the plant at which they are produced merchant argon hydrogen and helium can be shipped much longer distance the customer agreement used in the merchant business are usually three to seven year supply agreement based on the requirement of the customer these contract generally do not contain minimum purchase requirement or volume commitment the company performance obligation related to merchant customer are generally satisfied at point in time the customer receive and obtain control of the product revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer and the company ha the right to invoice the customer in accordance with the contract term any variable component of consideration within merchant contract are constrained however this consideration is not significant packaged gas customer requiring small volume are supplied product in container called cylinder under medium to high pressure linde distributes merchant gas from it production plant to company owned cylinder filling plant where cylinder are then filled for distribution to customer cylinder may be delivered to the customer site or picked up by the customer at packaging facility or retail store linde invoice the customer for the industrial gas and the use of the cylinder container the company also sell hardgoods and welding equipment purchased from independent manufacturer packaged gas are generally sold under one to three year supply contract and purchase order and do not contain minimum purchase requirement or volume commitment of contentsthe company performance obligation related to packaged gas are satisfied at point in time accordingly revenue is recognized when product is delivered to the customer or when the customer pick up product from packaged gas facility or retail store and the company ha the right to payment from the customer in accordance with the contract term any variable consideration is constrained and will be recognized when the uncertainty related to the consideration is resolved engineering the company design and manufacture equipment for air separation and other industrial gas application manufactured specifically for end customer sale of equipment contract are generally comprised of single performance obligation revenue from sale of equipment is generally recognized over time linde ha an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and performance doe not create an asset with alternative use for contract recognized over time revenue is recognized primarily using cost incurred input method cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligation cost incurred include material labor and overhead cost and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer change to cost estimate and contract modification are typically accounted for part of the existing contract and are recognized cumulative adjustment for the inception to date effect of such change contract asset and liabilitiescontract asset and liability result from difference in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing contract asset primarily relate to sale of equipment contract for which revenue is recognized over time the balance represents unbilled revenue which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure

significant disaggregated revenue informationas described above and in note the company manages it industrial gas business on geographic basis while the engineering and other business are generally managed on global basis furthermore the company belief that reporting sale by distribution method by reportable geographic segment best illustrates the nature timing type of customer and contract term

content million of dollar year ended december merchant on packaged million of dollar year ended december merchant on packaged million of dollar year ended december merchant on packaged remaining performance obligationsas described above linde contract with on site customer are under long term supply arrangement which generally require the customer to purchase their requirement from linde and also have minimum purchase requirement additionally plant sale from the linde engineering business are primarily contracted on fixed price basis the company estimate the consideration related to future minimum purchase requirement and plant sale wa approximately billion excludes russian project which are impacted by sanction refer to note this amount excludes all on site sale above minimum purchase requirement which can be significant depending on customer need in the future actual amount will be different due to impact from several factor many of which are beyond the company control including but not limited to timing of newly signed terminated and renewed contract inflationary price escalation currency exchange rate and pas through cost related to natural gas and electricity the actual duration of long term supply contract range up to twenty year the company estimate that approximately half of the revenue related to minimum purchase requirement will be earned in the next five
