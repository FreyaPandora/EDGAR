policiespreparation of the company financial statement requires management to make judgment assumption and estimate regarding uncertainty that could affect reported revenue expense asset liability and equity note describes the significant accounting policy used in preparation of the consolidated financial statement the most significant area where management judgment and estimate impact the primary financial statement are described below actual result in these area could differ materially from management estimate under different assumption or condition revenue recognitionthe company recognizes large majority of it revenue through the sale of manufactured product and record the sale when product are shipped or delivered title and risk of loss pas to the customer and collection is reasonably assured in certain circumstance revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method performance occurs or in accordance with asc related to software sale arrangement sometimes involve delivering multiple element which requires management judgment that affect the amount and timing of revenue recognized in these instance the revenue assigned to each element is based on vendor specific objective evidence third party evidence or management estimate of the relative selling price revenue is recognized for delivered element if they have value to the customer on stand alone basis and performance related to the undelivered item is probable and substantially in the company control or the undelivered element are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingency related to payment the vast majority of deliverable are tangible product with smaller portion attributable to installation service or maintenance management belief that all relevant criterion and condition are considered when recognizing revenue inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the majority of inventory is valued based on standard cost which approximate average cost while the remainder is principally valued on first in first basis cost standard are revised at the beginning of each year the annual effect of resetting standard plus any operating variance incurred during each period are allocated to inventory and recognized in cost of sale product is sold the company business review inventory for obsolescence make appropriate provision and dispose of obsolete inventory on regular basis various factor are considered in these review including sale history and recent trend industry condition and general economic condition if actual circumstance indicate decline in any of these factor particularly an abrupt change in economic condition the company could incur higher level of obsolescence expense long lived assetslong lived asset which include property plant and equipment goodwill and identifiable intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in business circumstance indicate impairment may exist if the company determines that the carrying value of long lived asset may not be recoverable permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds it estimated fair value reporting unit are also reviewed for possible goodwill impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not an impairment may exist it is evaluated by comparing the unit estimated fair value to it carrying value fair value is generally estimated using an income approach that discount estimated future cash flow using discount rate judged by management to be commensurate with the applicable risk estimate of future sale operating result cash flow and discount rate are subject to change in the economic environment including such factor the general level of market interest rate expected equity market return and the volatility of market served particularly when recessionary economic circumstance continue for an extended period of time management belief the estimate of future cash flow and fair value are reasonable however change in estimate due to variance from assumption could materially affect the evaluation retirement plan the company maintains prudent long term investment strategy consistent with the duration of pension obligation the determination of defined benefit plan expense

local currency financial statement into dollar are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income cash equivalentscash equivalent consist of highly liquid investment with original maturity of three month or le inventoriesinventories are stated at the lower of cost or market the majority of inventory is valued based on standard cost which approximate average cost while the remainder is principally valued on first in first out basis cost standard are revised at the beginning of each fiscal year the annual effect of resetting standard plus any operating variance incurred during each period are allocated to inventory and recognized in cost of sale product is sold following are the component of inventory of september product material and work in process total inventory increase is primarily due to the valve control acquisition see note fair value measurementasc fair value measurement establishes formal hierarchy and framework for measuring certain financial statement item at fair value and requires disclosure about fair value measurement and the reliability of valuation input under asc measurement assumes the transaction to sell an asset or transfer liability occurs in the principal or at least the most advantageous market for that asset or liability within the hierarchy level instrument use observable market price for an identical item in active market and have the most reliable valuation level instrument are valued through broker dealer quotation or other approach using market observable input for similar item in active market including forward and spot price interest rate and volatility level instrument are valued using input not observable in an active market such company developed future cash flow estimate and are considered the least reliable valuation for all of the company financial instrument fall within level the fair value of the company long term debt is level estimated using current interest rate and pricing from financial institution and other market source for debt with similar maturity and characteristic property plant and equipmentthe company record investment in land building and machinery and equipment at cost depreciation is computed principally using the straight line method over estimated service life which for principal asset are to year for building and to year for machinery and equipment long lived tangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in business circumstance indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable impairment loss are recognized based on estimated fair value if the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flow of the related asset is le than the carrying value the component of property plant and equipment of september follow and equipment in progress property plant and equipment at cost accumulated depreciation property plant and equipment net increase is primarily due to the valve control acquisition see note goodwill and other intangible assetsassets and liability acquired in business combination are accounted for using the acquisition method and recorded at their respective fair value substantially all goodwill is assigned to the

that business unit is prepared and regularly reviewed by the segment manager the company conduct annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter if an initial assessment indicates it is more likely than not goodwill might be impaired it is evaluated by comparing the reporting unit estimated fair value to it carrying value goodwill is also tested for impairment between annual test if event or circumstance indicate the fair value of unit may be le than it carrying value if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value impairment is recognized to the extent that recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill estimated fair value of reporting unit are level measure and are developed generally under an income approach that discount estimated future cash flow using risk adjusted interest rate all of the company identifiable intangible asset are subject to amortization on straight line basis over their estimated useful life identifiable intangible consist of intellectual property such patent and trademark customer relationship and capitalized software identifiable intangible are also subject to evaluation for potential impairment if event or

on stand alone basis and performance related to the undelivered item is probable and substantially in the company control or the undelivered element are inconsequential or perfunctory and there are no unsatisfied contingency related to payment approximately five percent of the company revenue from continuing operation arise from qualifying sale arrangement that include the delivery of multiple element principally in the automation solution segment the vast majority of these deliverable are tangible product with smaller portion attributable to installation service or maintenance generally
