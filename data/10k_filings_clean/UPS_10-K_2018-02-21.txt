business financial condition or result of operation you should read these risk factor in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item and our consolidated financial statement and related note in item general economic condition both in the and internationally may adversely affect our result of operation we conduct operation in over country and territory our and international operation are subject to normal cycle affecting the economy in general well the local economic environment in which we operate the factor that create cyclical change to the economy and to our business are beyond our control may adversely impact our credit rating and it may be difficult for to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factor in particular our business is affected by level of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and result of operation could be materially affected by adverse development in these aspect of the economy the united kingdom vote to leave the european union could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we face significant competition on local regional national and international basis our competitor include the postal service of the and other nation various motor carrier express company freight forwarders air courier and others competition may also come from other source in the future some of our competitor have cost and organizational structure that differ from and may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressure our business financial position and result of operation could be adversely affected the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong result of consolidation our competitor may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive position business combination could also result in competitor providing wider variety of service and product at competitive price which could adversely affect our financial performance change in our relationship with our significant customer including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on no single customer account for or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or result of operation however collectively some of our large customer might account for relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in particular quarter or year these customer can drive the growth in revenue for particular service based on factor such new customer product launch trend in the commerce industry such the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business merger and acquisition and the overall fast growth of customer underlying business these customer could choose to divert all or portion of their business with to one of our competitor demand pricing concession for our service require to provide enhanced service that increase our cost or develop their own shipping and distribution capability if these factor drove some of our large customer to cancel all or portion of their business relationship with it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long term financial forecast our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the and internationally we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental law regulation and policy both in the and in the other country in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by law regulation and policy that affect global trade including tariff and trade policy export requirement tax monetary policy and other restriction and charge change in law regulation and policy and the related interpretation may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our cost of business the impact of new law regulation and policy can not be predicted compliance with new law and regulation may increase our operating cost or require significant capital expenditure any failure to comply with applicable law or regulation in the or in any of the country in which we operate could result in substantial fine or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operation which could adversely affect our financial performance security requirement could impose substantial cost on and we could be the target of an attack or have security breach result of concern about global terrorism and homeland security government around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirement that will result in increased operating cost for business in the transportation industry these requirement may change periodically result of regulatory and legislative requirement and in response to evolving threat we can not determine the effect that these new requirement will have on our cost structure or our operating result and these rule or other future security requirement may increase our cost of operation and reduce operating efficiency regardless of our compliance with security requirement or the step we take to secure our facility or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breach could occur which could adversely affect our operation or our reputation we are subject to increasingly stringent regulation related to climate change and new regulation could materially increase our operating cost concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant legislative and regulatory effort particularly internationally but also in the united state to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission state and local government also are increasingly considering ghg regulation the possibility of increased regulation of ghg emission potentially expose our transportation and logistics business to significant new tax fee and other cost compliance with such potential regulation or the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change we are subject to international regulation of ghg emission for example in the european commission approved the extension to the airline industry of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission under this decision all of our flight operating within the european union are covered by the ets requirement and we are required annually to purchase emission allowance in an amount exceeding the number of free allowance allocated to under the ets similarly in the international civil aviation organization icao passed resolution adopting the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation corsia which is global market based emission offset program to encourage carbon neutral growth beyond pilot phase is scheduled to begin in in which country may voluntarily participate and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in icao continues to develop detail regarding implementation but compliance with corsia will increase our operating cost in the congress in the past several year ha considered various bill that would regulate ghg emission but these bill so far have not received sufficient congressional support for enactment nevertheless some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency epa spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act could determine to regulate ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission and this could impose substantial cost on in august the announced it intention to withdraw from the paris climate accord an agreement among country to reduce ghg emission and the effect of that withdrawal on future policy regarding ghg emission on corsia and on other ghg regulation is uncertain nevertheless the extent to which other country implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business we may face additional regulation regarding ghg emission internationally and in the united state potential cost to of increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely however the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible that such regulation could significantly increase our operating expense if we are unable to pas such cost along to our customer moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air service work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation significant number of our employee are employed under national master agreement and various supplemental agreement with local union affiliated with the teamster in addition our airline pilot airline mechanic ground mechanic and certain other employee are employed under other collective bargaining agreement strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our ability to meet our customer need and customer may do more business with competitor if they believe that such action or threatened action may adversely affect our ability to provide service we may face permanent loss of customer if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation the term of future collective bargaining agreement also may affect our competitive position and result of operation we are exposed to the effect of changing price of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruption in supply of these commodity changing fuel and energy cost may have significant impact on our operation we require significant quantity of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicle and are exposed to the risk associated with variation in the market price for petroleum product including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel price through our indexed fuel surcharge and we may also enter into hedging transaction from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge higher fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge may result in mix shift from our higher yielding air product to lower yielding ground product or an overall reduction in volume there can be no assurance that our hedging transaction will be effective to protect from change in fuel price moreover we could experience disruption in energy supply including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel result of war action by producer or other factor beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business change in exchange rate or interest rate may have an adverse effect on our result we conduct business across the globe with significant portion of our revenue derived from operation outside the united state our operation in international market are affected by change in the exchange rate for local currency and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we are exposed to change in interest rate primarily on our short term debt and that portion of our long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting our debt is discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report additionally change in interest rate impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of change in interest rate on our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and cost is discussed further in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of this report we monitor and manage our exposure to change in currency exchange rate and interest rate and make use of derivative instrument to mitigate the impact of change in these rate on our financial position and result of operation however change in exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted or hedged if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customer service quality issue actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customer to use other company also adverse publicity surrounding labor relation environmental concern security matter political activity and the like or attempt to connect our company to these sort of issue either in the united state or other country in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our service by customer damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and result of operation and could require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand significant data breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business financial result or reputation and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security we rely heavily on information technology network and system including the internet to manage or support wide variety of important business process and activity throughout our operation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data our franchised center location and business we have acquired also are reliant on the use of information technology system to manage their business process and activity in addition the provision of service to our customer and the operation of our network and system involve the storage and transmission of significant amount of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customer employee and others to conduct our operation we regularly move data across national border and consequently we are subject to variety of continuously evolving and developing law and regulation in the united state and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security the scope of the law that may be applicable to is often uncertain and may be conflicting particularly with respect to foreign law for example the european union general data protection regulation gdpr which greatly increase the jurisdictional reach of european union law and add broad array of requirement for handling personal data including the public disclosure of significant data breach becomes effective in may other country have enacted or are enacting data localization law that require data to stay within their border all of these evolving compliance and operational requirement impose significant cost that are likely to increase over time our information technology system well those of our franchisees and acquired business may be susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to failure during the process of upgrading or replacing software database or component thereof power outage hardware failure computer virus cyber attack ransomware attack malware attack malicious employee or other insider telecommunication failure human error or catastrophic event hacker foreign government cyber terrorist and cyber criminal acting individually or in coordinated group may launch distributed denial of service attack or other coordinated attack that may cause service outage gain inappropriate or block legitimate access to system or information or result in other interruption in our business in addition breach in security could expose our customer and franchisees or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customer employee and others the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently may be difficult to detect for long time and often are not recognized until launched against target result we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure we also depend on and interact with the information technology network and system of third party for many aspect of our business operation including our customer and franchisees and service provider such cloud service provider and third party delivery service these third party may have access to information we maintain about our company operation customer employee and vendor or operating system that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operation like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach and cyber attack and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close their network or system security process protocol and standard that we have implemented and contractual provision requiring security measure that we may have sought to impose on such third party may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such event which could result in unauthorized access to or disruption or denial of access to or misuse of information or system that are important to our business including proprietary information sensitive or confidential data and other information about our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information any of these event that impact our information technology network or system or those of acquired business franchisees customer service provider or other third party could result in disruption in our operation the loss of existing or potential customer damage to our brand and reputation regulatory scrutiny and litigation and potential liability for the company among other consequence our customer confidence in our ability to protect data and system and to provide service consistent with their expectation could be impacted further disrupting our operation similarly an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable or foreign data protection regulation or other data protection standard may expose to litigation fine sanction or other penalty have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan the cost and operational consequence of implementing maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measure could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense complex and sophisticated global cyber threat despite our best effort we are not fully insulated from data breach and system disruption for example in august broad based malware intrusion targeting retailer throughout the wa discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately of our franchisees location while the impact of this cyber attack including the cost associated with investigation and remediation activity wa not material to our business and our financial result there is no assurance that such impact will not be material in the future and our effort to deter identify mitigate and or eliminate future breach may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster could adversely affect our business severe weather condition and other natural or manmade disaster including storm flood fire or earthquake epidemic or pandemic conflict or unrest or terrorist attack may result in decreased revenue our customer reduce their shipment or increased cost to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation for quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facility could result in significant interruption in or disruption of our business we make significant capital investment in our business of which significant portion is tied to projected volume level we require significant capital investment in our business consisting of aircraft vehicle technology facility and sorting and other type of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factor which are subject to uncertainty such general economic trend change in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment need we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenue and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirement we adjust other element of our operation and cost structure in response to adverse economic condition however these adjustment may not be sufficient to allow to maintain our operating margin in weak economy we derive significant portion of our revenue from our international operation and are subject to the risk of doing business in international market we have significant international operation and while the geographical diversity of our international operation help ensure that we are not overly reliant on single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social development that are beyond our control emerging market are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broad based downturn in these market could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we are subject to many law governing our international operation including those that prohibit improper payment to government official and commercial customer and restrict where we can do business our shipment to certain country and the information that we can provide to non government we are subject to change in market and our business plan that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial write down of the carrying value of our asset thereby reducing our net income our regular review of the carrying value of our asset ha resulted from time to time in significant impairment and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charge change in business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment of our intangible fixed or other asset at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charge if we determine that the useful life of our fixed asset or intangible asset are shorter than we originally estimated such change could reduce our net income employee health and retiree health and pension benefit cost represent significant expense to our expense relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefit are significant in recent year we have experienced significant increase in some of these cost largely result of economic factor beyond our control including in particular ongoing increase in healthcare cost well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rate that we use to value our benefit plan obligation continually increasing healthcare cost volatility in investment return and discount rate well change in law regulation and assumption used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expense may adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or require significant contribution to our benefit plan the national master agreement with the ibt includes change that are designed to mitigate certain of these healthcare expense but there can be no assurance that our effort will be successful or that the failure or success of these effort will not adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or liquidity participate in number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plan for employee covered under collective bargaining agreement part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit level we have agreed to contribute certain amount to the multiemployer benefit plan during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plan set benefit level and are responsible for benefit delivery to participant future contribution amount to multiemployer benefit plan will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contribution beyond the agreed upon amount except potential surcharge under the pension protection act of in the event that plan enters critical status and our contribution are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiation we could agree to make significantly higher future contribution to improve the funded status of one or more of these plan the funded status of these multiemployer plan is impacted by various factor including investment performance healthcare inflation change in demographic and change in participant benefit level at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contribution if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity could result from our participation in these plan in addition to our on going multiemployer pension plan obligation we may have additional exposure with respect to benefit earned in the central state pension fund the cspf ups wa contributing employer to the cspf until when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefit by paying billion withdrawal liability under collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamster ibt ups agreed to provide coordinating benefit in the ups ibt full time employee pension plan ups ibt plan for ups participant whose last employer wa ups and who had not retired of january the ups transfer group in the event that benefit are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the term of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf in december congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plan to reduce benefit payment to retiree subject to specific guideline in the statute and government approval in september the cspf submitted proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefit to the cspf participant including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it not comply with the law and that the cspf failed to comply with it contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefit to the ups transfer group under the term of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may the department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy number of requirement set forth in the mpra the cspf ha asserted that it will become insolvent in which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefit although there are numerous factor that could affect the cspf funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefit thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the ups ibt plan by approximately billion the cspf ha said that it belief legislative solution to it funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore option to avoid insolvency the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit from the ups ibt plan is subject to number of significant uncertainty including action that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these action include whether the cspf will submit revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefit are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal position well the effect of discount rate cspf asset return and various other actuarial assumption we account for this potential obligation under accounting standard codification topic compensation retirement benefit asc under asc we are required to provide best estimate of various actuarial assumption including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problem facing multiemployer pension plan is intervention by the federal government asc not permit anticipation of change in law in making best estimate of pension liability our best estimate of the measurement date of december doe not incorporate this solution however if future change in law resulted in an obligation to provide coordinating benefit under the ups ibt plan it may be significant event and may require to remeasure the plan asset and projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan at the date the law is enacted best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf solvency concern is that the cspf will submit another benefit suspension application under the mpra to forestall insolvency without reducing benefit to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempt to reduce benefit for the ups transfer group under mpra filing we would be in strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefit can not be reduced without our consent and such reduction without first exhausting reduction to other group in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate of the measurement date of december is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefit of the ups ibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase the uncertainty are resolved we will continue to ass the impact of these uncertainty on the projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan in accordance with asc we may have additional tax liability we are subject to income tax in the and many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain for example compliance with the united state tax cut and job act the tax act may require the collection of information not regularly produced within our company the use of provisional estimate in our financial statement and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for it provision many aspect of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time regulation and guidance evolve with respect to the tax act and we gather more information and perform more analysis our result may differ from previous estimate and may materially affect our financial position we regularly are under audit by tax authority in different jurisdiction economic and political pressure to increase tax revenue in various jurisdiction may make resolving tax dispute favorably more difficult although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable the final determination of tax audit and any related litigation in the jurisdiction where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income tax provision and accrual in addition change in federal and state or international tax law applicable to corporate multinationals other fundamental law change currently being considered by many country including in the and change in taxing jurisdiction administrative interpretation decision policy and position may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flow

service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationscritical accounting policy and estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based on our consolidated financial statement which are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america indicated in note to our consolidated financial statement the amount of asset liability revenue and expense reported in our financial statement are affected by estimate and judgment that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principle we base our estimate on prior experience and other assumption that we consider reasonable to our circumstance actual result could differ from our estimate which would affect the related amount reported in our consolidated financial statement while estimate and judgment are applied in arriving at many reported amount we believe that the following matter may involve higher degree of judgment and complexity contingenciesas discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement we are involved in various legal proceeding and contingency the event that may impact our contingent liability are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time contingency is identified we consider all relevant fact part of our evaluation we record liability for loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs from our previously estimated liability these factor could result in material difference between estimated and actual operating result contingent loss that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income tax and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or result of operation of and for the year ended december in addition we have certain contingent liability that have not been recognized of december because loss is not reasonably estimable goodwill and intangible impairmentwe perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting unit on an annual basis in our domestic package and international package reporting segment we have the following reporting unit europe asia america and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa in our supply chain freight segment we have the following reporting unit forwarding logistics ups mail innovation ups freight the ups store ups capital marken and coyote logistics during the third quarter of we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment testing from october to july this change better aligns the timing of the goodwill impairment test with our long term business planning process the change wa not material to our consolidated financial statement it did not result in the delay acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge our annual goodwill impairment testing date is july for each reporting unit owned at the testing date in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model dcf model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company appropriate the completion of the dcf model requires that we make number of significant assumption to produce an estimate of future cash flow these assumption include projection of future revenue cost capital expenditure and working capital change in addition we make assumption about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variable required in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit the projection that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition for each of our reporting unit the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves significant level of judgment in these assumption and change in our business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition could significantly impact these judgment we routinely monitor market condition and other factor to determine if interim impairment test are necessary if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsnone of the reporting unit incurred any goodwill impairment charge in or change in our forecast could cause carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed their fair value in future period potentially resulting in goodwill impairment charge during the year management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumption used during our annual goodwill impairment test for the period presented no triggering event were identified that required an interim impairment test based on most recent test the fair value of all our reporting unit substantially exceed their carrying value trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are considered to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized impairment test for indefinite lived intangible are performed on an annual basis we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method for the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds it fair value this valuation approach requires that we make number of assumption to estimate fair value these assumption include projection of future revenue market royalty rate tax rate discount rate and other relevant variable the projection we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition all of our remaining recorded intangible asset are deemed to be finite lived intangible and are thus amortized over their estimated useful life impairment test for these intangible asset are only performed when triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on dcf model if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation there were no impairment of any indefinite lived or finite lived intangible asset in or self insurance accrualswe self insure cost associated with worker compensation claim automotive liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well estimate of claim that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balance are based on reserve level which incorporate historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected level of cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of such reserve we believe our estimated reserve for such claim are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimate and affect our result of operation worker compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in healthcare cost and the result of related litigation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from previous actuarial projection change in state legislation with respect to worker compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accrual all of these factor can result in revision to prior actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result prior to outside actuarial study were performed semi annually and we used the study to estimate the liability in intervening quarter beginning in outside actuarial study are now performed quarterly we believe this provides with better quarterly estimate of our outstanding worker compensation liability we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee these liability and related expense are based on estimate of the number of employee and eligible dependent covered under the plan anticipated medical usage by participant and overall trend in medical cost and inflation actual experience may differ from these estimate and therefore produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationspension and postretirement medical benefitsour pension and other postretirement benefit cost are calculated using various actuarial assumption and methodology these assumption include discount rate healthcare cost trend rate inflation compensation increase rate expected return on plan asset mortality rate and other factor the assumption utilized in recording the obligation under our plan represent our best estimate and we believe that they are reasonable based on information to historical experience and performance well other factor that might cause future expectation to differ from past trend difference in actual experience or change in assumption may affect our pension and other postretirement obligation and future expense the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss each year are change in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligation of the measurement date difference between the expected and the actual return on plan asset change in demographic assumption including mortality participant experience different from demographic assumption and change in coordinating benefit with plan not sponsored by ups we recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and net actuarial gain or loss in excess of corridor

teamster ibt ups agreed to provide coordinating benefit in the ups ibt full time employee pension plan ups ibt plan for ups participant whose last employer wa ups and who had not retired of january the ups transfer group in the event that benefit are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the term of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf in december congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plan to reduce benefit payment to retiree subject to specific guideline in the statute and government approval in september the cspf submitted proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefit to the cspf participant including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and the cspf failed to comply with it contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefit to the ups transfer group under the term of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may the department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy number of requirement set forth in the mpra the cspf ha asserted that it will become insolvent in which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefit although there are numerous factor that could affect the cspf funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefit thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the ups ibt plan by approximately billion the cspf ha said that it belief legislative solution to it funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore option to avoid insolvency the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit from the ups ibt plan is subject to number of significant uncertainty including action that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these action include whether the cspf will submit revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefit are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal position well the effect of discount rate cspf asset return and various other actuarial assumption we account for this potential obligation under accounting standard codification topic compensation retirement benefit asc under asc we are required to provide best estimate of various actuarial assumption including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problem facing multiemployer pension plan is intervention by the federal government asc doe not permit anticipation of change in law in making best estimate of pension liability our best estimate of the measurement date of december doe not incorporate this solution however if future change in law resulted in an obligation to provide coordinating benefit under the ups ibt plan it may be significant event and may require to remeasure the plan asset and projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan at the date the law is enacted our best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf solvency concern is that the cspf will submit another benefit suspension application under the mpra to forestall insolvency without reducing benefit to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempt to reduce benefit for the ups transfer group under mpra filing we would be in strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefit can not be reduced without our consent and such reduction without first exhausting reduction to other group in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate of the measurement date of december is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefit of the ups ibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase the uncertainty are resolved we will continue to ass the impact of these uncertainty on the projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan in accordance with asc parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsdepreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assetsas of december we had billion of net fixed asset the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed asset we make estimate about the expected useful life and the expected residual value of the asset and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the asset and the cash flow generated by these asset in estimating the life and expected residual value of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft type subsequent revision to these estimate could be caused by change to our maintenance program change in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulation on aging aircraft and changing market price of new and used aircraft of the same or similar type we periodically evaluate these estimate and assumption and adjust the estimate and assumption necessary adjustment to the expected life and residual value are accounted for on prospective basis through depreciation expense in estimating cash flow we project future volume level for our different air express product in all geographic region in which we do business adverse change in these volume forecast or shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projection could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation could lead to an excess of particular aircraft resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or reduction of the expected life of an aircraft thus resulting in increased depreciation expense we review long lived asset for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal appropriate we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified the circumstance that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow loss associated with the use of the asset there were no impairment charge on our property plant and equipment during and fair value measurementsin the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instrument that contain element of market risk including derivative marketable security finance receivables pension asset other investment and debt certain of these financial instrument are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivative marketable security pension asset and certain other investment fair value are based on listed market price when such price are available to the extent that listed market price are not available fair value is determined based on other relevant factor including dealer price quotation certain financial instrument including over the counter derivative instrument are valued using pricing model that consider among other factor contractual and market price correlation time value credit spread and yield curve volatility factor change in the fixed income foreign exchange and commodity market will impact our estimate of fair value in the future potentially affecting our result of operation quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired customer technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsincome taxeswe make certain estimate and judgment in determining income tax expense for financial statement purpose these estimate and judgment occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credit benefit and deduction and in the calculation of deferred tax asset and liability which arise from difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose well tax interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position significant change to these estimate may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in subsequent period we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover substantial majority of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet however should there be change in our ability to recover our deferred tax asset our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery wa not likely the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from position filed or to be filed with the tax authority is recorded liability for uncertain tax benefit it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision see note to the audited consolidated financial statement for discussion of impact of the tax act parcel

sensitivity analysisthe following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instrument we utilize valuation model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate interest rate yield curve and commodity and equity price for option and instrument with non linear return model appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shift parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsthere are certain limitation inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rate change in parallel fashion and that interest rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario these estimate should not be viewed forecast we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive asset and liability in response to change in market condition additionally change in the fair value of foreign currency derivative and commodity derivative are offset by change in the cash flow of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transaction shock test result of december in million in fair value currency

the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal appropriate we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified goodwill and intangible assetscosts of purchased business in excess of net identifiable asset acquired goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually unless change in circumstance indicate an impairment may have occurred sooner we are required to test goodwill on reporting unit basis reporting unit is the operating segment unless for business within that operating segment discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management in which case such component business is the reporting unit during the third quarter of we changed the measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test from october to july this change better aligns the timing of the goodwill impairment test with our long term business planning process the change wa not material to our consolidated financial statement it did not result in the delay acceleration or avoidance of an impairment charge parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsin assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we consider several factor including macroeconomic condition industry and market condition overall financial performance of the reporting unit change in management strategy or customer and relevant reporting unit specific event such change in the carrying amount of net asset more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all or portion of reporting unit and the testing for recoverability of significant asset group within reporting unit if this qualitative assessment result in conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds the carrying value then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it calculated fair value then the second step is performed and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company appropriate trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are considered to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized indefinite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment at least annually we determined that the income approach specifically the relief from royalty method is the most appropriate valuation method to estimate the fair value of the trade name the estimated fair value of the trade name is compared to the carrying value of the asset if the carrying value of the trade name exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds it fair value finite lived intangible asset including trademark license patent customer list non compete agreement and franchise right are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset which range from to year capitalized software is generally amortized over year self insurance accrualswe self insure cost associated with worker compensation claim automotive liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well estimate of claim that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balance are based on reserve level which incorporate historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected level of cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of such reserve worker compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in healthcare cost and the result of related litigation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from previous actuarial projection change in state legislation with respect to worker compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accrual all of these factor can result in revision to prior actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result prior to outside actuarial study were performed semi annually and we used the study to estimate the liability in intervening quarter beginning in outside actuarial study are now performed quarterly we believe this provides with better quarterly estimate of our outstanding worker compensation liability we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee these liability and related expense are based on estimate of the number of employee and eligible dependent covered under the plan anticipated medical usage by participant and overall trend in medical cost and inflation pension and postretirement benefitswe incur certain employment related expense associated with pension and postretirement medical benefit these pension and postretirement medical benefit cost for company sponsored benefit plan are calculated using various actuarial assumption and methodology including discount rate expected return on plan asset healthcare cost trend rate inflation compensation increase rate mortality rate and coordination of benefit with plan not sponsored by ups actuarial assumption are reviewed on an annual basis unless circumstance require an interim remeasurement for any of our plan parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementswe recognize change in the fair value of

each year the remaining component of pension expense primarily service and interest cost and the expected return on plan asset are recorded on quarterly basis effective july the ups retirement plan wa closed to new non union participant for eligible employee hired after july ups contributes annually to defined contribution plan we recognize expense for the required contribution quarterly and we recognize liability for any contribution due and unpaid included in other current liability during june we amended the ups retirement plan and excess coordinating plan to cease accrual of additional benefit for future service for non union participant effective january we remeasured plan asset and pension benefit obligation compensation for the affected pension plan of june to recognize the impact of this change we participate in number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plan for employee covered under collective bargaining agreement our contribution to these plan are determined in accordance with the respective collective bargaining agreement we recognize expense for the contractually required contribution for each period and we recognize liability for any contribution due and unpaid included in other current liability income taxesincome tax are accounted for on an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statement or tax return in estimating future tax consequence we generally consider all expected future event other than proposed change in the tax law or rate valuation allowance are provided if it is more likely than not that deferred tax asset will not be realized we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any once it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement the difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from position filed or to be filed with the tax authority is recorded liability for uncertain tax benefit it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit atctivity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in january the fasb released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low taxed income gilti provision of the tax cut and job act the tax act the gilti provision impose tax on foreign income in excess of deemed return on tangible asset of foreign corporation the guidance indicates that either accounting for deferred tax related to gilti inclusion or treating any tax on gilti inclusion period cost are both acceptable method subject to an accounting policy election we elect to treat any potential gilti

service condition where the award cliff vest or vest ratably over three or five year period the nominal vesting period or at the date the employee retires defined by the plan if earlier compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for award granted to retirement eligible employee or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period we estimate forfeiture rate based on historical rate of forfeiture for award with similar characteristic historical rate of employee turnover and the nature and term of the vesting condition of the award we reevaluate our forfeiture rate on an annual basis fair value measurementsour financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis have been categorized based upon fair value hierarchy level input utilize quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input are based on other observable market data such quoted price for similar asset and liability and input other than quoted price that are observable such interest rate and yield curve level input are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumption and include situation where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability certain non financial asset and liability are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis including property plant and equipment goodwill and intangible asset these asset are not measured at fair value on recurring basis however they are subject to fair value adjustment in certain circumstance such when there is evidence of an impairment general description of the valuation methodology used for asset and liability measured at fair value including the general classification of such asset and liability pursuant to the valuation hierarchy is included in each footnote with fair value measurement present we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired customer acquired technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings derivative instrumentsall financial derivative instrument are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value derivative not designated hedge must be adjusted to fair value through income if derivative is designated hedge change in it fair value that are considered to be effective defined either depending on the nature of the hedge offset the change in fair value of the hedged asset liability or firm commitment through income or are recorded in aoci until the hedged item is recorded in income any portion of change

security are generally amortized over the contractual life of the security only in case when an entity ha large number of similar security is it allowed to consider estimate of principal prepayment amortization of the premium over the contractual life of the instrument can result in loss being recorded for the unamortized premium if the issuer exercise the call feature prior to maturity the

at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those good or service the fasb ha also issued number of update to this standard we adopted the standard on january company may use either full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard we adopted the standard using full retrospective approach we have determined that revenue recognition will be accelerated for the transportation business the standard requires revenue to be recognized control is transferred to the customer over time rather than upon delivery we have determined that the impact of this change to the statement of consolidated income is not material the standard also requires to evaluate whether our business promise to transfer service to the customer principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party an agent to make that determination the standard us control model rather than the risk and reward model in current gaap based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that certain supply chain freight business act the principal rather than the agent within their revenue arrangement this change will require the affected business to report transportation revenue gross of associated purchased transportation cost rather than net of such amount within the statement of consolidated income this change will result in reclassification of approximately and million from contra revenue to operating expense on the statement of consolidated income for the period ended december and respectively in addition to

rate is used to determine the present value of our future benefit obligation to determine the discount rate for our pension and postretirement benefit plan we use bond matching approach to select

soa published mortality table and improvement scale are used in developing the best estimate of mortality for plan in october the soa published an updated improvement scale which reduced expected mortality improvement from previously published scale based on our perspective of future longevity we updated the mortality assumption to incorporate this updated scale for purpose of measuring pension and other postretirement benefit obligation assumption for the expected return on plan asset are used to determine component of net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year the assumption for our plan is developed using long term projection of return for each asset class our asset allocation target are reviewed and if necessary updated taking into consideration plan change funded status and actual performance the expected return for each asset class is function of passive long term capital market assumption and excess return generated from active management the capital market assumption used are provided by independent investment advisor while excess return assumption are supported by historical performance fund mandate and investment expectation for plan outside the consideration is given to local market expectation of long term return strategic asset allocation are determined by plan based on the nature of liability and considering the demographic composition of the plan participant actuarial assumption central state pension fundups wa contributing employer to the central state pension fund cspf until when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefit by paying billion withdrawal liability under collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of teamster ibt ups agreed to provide coordinating benefit in the ups ibt full time employee pension plan ups ibt plan for ups participant whose last employer wa ups and who had not retired of january the ups transfer group in the event that benefit are lawfully reduced by the cspf in the future consistent with the term of our withdrawal agreement with the cspf in december congress passed the multiemployer pension reform act mpra which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plan to reduce benefit payment to retiree subject to specific guideline in the statute and government approval in september the cspf submitted proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the department of the treasury under the mpra the cspf plan proposed to reduce retirement benefit to the cspf participant including the ups transfer group we vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and that the cspf failed to comply with it contractual obligation to obtain our consent to reduce benefit to the ups transfer group under the term of the withdrawal agreement with the cspf on may the department of the treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the cspf stating that it failed to satisfy number of requirement set forth in the mpra the cspf ha asserted that it will become insolvent in which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefit although there are numerous factor that could affect the cspf funding status if the cspf were to become insolvent they have projected ups may be required to provide coordinating benefit thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the ups ibt plan by approximately billion the cspf ha said that it belief legislative solution to it funding status is necessary and we expect that the cspf will continue to explore option to avoid insolvency the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefit from the ups ibt plan is subject to number of significant uncertainty including action that may be taken by the cspf the federal government or others these action include whether the cspf will submit revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance the extent to which benefit are paid by the pension benefit guaranty corporation our ability to successfully defend our legal position well the effect of discount rate cspf asset return and various other actuarial assumption we account for this potential obligation under accounting standard codification topic compensation retirement benefit asc under asc we are required to provide best estimate of various actuarial assumption including the eventual outcome of this matter in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the december measurement date while we currently believe the most likely solution to this matter and the broader systemic problem facing multiemployer pension plan is intervention by the federal government asc doe not permit anticipation of change in law in making best estimate of pension liability our best estimate of the measurement date of december doe not incorporate this solution however if future change in law resulted in an obligation to provide coordinating benefit under the ups ibt plan it may be significant event and may require to remeasure the plan asset and projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan at the date the law is enacted parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsour best estimate of the next most likely outcome to resolve the cspf solvency concern is that the cspf will submit another benefit suspension application under the mpra to forestall insolvency without reducing benefit to the ups transfer group if the cspf attempt to reduce benefit for the ups transfer group under mpra filing we would be in strong legal position to prevent that from occurring given that these benefit can not be reduced without our consent and such reduction without first exhausting reduction to other group in the cspf would be contrary to the statute accordingly our best estimate of the measurement date of december is that there is no liability to be recognized for additional coordinating benefit of the ups ibt plan however the projected benefit obligation could materially increase the uncertainty are resolved we will continue to ass the impact of these uncertainty on the projected benefit obligation of the ups ibt plan in accordance with asc other actuarial assumptionshealthcare cost trend are used to project future postretirement medical benefit payable from our plan for year
