combination industry overviewthe retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industry across the globe are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent year prescription drug play significant role in healthcare and constitute first line of treatment for many medical condition we believe the long term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due in part to aging population increase in life expectancy increase in the availability and utilization of generic drug the continued development of innovative drug that improve quality of life and control healthcare cost and increase in the number of person with insurance coverage for prescription drug including in the united state baby boomer increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded medicare part prescription program pharmaceutical wholesaler act vital link between drug manufacturer and pharmacy and healthcare provider in supplying pharmaceutical to patient the retail pharmacy industry across the globe relies significantly on private and governmental third party payer many private organization throughout the healthcare industry including pharmacy benefit management pbm company and health insurance company have consolidated in recent year to create larger healthcare enterprise with greater bargaining power third party payer including the medicare part plan and the state sponsored medicaid and related managed care medicaid agency in the united state can change eligibility requirement or reduce certain reimbursement rate in addition in many european country the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumer and regulates pharmaceutical price patient eligibility and reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system change in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rate and term for example the patient protection and affordable care act the table of content aca wa enacted to help control federal healthcare spending including for prescription drug in the united state and the uk department of health plan to implement funding cut to reduce cost within the national health service by reducing drug reimbursement rate these change generally are expected to reduce medicaid reimbursement in the united state and pharmacy reimbursement in the uk state medicaid program are also expected to continue to seek reduction in reimbursement third party payer or governmental authority take action that restrict eligibility or reduce price or reimbursement rate sale and margin in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced which would adversely affect industry profitability in case these possible adverse effect may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory cost and other expense dispensing more higher margin generic finding new revenue stream through pharmacy service or other offering and or dispensing greater volume of prescription generic prescription drug have continued to help lower overall cost for customer and third party payer we expect the utilization of generic pharmaceutical to continue to increase in general in the united state generic version of drug generate lower sale dollar per prescription higher gross profit dollar compared with patent protected brand name drug the impact on retail pharmacy gross profit dollar can be significant in the first several month after generic version of drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version which is generally referred to generic conversion in any given year the number of major brand name drug that undergo conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversion can be difficult to predict which can have significant impact on retail pharmacy sale and gross profit dollar we expect that market demand government regulation third party reimbursement policy government contracting requirement and other pressure will continue to cause the industry in which we compete to evolve pharmacist are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system and we believe rising healthcare cost and the limited supply of primary care physician present new opportunity for pharmacist and retail pharmacy to play an even greater role in driving positive outcome for patient and payer through expanded service offering such immunization and other preventive care healthcare clinic

generic and the rate at which new generic drug are introduced to the market any number of factor outside of our control can affect timing for generic conversion we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversion will occur and effect they will have on particular future period the current environment of our pharmacy business also includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and shift in pharmacy mix towards day at retail one prescription that is the equivalent of three day prescription and medicare part prescription further consolidation among generic manufacturer coupled with change in the number of major brand name drug anticipated to undergo conversion from branded to generic status may also result in gross margin pressure within the industry we continuously face

that we face our business operation could also be affected by additional factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial reduction in third party reimbursement level from private or governmental agency plan and potential change in industry pricing benchmark for prescription drug could materially and adversely affect our result of operation the substantial majority of the prescription we fill are reimbursed by third party payer including private and governmental agency payer the continued effort of health maintenance organization managed care organization pbm company governmental agency and other third party payer to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate well litigation and other legal proceeding relating to drug are priced may adversely impact our result of operation in the united state plan change with rate adjustment often occur in january and our reimbursement arrangement may provide for rate adjustment at prescribed interval during their term in addition in an environment where some pbm client utilize narrow or restricted pharmacy provider network some of these entity may offer pricing term that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their network of pharmacy provider change in political economic and regulatory influence also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practice in the united state for example there have been multiple attempt through legislative action and legal challenge to repeal or amend the aca in whole and in part we can not predict whether current or future effort to repeal or amend these law will be successful can we predict the impact that such repeal or amendment and any subsequent legislation would have on our business and reimbursement level there have also been number of other proposal and enactment by the federal government and various state to reduce medicare part and medicaid reimbursement level in response to budget deficit and we expect additional proposal in the future there can be no assurance that recent or future change in prescription drug reimbursement policy and practice will not materially and adversely affect our result of operation in many country where we have operation the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumer and regulates pharmaceutical price patient eligibility and reimbursement level to control cost for the government sponsored healthcare system effort to control healthcare cost including prescription drug cost are continuous and reduction in third party reimbursement level could materially and adversely affect our result of operation in addition many payer in the united state are increasingly considering new metric the basis for reimbursement rate such average sale price average manufacturer price and actual acquisition cost it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price which is the pricing reference used for many of our contract in addition many state medicaid fee for service program moved to establish pharmacy network payment on the basis of actual acquisition cost by april which potentially could have an impact on reimbursement practice in other commercial and government arrangement future change to the pricing benchmark used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payer could adversely affect shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plan and program could adversely affect our result of operation our retail pharmacy usa division seek to grow prescription volume while operating in marketplace with continuous reimbursement pressure shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our result of operation for example our retail pharmacy usa division ha experienced shift in pharmacy mix towards day at retail in recent year our day at retail offering for patient with chronic prescription table of contentsneeds typically is at lower margin than comparable day prescription our retail pharmacy usa division also experienced shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription in fiscal and that trend may continue preferred medicare part network have increased in number in recent year however we do not participate in all such network we have accepted lower reimbursement rate in order to secure preferred relationship with medicare part plan serving senior patient with significant pharmacy need we also have worked to develop and expand our relationship with commercial third party payer to enable new and or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider network they offer if we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patient participating in these program that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement or if the degree or term of our participation in such preferred network decline from current level in future year our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we could be adversely affected by decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drug well increase in the cost to procure prescription drug the profitability of our pharmacy business depends upon the utilization of prescription drug utilization trend are affected by among other factor the introduction of new and successful prescription drug well lower priced generic alternative to existing brand name drug inflation in the price of drug also can adversely affect utilization particularly given the increased prevalence of high deductible health insurance plan and related plan design change new brand name drug can result in increased drug utilization and associated sale while the introduction of lower priced generic alternative typically result in relatively lower sale but relatively higher gross profit margin accordingly decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drug or generic successfully introduced delay in their introduction or decrease in the utilization of previously introduced prescription drug could materially and adversely affect our result of operation in addition if we experience an increase in the amount we pay to procure pharmaceutical drug including generic drug it could have material adverse effect on our result of operation our gross profit margin would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increase any failure to fully offset any such increased price and cost or to modify our activity to mitigate the impact could have material adverse effect on our result of operation additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our expectation we derive significant portion of our sale in the united state from prescription drug sale reimbursed by limited number of pharmacy benefit management company we derive significant portion of our sale in the united state from prescription drug sale reimbursed through prescription drug plan administered by limited number of pbm company pbm company typically administer multiple prescription drug plan that expire at various time and provide for varying reimbursement rate and often limit coverage to specific drug product on an approved list known formulary which might not include all of the approved drug for particular indication there can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular pbm company pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period if our participation in the pharmacy provider network for prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large pbm company is restricted or terminated we expect that our sale would be adversely affected at least in the short term if we are unable to replace any such lost sale either through an increase in other sale or through resumption of participation in those plan our operating result could be materially and adversely affected if we exit pharmacy provider network and later resume participation there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace or that all client of the pbm company will choose to include in the pharmacy network for their plan initially or at all in addition in such circumstance we may incur increased marketing and other cost in connection with initiative to regain former patient and attract new patient covered by such plan consolidation and strategic alliance in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operation competitive positioning financial condition and result of operation many organization in the healthcare industry including pbm company have consolidated in recent year to create larger healthcare enterprise with greater bargaining power which ha resulted in greater pricing pressure if this consolidation trend continues it could give the resulting enterprise even greater bargaining power which may lead to further pressure on the price for our product and service if these pressure result in reduction in our price our business would become le profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reduction in cost or develop profitable new revenue stream new partnership and strategic alliance in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamic and impact our business and competitive positioning for example following the entry into our strategic relationship with amerisourcebergen providing for among other thing generic drug purchasing through our global sourcing enterprise some of our retail pharmacy competitor subsequently established relationship with other pharmaceutical drug wholesaler and others relating to generic drug procurement change in the participant in such global sourcing enterprise whether result of merger acquisition table of contentsor other transaction can have similar effect in addition further consolidation among generic drug manufacturer could lead to generic drug inflation in the future we expect that market demand government regulation third party reimbursement policy government contracting requirement and other pressure will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve potentially resulting in further business consolidation and alliance and increased vertical integration among the industry participant we engage with and which could if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry condition in timely and effective manner materially and adversely impact our business operation financial condition and result of operation our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisition joint venture and other strategic alliance significant element of our growth strategy is to identify pursue and successfully complete acquisition joint venture and other strategic alliance that either expand or complement our existing operation we have grown significantly through acquisition in recent year and expect to continue to acquire partner with or invest in business that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing business or further our strategic objective due in part to consolidation in the industry in which we compete there is significant competition for attractive target and opportunity when available there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunity will be available that we will be successful in identifying negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunity or that any such transaction we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resource therein acquisition and other strategic transaction involve numerous risk including difficulty in successfully integrating the operation and personnel distraction of management from overseeing and disruption of our existing operation difficulty in entering market or line of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience the possible loss of key employee and customer and difficulty in achieving the synergy we anticipated any failure to select suitable opportunity at fair price conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company including particularly when acquired business operate in new geographic market or area of business could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and result of operation these transaction may also cause to significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholder percentage ownership or incur asset write offs and restructuring cost and other related expense that could have material adverse impact on our operating result acquisition joint venture and strategic investment also involve numerous other risk including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liability well undetected internal control regulatory or other issue or additional cost not anticipated at the time the transaction wa completed no assurance can be given that our acquisition joint venture and other strategic alliance will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operation financial condition or result of operation if we are unable to successfully identify complete and integrate acquisition joint venture and strategic investment in timely and effective manner our business operation and growth strategy could be negatively affected our strategic relationship include outsourcing and similar relationship we outsource certain business and administrative function and rely on third party to perform certain service on our behalf for example in july we announced binding offer from fareva for year global agreement for the manufacture and supply of own beauty brand and private label product under the term of the proposed agreement fareva will take ownership of bcm walgreens boot alliance contract manufacturing business which operates factory in the united kingdom france and germany the proposed agreement which is subject to certain closing condition is expected to be completed by the end of calendar year we rely on these third party to meet our quality and performance requirement and to timely perform expected we periodically negotiate provision and renewal of these relationship and there can be no assurance that such term will remain acceptable to or such third party if our continuing relationship with certain third party provider is interrupted or if such third party provider experience disruption or do not perform anticipated or we experience problem with any transition we may experience operational difficulty reputational harm and increased cost that could materially and adversely affect our business operation and result of operation we may not be able to successfully or timely complete the acquisition of certain rite aid asset risk and uncertainty related to our acquisition of store three distribution center and related inventory from rite aid pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement include among others the occurrence of any event change or other circumstance that could impact our ability to complete the closing condition set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement including that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay completion of the transaction and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect relationship with supplier payer customer and other third party while we have completed the acquisition of the first few rite aid store pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement of the date of this report ownership of store is expected to be transferred in phase with the table of contentsgoal being to complete the store transfer in spring completion of the remaining asset acquisition transaction is subject to the satisfaction of the applicable condition set forth in the amended and restated asset purchase agreement we will be unable to complete the acquisition of these rite aid asset each of the condition to closing is either satisfied or waived we have incurred and will continue to incur significant cost expense and fee for professional service and other transaction cost in connection with the transaction well the diversion of management resource for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the remaining asset acquisition do not occur we may not realize the anticipated benefit of the acquisition of certain rite aid asset pursuant to the amended and restated asset purchase agreement which could adversely impact our result of operation we entered into the amended and restated asset purchase agreement to acquire certain rite aid store and distribution center with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefit including among other thing cost saving and operating efficiency the achievement of the anticipated benefit of the transaction is subject to number of uncertainty including whether the acquired asset can be integrated into our business in an efficient and effective manner the possibility of faulty assumption underlying expectation regarding potential synergy and the integration process unforeseen expense or delay and competitive factor in the marketplace we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefit of the transaction including cost saving and synergy will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all the cost or difficulty related to the integration of the acquired asset into our business and operation will not be greater than expected unanticipated cost charge and expense will not result from the transaction litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed and the transaction will not cause disruption to the party business and operation and relationship with employee and supplier payer customer and other third party if one or more of these risk are realized it could have material adverse impact on our operating result we could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration related cost or other circumstance such unforeseen liability or other issue resulting from the transaction many of these potential circumstance are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased cost decreased revenue decreased synergy and the diversion of management time and attention which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunity and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic action if we are unable to achieve our objective within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefit may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have material adverse impact on our business operation financial condition and result of operation in addition we have incurred significant transaction cost related to the transaction and expect to continue to incur significant integration and related cost we integrate the acquired rite aid asset these integration and acquisition related cost including legal accounting financial and tax advisory and other fee and cost may be higher than expected and some of these cost may be material our substantial international business operation subject to number of operating economic political regulatory and other international business risk our substantial international business operation are important to our growth and prospect including particularly those of our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale division and are subject to number of risk including compliance with wide variety of foreign law and regulation including retail and wholesale pharmacy licensing tax foreign trade intellectual property privacy and data protection immigration currency political and other business restriction and requirement and local law and regulation whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdiction and can change significantly over time additional and other regulation of non domestic operation including regulation under the foreign corrupt practice act the bribery act and other anti corruption law potential difficulty in managing foreign operation mitigating credit risk in foreign market enforcing agreement and collecting receivables through foreign legal system price control imposed by foreign country tariff duty or other restriction on foreign currency or trade sanction and other trade barrier imposed by foreign country that restrict or prohibit business transaction in certain market potential adverse tax consequence including tax withholding law and policy and restriction on repatriation of fund to the united state table of content fluctuation in currency exchange rate impact of recession and economic slowdown in economy outside the united state including foreign currency devaluation higher interest rate inflation and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private business the instability of foreign economy government and currency and unexpected regulatory economic or political change in foreign market and developing and emerging market may be especially vulnerable to period of instability and unexpected change and consumer in those market may have relatively limited resource to spend on product and service these factor can also adversely affect our payer vendor and customer in international market which in turn can negatively impact our business we can not assure you that one or more of these factor will not have material adverse effect on our business operation result of operation and financial condition many of these factor are subject to change based on change in political economic and regulatory influence for example our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale division have substantial operation in the united kingdom and other member country of the european union on june voter in the united kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the european union which proposed exit and the political economic and other uncertainty it ha raised ha exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risk and uncertainty described negotiation on withdrawal and post exit arrangement likely will be complex and protracted and there can be no assurance regarding the term timing or consummation of any such arrangement the proposed withdrawal could among other potential outcome adversely affect the tax tax treaty currency operational legal and regulatory regime to which our business in the region are subject the withdrawal could also among other potential outcome disrupt the free movement of good service and people between the united kingdom and the european union and significantly disrupt trade between the united kingdom and the european union and other party further uncertainty around these and related issue could lead to adverse effect on the economy of the united kingdom and the other economy in which we operate many of the product we sell are manufactured in whole or in part outside of the united state in some case these product are imported by others and sold to following the november election in the united state the new administration ha discussed or sought to implement change with respect to certain tax and trade policy tariff and other government regulation affecting trade between the united state and other country while it is not possible to predict whether or when any such change will occur or what form they may take significant change in tax or trade policy tariff or trade relation between the united state and other country could result in significant increase in our cost restrict our access to certain supplier and adversely impact economic activity in addition other country may change their business and trade policy in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariff and other change in united state trade policy and regulation there can be no assurance that any or all of these development will not have material adverse effect on our business operation result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation our significant operation outside of the united state expose to currency exchange rate fluctuation and related risk including transaction currency exposure relating to the import and export of good in currency other than business functional currency well currency translation exposure relating to profit and net asset denominated in currency other than the dollar we present our financial statement in dollar and have significant proportion of net asset and income in non dollar currency primarily the british pound sterling and the euro well range of other foreign currency our result of operation and capital ratio can therefore be sensitive to movement in foreign exchange rate due to the constantly changing currency exposure to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rate we can not predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuation upon our future result of operation in addition fluctuation in currency relative to the dollar may make it more difficult to perform period to period comparison of our reported result of operation depreciation of non dollar currency relative to the dollar could have significant adverse impact on our result of operation table of contentswe may from time to time in some instance enter into foreign currency contract or other derivative instrument intended to hedge portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risk which subject to additional risk such the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligation to that could materially and adversely affect additionally we may and currently do use foreign currency borrowing to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risk the periodic use of such hedging activity may not offset any or more than portion of the adverse financial effect of unfavorable movement in foreign exchange rate over the limited time the hedge are in place we can not assure you that fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate including particularly the strengthening of the dollar major currency or the currency of large developing country will not materially affect our consolidated financial result our business result depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and business transformation and achieve cost saving and operating efficiency initiative our board of director approved the plan to implement the store optimization program described in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in part ii item below part of an initiative to reduce cost and increase operating efficiency there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefit of this program our financial goal assume level of productivity improvement including those reflected in the store optimization program and other business optimization initiative if we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvement while continuing to invest in business growth or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resource our business operation and financial result could be materially and adversely impacted our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiative and realize expected saving and benefit in the amount and at the time anticipated is important to our business success any failure to do which could result from our inability to successfully execute organizational change and business transformation plan change in global or regional economic condition competition change in the industry in which we compete unanticipated cost or charge loss of key personnel and other factor described herein could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our business the product we sell are sourced from wide variety of domestic and international vendor and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendor and access product that meet requisite quality and safety standard in timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our business the loss or disruption of such supply arrangement for any reason including for issue such labor dispute loss or impairment of key manufacturing site inability to procure sufficient raw material quality control issue ethical sourcing issue supplier financial distress natural disaster civil unrest or act of war or terrorism trade sanction or other external factor over which we have no control could interrupt product supply and if not effectively managed and remedied have material adverse impact on our business operation financial condition and result of operation we use single wholesaler of branded and generic pharmaceutical drug our primary source of such product for our retail pharmacy usa division in march walgreens alliance boot and amerisourcebergen announced various agreement and arrangement including ten year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and amerisourcebergen pursuant to which we source branded and generic pharmaceutical product from amerisourcebergen in the and an agreement which provides amerisourcebergen the ability to access generic pharmaceutical product through our global sourcing enterprise in may certain of these agreement were extended for three year to now expire in in addition in march walgreens alliance boot and amerisourcebergen entered into agreement and arrangement pursuant to which we have the right but not the obligation to purchase minority equity position in amerisourcebergen and gain associated representation on amerisourcebergen board of director in certain circumstance of the date of this report amerisourcebergen distributes for our retail pharmacy usa division substantially all branded and generic pharmaceutical product consequently our business in the united state may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulty that amerisourcebergen experience for example if amerisourcebergen operation are seriously disrupted for any reason whether due to natural disaster labor disruption regulatory action computer or operational system or otherwise it could adversely affect our business in the united state and our result of operation our distribution agreement with amerisourcebergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstance and upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or amerisourcebergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into new agreement on term favorable to or at all if such expiration or termination occurred we believe that alternative source of supply for most generic and brand name pharmaceutical are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative source which may include self distribution in some case for substantially all of the prescription drug we sell on an acceptable basis such that the impact of any such expiration or termination would be table of contentstemporary however there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply source or implement self distribution process on timely basis or on term favorable to or effectively manage these transition any of which could adversely affect our business operation financial condition and result of operation the anticipated strategic and financial benefit of our relationship with amerisourcebergen may not be realized we entered into the arrangement with amerisourcebergen with the expectation that the transaction contemplated thereby would result in various benefit including among other thing procurement cost saving and operating efficiency innovation and sharing of best practice the process and initiative needed to achieve these potential benefit are complex costly and time consuming many of the anticipated synergy and expense that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefit from the arrangement is subject to number of significant challenge and uncertainty including the possibility of faulty assumption underlying expectation process or initiative or the inability to realize and or delay in realizing potential benefit and synergy whether unique corporate culture of separate organization will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner unforeseen expense or delay and competitive factor in the marketplace of august we beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding amerisourcebergen common stock and had designated one member of amerisourcebergen board of director in addition we have the right but not the obligation under the transaction contemplated by the framework agreement dated of march by and among the company alliance boot and amerisourcebergen the framework agreement to acquire up to an additional amerisourcebergen share in the open market and thereafter designate another member of amerisourcebergen board of director subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirement there can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investment in amerisourcebergen or that our existing investment or any future investment if completed will ultimately be profitable if the price of amerisourcebergen common stock subsequently decline substantially we could experience loss on or impairment of such investment which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation further our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen security is subject to certain restriction set forth in our agreement with amerisourcebergen and arising under applicable law and regulation which in some circumstance could adversely our ability to transact in amerisourcebergen security in amount and at the time desired we could also encounter unforeseen cost circumstance or issue existing or arising with respect to the transaction and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework agreement many of these potential circumstance are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased cost decreased revenue decreased synergy and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objective within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefit may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have material adverse impact on our business operation financial condition and result of operation from time to time we make investment in company over which we do not have sole control some of these company may operate in sector that differ from our current operation and have different risk from time to time we make debt or equity investment in company that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control for example while we have significant equity investment in amerisourcebergen and have designee serving on the board of director of amerisourcebergen of the date of this report we do not have the ability to control day to day operation of that company although the business in which we have made non controlling investment often have significant health and daily living or prescription drug component some of them operate in business that are different from our primary line of business and or operate in different geographic market than we do investment in these business among other risk subject to the operating and financial risk of the business we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operation of these business we rely on the internal control and financial reporting control of these entity and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standard may materially and adversely affect investment in entity over which we do not have sole control including joint venture and strategic alliance present additional risk such having differing objective from our partner or the entity in which we are invested becoming involved in dispute or competing with those person from time to time we may make additional investment in or acquire other entity that may subject to similar risk change in economic condition could adversely affect consumer buying practice our performance ha been and may continue to be adversely impacted by change in global national regional or local economic condition and consumer confidence these condition can also adversely affect our key vendor and customer external factor that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rate inflation level of personal disposable income level of tax and interest and global national regional or local economic condition well act of war or terrorism change in economic condition and consumer confidence could adversely table of contentsaffect consumer preference purchasing power and spending pattern which could lead to decrease in overall consumer spending well in prescription drug and health service utilization and which could be exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health insurance plan and related plan design change in addition reduced or flat consumer spending may drive and our competitor to offer additional product at promotional price all of these factor could materially and adversely impact our business operation financial condition and result of operation economic condition in europe and certain emerging market country together with austerity measure being taken by certain government could adversely affect we have significant asset and operation within europe and certain emerging market country in our retail pharmacy international and pharmaceutical wholesale division an economic slowdown within any such market could adversely affect our business in affected region by reducing the price our customer may be able or willing to pay for our product and service or by reducing the demand for our product and service either of which could result in material adverse impact on our result of operation in recent year in response to the economic environment number of government including the government in the united kingdom have announced or implemented austerity measure to reduce healthcare spending for the government sponsored healthcare system and constrain overall government expenditure these measure which include effort aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare cost continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timeline for pharmaceutical drug country with existing austerity measure may impose additional law regulation or requirement on the healthcare industry in addition government that have not yet imposed austerity measure may impose them in the future any new austerity measure may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measure and could have material adverse effect on our international business operation and result of operation the industry in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving new entrant to the market existing competitor action or other change in market dynamic could adversely impact the level of competition in the retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industry is high change in market dynamic or action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance could materially and adversely impact disruptive innovation by existing or new competitor could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require to accurately identify and ass such change and make timely and effective change to our strategy and business model to compete effectively our retail pharmacy business face intense competition from local regional national and global company including other drugstore and pharmacy chain independent drugstore and pharmacy mail order pharmacy and various other retailer such grocery store convenience store mass merchant online and omni channel pharmacy and retailer warehouse club dollar store and other discount merchandiser some of which are aggressively expanding in market we serve business in our pharmaceutical wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitor including national and regional cooperative wholesaler and alternative supply source such importer and manufacturer who supply directly to pharmacy competition may also come from other source in the future competition increase in the market in which we operate significant increase in general pricing pressure could occur which could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive for example if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to change in market condition in our pharmaceutical wholesale division including change driven by competitor supplier or manufacturer and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesaler it could result in loss of customer or renewal of contract or arrangement on le favorable term we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in market dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united state significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication many of which are made available by manufacturer to limited number of pharmacy so called limited distribution drug that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of this business depends to significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drug and successfully penetrate key treatment category to better serve this evolving market on march we and prime therapeutic llc pbm closed transaction to form combined central specialty pharmacy and mail service company

function designed we may experience loss of customer confidence data security breach lost sale or be exposed to fraudulent purchase any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operation reputation and result of operation if the merchandise and service that we offer fail to meet customer need our sale may be adversely affected we could be adversely affected by change in

service we sell or our customer purchasing habit and taste we may be faced with excess inventory of some product and missed opportunity for product and service we chose not to offer in addition our sale may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower price failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer taste preference and spending pattern and evolving demographic mix in the market we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customer and the demand for our product and service which could materially and adversely impact our result of operation our private brand offering expose to various additional risk in addition to brand name product we offer our customer private brand product that are not available from other retailer we seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offering part of our growth strategy including through the expanded offering of and other brand owned or licensed on an exclusive basis well through selective acquisition maintaining consistent product quality competitive pricing and availability of our private brand offering for our customer well the timely development and introduction of new product is important in differentiating from other retailer and developing and maintaining customer loyalty although we believe that our private brand product offer value to our customer and typically provide with higher gross margin than comparable national brand product we sell the expansion of our private brand offering also subject to additional risk such potential product liability risk and mandatory or voluntary product recall our ability to successfully protect our proprietary right and successfully navigate and avoid claim related to the proprietary right of third party our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligation and regulatory requirement and other risk generally encountered by entity that source sell and market exclusive branded offering for retail an increase in sale of our private brand may also adversely affect sale of our vendor product which in turn could adversely affect our relationship with

investment in our information technology system and table of contentsinfrastructure some of which are significant upgrade involve replacing existing system with successor system making change to existing system or cost effectively acquiring new system with new functionality implementing new system carry significant potential risk including failure to operate designed potential loss or corruption of data or information cost overrun implementation delay disruption of operation and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirement while we are aware of inherent risk associated with replacing these system and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risk there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issue with our existing system prior to implementation that our technology initiative will be successfully deployed planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operation we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the system of third party we interact with including key payer and vendor if we or the business we interact with do not maintain the

reputation and expose to regulatory action and claim from customer financial institution payment card association and other person any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operation financial condition and result of operation because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may not immediately produce sign of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure in addition security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resource related to the security of information system and disrupt our business the regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirement across business we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulation in the united state and in other country in which we operate that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including the transfer of personal data between or among country some foreign data privacy regulation are more stringent than those in the united state and continue to change for example in may the general data protection regulation will supersede current european union data protection legislation impose more stringent european union data protection requirement and provide for greater penalty for noncompliance complying with these and other changing requirement could cause to incur substantial cost and require to change our business practice in certain jurisdiction any of which could materially adversely affect our business operation and operating result we may also face audit or investigation by one or more domestic or foreign government agency relating to our compliance with these regulation compliance with change in privacy and information security law and standard may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational process if we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these law and regulation or experience data security breach our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risk our security measure may be undermined due to the action of outside party employee error malfeasance or otherwise and result an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data system and misappropriate business and personal information any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure damage to our reputation and potentially have material adverse effect on our business operation financial condition and result of operation we are subject to payment related risk that could increase our operating cost expose to fraud or theft subject to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operation we accept payment using variety of method including cash check credit and debit card gift card and mobile payment technology such apple pay and we may offer new payment option over time acceptance of these payment option subject to rule regulation contractual obligation and compliance requirement including payment network rule and operating guideline data security standard and certification requirement and rule governing electronic fund transfer these requirement and related interpretation may change over time which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment method including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase over table of contentstime and raise our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and other form of electronic payment if these company become unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised it could disrupt our business the payment method that we offer also subject to potential fraud and theft by person who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness that may exist in the payment system if we fail to comply with applicable rule or requirement or if data is compromised due to breach or misuse of data relating to our payment system we may be liable for cost incurred by payment card issuing bank and other third party or subject to fine and higher transaction fee or our ability to accept or facilitate certain type of payment could be impaired in addition our reputation could suffer and our customer could lose confidence in certain payment type which could result in higher cost and or reduced sale and materially and adversely affect our result of operation change in healthcare regulatory environment may adversely affect our business political economic and regulatory influence are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant change that could adversely affect our result of operation in recent year the healthcare industry ha undergone significant change in an effort to reduce cost and government spending these change include an increased reliance on managed care cut in certain medicare and medicaid funding in the united state and the funding of governmental payer in foreign jurisdiction consolidation of competitor supplier and other market participant and the development of large sophisticated purchasing group we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential change such reduction in governmental

and include amount based on management prudent judgment and estimate actual result may differ from these estimate management belief that any reasonable deviation from those judgment and estimate would not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation to the extent that the estimate used differ from actual result however adjustment to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet account would be necessary these adjustment would be made in future period some of the more significant estimate include business combination goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment cost of sale and inventory equity method investment pension and postretirement benefit and income tax we use the following method to determine our estimate business combination we account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest be recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of asset and liability acquired requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset we generally use the income approach to determine fair value the income approach requires management to make significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption primarily include but are not limited to discount rate terminal growth rate royalty rate forecast of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditure the discount rate applied to the projection reflect the risk factor associated with those projection although we believe our estimate of fair value are reasonable actual financial result could differ from those estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate change in assumption concerning future financial result or other underlying assumption could have significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset acquired judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset useful life goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit we determine fair value for each reporting unit this determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approach the income approach requires management to estimate number of factor for each reporting unit including projected future operating result economic projection anticipated future cash flow and discount rate the market approach estimate fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within comparable industry grouping table of contentsthe determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires to make significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption primarily include but are not limited to the selection of appropriate peer group company control premium appropriate for acquisition in the industry in which we compete discount rate terminal growth rate forecast of revenue operating income depreciation amortization and capital expenditure although we believe our estimate of fair value are reasonable actual financial result could differ from those estimate due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimate change in assumption concerning future financial result or other underlying assumption could have significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both we also compared the sum of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the company fair value implied by the market value of the company equity and debt security this comparison indicated that in total our assumption and estimate were reasonable however future decline in the overall market value of the company equity security may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting unit ha declined below it carrying value our reporting unit fair value exceeded their carrying amount ranging from approximately to more than due to the negative impact of reduction in pharmacy funding in the united kingdom the fair value of our boot reporting unit within our retail pharmacy international division wa impacted and is in excess of it carrying value by approximately the goodwill of the boot reporting unit is not currently impaired and we will continue to monitor the industry trend and the impact it may have on the business see note goodwill and other intangible asset to the consolidated financial statement for additional information indefinite lived intangible asset are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written to it estimated fair value our indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach

by governmental authority arising in the normal course of the company business including the matter described below legal proceeding in general and security and class action litigation in particular

reserve and right to indemnification will have material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial position however substantial unanticipated verdict fine and ruling do sometimes occur result the company could from time to time incur judgment enter into settlement or revise it expectation regarding the outcome of certain matter and such development could have material adverse effect

for outstanding legal proceeding and reserve are established on case by case basis for those legal claim for which management concludes that it is probable that loss will be incurred and that the

any loss can be complex with respect to litigation and other legal proceeding where the company ha determined that loss is reasonably possible the company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainty regarding such litigation and legal proceeding the company assessment are based on estimate and assumption that have been deemed reasonable by management but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated event and circumstance may occur that might cause the company to change those estimate and assumption therefore it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingency could have material adverse effect on the company consolidated financial statement in future fiscal period management assessment of current litigation and other legal proceeding including the corresponding accrual could change because of the
