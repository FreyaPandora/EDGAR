website part item item risk factor our operation and financial result are subject to various risk and uncertainty including those described below that could adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and the trading price of our common stock we face intense competition across all market for our product and service which may lead to lower revenue or operating margin competition in the technology sector our competitor range in size from diversified global company with significant research and development resource to small specialized firm whose narrower product line may let them be more effective in deploying technical marketing and financial resource barrier to entry in many of our business are low and many of the area in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technology shifting user need and frequent introduction of new product and service our ability to remain competitive depends on our success in making innovative product device and service that appeal to business and consumer competition among platform based ecosystem an important element of our business model ha been to create platform based ecosystem on which many participant can build diverse solution well established ecosystem creates beneficial network effect among user application developer and the platform provider that can accelerate growth establishing significant scale in the marketplace is necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margin we face significant competition from firm that provide competing platform competing vertically integrated model in which single firm control the software and hardware element of product and related service ha succeeded with consumer product such personal computer tablet phone gaming console wearable and other endpoint device competitor pursuing this model also earn revenue from service integrated with the hardware and software platform including application and content sold through their integrated marketplace they may also be able to claim security and performance benefit from their vertically integrated offer we also offer some vertically integrated hardware and software product and service to the extent we shift portion of our business to vertically integrated model we increase our cost of revenue and reduce our operating margin we derive substantial revenue from license of window operating system on personal computer we face significant competition from competing platform developed for new device and form factor such smartphones and tablet computer these device compete on multiple base including price and the perceived utility of the device and it platform user are increasingly turning to these device to perform function that in the past were performed by personal computer even if many user view these device complementary to personal computer the prevalence of these device may make it more difficult to attract application developer to our pc operating system platform competing with operating system licensed at low or no cost may decrease our pc operating system margin popular product or service offered on competing platform could increase their competitive strength in addition some of our device compete with product made by our original equipment manufacturer oem partner which may affect their commitment to our platform competing platform have content and application marketplace with scale and significant installed base the variety and utility of content and application available on platform are important to device purchasing decision user may incur cost to move data and buy new content and application when switching platform to compete we must successfully enlist developer to write application for our platform and ensure that these application have high quality security customer appeal and value effort to compete with competitor content and application marketplace may increase our cost of revenue and lower our operating margin part item business model competition company compete with based on growing variety of business model even we transition more of our business to infrastructure platform and software service business model the license based proprietary software model generates substantial portion of our software revenue we bear the cost of converting original idea into software product through investment in research and development offsetting these cost with the revenue received from licensing our product many of our competitor also develop and sell software to business and consumer under this model other competitor develop and offer free application online service and content and make money by selling third party advertising advertising revenue fund development of product and service these competitor provide to user at no or little cost competing directly with our revenue generating product some company compete with by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end user and earning revenue on advertising or integrated product and service these firm not bear the full cost of research and development for the open source software some open source software mimic the feature and functionality of our product the competitive pressure described may cause decreased sale volume price reduction and or increased operating cost such for research and development marketing and sale incentive this may lead to lower revenue gross margin and operating income our increasing focus on cloud based service present execution and competitive risk growing part of our business involves cloud based service available across the spectrum of computing device our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building best in class platform and productivity service for an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence ai at the time our competitor are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based service for consumer and business customer pricing and delivery model are evolving device and form factor influence how user access service in the cloud and sometimes the user choice of which cloud based service to use we are devoting significant resource to develop and deploy our cloud based strategy the window ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment we are undertaking cultural and organizational change to drive accountability and eliminate obstacle to innovation our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the internet of thing iot our success in the iot will depend on the level of adoption of our offering such microsoft azure azure stack azure iot edge and azure sphere we may not establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to achieve our business objective besides software development cost we are incurring cost to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing service these cost will reduce the operating margin we have previously achieved whether we succeed in cloud based service depends on our execution in several area including continuing to bring to market compelling cloud based experience that generate increasing traffic and market share maintaining the utility compatibility and performance of our cloud based service on the growing array of computing device including pc smartphones tablet gaming console and other device well sensor and other endpoint continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platform to third party developer ensuring our cloud based service meet the reliability expectation of our customer and maintain the security of their data making our suite of cloud based service platform agnostic available on wide range of device and ecosystem including those of our competitor it is uncertain whether our strategy will attract the user or generate the revenue required to succeed if we are not effective in executing organizational and technical change to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new product and service we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investment described above this may negatively impact gross margin and operating income part item we make significant investment in product and service that may not achieve expected return we will continue to make significant investment in research development and marketing for existing product service and technology including the window operating system microsoft office bing microsoft sql server window server azure office xbox live mixer linkedin and other product and service we also invest in the development and acquisition of variety of hardware for productivity communication and entertainment including pc tablet gaming device and hololens investment in new technology are speculative commercial success depends on many factor including innovativeness developer support and effective distribution and marketing if customer do not perceive our latest offering providing significant new functionality or other value they may reduce their purchase of new software and hardware product or upgrade unfavorably affecting revenue we may not achieve significant revenue from new product service and distribution channel investment for several year if at all new product and service may not be profitable and even if they are profitable operating margin for some new product and business will not be high the margin we have experienced historically we may not get engagement in certain feature like microsoft edge and bing that drive post sale monetization opportunity our data handling practice across our product and service will continue to be under scrutiny and perception of mismanagement driven by regulatory activity or negative public reaction to our practice or product experience which could negatively impact product and feature adoption product design and product quality developing new technology is complex it can require long development and testing period significant delay in new release or significant problem in creating new product or service could adversely affect our revenue acquisition joint venture and strategic alliance may have an adverse effect on our business we expect to continue making acquisition and entering into joint venture and strategic alliance part of our long term business strategy in december we completed our acquisition of linkedin corporation linkedin for billion and in october we completed our acquisition of github inc for billion these acquisition and other transaction and arrangement involve significant challenge and risk including that they do not advance our business strategy that we get an unsatisfactory return on our investment that we have difficulty integrating and retaining new employee business system and technology or that they distract management from our other business if an arrangement fails to adequately anticipate changing circumstance and interest of party it may result in early termination or renegotiation of the arrangement the success of these transaction and arrangement will depend in part on our ability to leverage them to enhance our existing product and service or develop compelling new one it may take longer than expected to realize the full benefit from these transaction and arrangement such increased revenue or enhanced efficiency or the benefit may ultimately be smaller than we expected these event could adversely affect our consolidated financial statement if our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings we acquire other company and intangible asset and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisition which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangible we review our amortizable intangible asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable we test goodwill for impairment at least annually factor that may be change in circumstance indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable include decline in our stock price and market capitalization reduced future cash flow estimate and slower growth rate in industry segment in which we participate we have in the past recorded and may in the future be required to record significant charge on our consolidated financial statement during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible asset is determined negatively affecting our result of operation our acquisition of linkedin resulted in significant increase in our goodwill and intangible asset balance part item cyberattacks and security vulnerability could lead to reduced revenue increased cost liability claim or harm to our reputation or competitive position security of our information technology threat to it security can take variety of form individual and group of hacker and sophisticated organization including state sponsored organization or nation state continuously undertake attack that pose threat to our customer and our it these actor may use wide variety of method which may include developing and deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerability in hardware software or other infrastructure in order to attack our product and service or gain access to our network and datacenters using social engineering technique to induce our employee user partner or customer to disclose password or other sensitive information or take other action to gain access to our data or our user or customer data or acting in coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attack inadequate account security practice may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data for example system administrator may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate employee or third party may intentionally compromise our or our user security or system or reveal confidential information cyberthreats are constantly evolving increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them we may have no current capability to detect certain vulnerability which may allow them to persist in the environment over long period of time cyberthreats can have cascading impact that unfold with increasing speed across our internal network and system and those of our partner and customer breach of our facility network or data security could disrupt the security of our system and business application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and protect the privacy of their data result in product development delay compromise confidential or technical business information harming our reputation or competitive position result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or other asset require to allocate more resource to improved technology or otherwise adversely affect our business in addition our internal it environment continues to evolve often we are early adopter of new device and technology we embrace new way of sharing data and communicating internally and with partner and customer using method such social networking and other consumer oriented technology our business policy and internal security control may not keep pace with these change new threat emerge security of our product service device and customer data the security of our product and service is important in our customer decision to purchase or use our product or service security threat are significant challenge to company like whose business is providing technology product and service to others threat to our own it infrastructure can also affect our customer customer using our cloud based service rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other element provided by third party to ensure the reliability of our service and the protection of their data adversary tend to focus their effort on the most popular operating system program and service including many of and we expect that to continue adversary that acquire user account information at other company can use that information to compromise our user account account share the same attribute like password inadequate account security practice may also result in unauthorized access we are also increasingly incorporating open source software into our product there may be vulnerability in open source software that may make our product susceptible to cyberattacks to defend against security threat to our internal it system our cloud based service and our customer system we must continuously engineer more secure product and service enhance security and reliability feature improve the deployment of software update to address security vulnerability in our own product well those provided by others develop mitigation technology that help to secure customer from attack even when software update are not deployed maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity of our network product and service and provide security tool such firewall and anti virus software and information about the need to deploy security measure and the impact of part item the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin if we fail to do these thing well actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and service data corruption issue or reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customer to reduce or delay future purchase of product or subscription to service or to use competing product or service customer may also spend more on protecting their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of additional product or service customer may fail to update their system continue to run software or operating system we no longer support or may fail timely to install or enable security patch any of these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue actual or perceived vulnerability may lead to claim against our license agreement typically contain provision that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provision will withstand legal challenge at time to achieve commercial objective we may enter into agreement with larger liability exposure to customer illustrated by the spectre and meltdown threat our product operate in conjunction with and are dependent on product and component across broad ecosystem of third party if there is security vulnerability in one of these component and if there is security exploit targeting it we could face increased cost liability claim reduced revenue or harm to our reputation or competitive position disclosure and misuse of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud based offering we store and process increasingly large amount of personally identifiable information of our customer and user the continued occurrence of high profile data breach provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security despite our effort to improve the security control across our business group and geography it is possible our security control over personal data our training of employee and third party on data security and other practice we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure or misuse of customer or user data we or our vendor store and manage in addition third party who have limited access to our customer or user data may use this data in unauthorized way improper disclosure or misuse could harm our reputation lead to legal exposure to customer or user or subject to liability under law that protect personal data resulting in increased cost or loss of revenue our software product and service also enable our customer and user to store and process personal data on premise or increasingly in cloud based environment we host government authority can sometimes require to produce customer or user data in response to valid legal order in the and elsewhere we advocate for transparency concerning these request and appropriate limitation on government authority to compel disclosure despite our effort to protect customer and user data perception that the collection use and retention of personal information is not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sale of our product or service and could limit adoption of our cloud based solution by consumer business and government entity additional security measure we may take to address customer or user concern or constraint on our flexibility to determine where and how to operate datacenters in response to customer or user expectation or governmental rule or action may cause higher operating expense or hinder growth of our product and service we may not be able to protect information in our product and service from use by others linkedin and other microsoft product and service contain valuable information and content protected by contractual restriction or technical measure in certain case we have made commitment to our member and user to limit access to or use of this information change in the law or interpretation of the law may weaken our ability to prevent third party from scraping or gathering information or content through use of bot or other measure and using it for their own benefit thus diminishing the value of our product and service abuse of our platform may harm our reputation or user engagement advertising professional and social platform abuse for linkedin microsoft advertising msn xbox live and other product and service that provide content or host ad that come from or can be influenced by third party our reputation or user engagement may be negatively affected by activity that is hostile or inappropriate this activity may come from user impersonating other people or organization use of our product or service to spread terrorist or violent extremist content or to disseminate information that may be viewed misleading or intended to manipulate the opinion of our user or the use of our product or service that violates our term of service or otherwise for objectionable or illegal end preventing or responding to these action may require to make substantial investment in people and technology and these investment may not be successful adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statement part item harmful content online our hosted consumer service well our enterprise service may be used by third party to disseminate harmful or illegal content in violation of our term or applicable law we may not proactively discover such content due to scale and the limitation of existing technology and when discovered by user such content may negatively affect our reputation our brand and user engagement regulation and other initiative to make platform responsible for preventing or eliminating harmful content online are gaining momentum and we expect this to continue we may be subject to enhanced regulatory oversight substantial liability or reputational damage if we fail to comply with content moderation regulation adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statement the development of the iot present security privacy and execution risk to support the growth of the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge we are developing product service and technology to power the iot network of distributed and interconnected device employing sensor data and computing capability including ai the iot great potential also carry substantial risk iot product and service may contain defect in design manufacture or operation that make them insecure or ineffective for their intended purpose an iot solution ha multiple layer of hardware sensor processor software and firmware several of which we may not develop or control each layer including the weakest layer can impact the security of the whole system many iot device have limited interface and ability to be updated or patched iot solution may collect large amount of data and our handling of iot data may not satisfy customer or regulatory requirement iot scenario may increasingly affect personal health and safety if iot solution that include our technology do not work intended violate the law or harm individual or business we may be subject to legal claim or enforcement action these risk if realized may increase our cost damage our reputation or brand or negatively impact our revenue or margin issue in the use of ai in our offering may result in reputational harm or liability we are building ai into many of our offering and we expect this element of our business to grow we envision future in which ai operating in our device application and the cloud help our customer be more productive in their work and personal life with many disruptive innovation ai present risk and challenge that could affect it adoption and therefore our business ai algorithm may be flawed datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information inappropriate or controversial data practice by microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of ai solution these deficiency could undermine the decision prediction or analysis ai application produce subjecting to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm some ai scenario present ethical issue if we enable or offer ai solution that are controversial because of their impact on human right privacy employment or other social issue we may experience brand or reputational harm we may have excessive outage data loss and disruption of our online service if we fail to maintain an adequate operation infrastructure our increasing user traffic growth in service and the complexity of our product and service demand more computing power we spend substantial amount to build purchase or lease datacenters and equipment and to upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle more traffic on our website and in our datacenters these demand continue to increase we introduce new product and service and support the growth of existing service such bing azure microsoft account service office microsoft team dynamic onedrive sharepoint online skype xbox live and outlook com we are rapidly growing our business of providing platform and back end hosting for service provided by third party to their end user maintaining securing and expanding this infrastructure is expensive and complex it requires that we maintain an internet connectivity infrastructure that is robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraint that continue to evolve inefficiency or operational failure including temporary or permanent loss of customer data or insufficient internet connectivity could diminish the quality of our product service and user experience resulting in contractual liability claim by customer and other third party regulatory action damage to our reputation and loss of current and potential user subscriber and advertiser each of which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statement we may experience quality or supply problem our hardware product such xbox console surface device and other device we design manufacture and market are highly complex and can have defect in design manufacture or associated software we could incur significant expense lost revenue and reputational harm result of recall safety alert or product liability claim if we fail to prevent detect or address such issue through design testing or warranty repair part item our software product and service also may experience quality or reliability problem the highly sophisticated software we develop may contain bug and other defect that interfere with their intended operation our customer increasingly rely on for critical function potentially magnifying the impact of quality or reliability issue any defect we do not detect and fix in pre release testing could cause reduced sale and revenue damage to our reputation repair or remediation cost delay in the release of new product or version or legal liability although our license agreement typically contain provision that eliminate or limit our exposure to liability there is no assurance these provision will withstand legal challenge we acquire some device and datacenter component from sole supplier our competitor use some of the same supplier and their demand for hardware component can affect the capacity available to if component from sole source supplier is delayed or becomes unavailable whether because of supplier capacity constraint industry shortage legal or regulatory change or other reason we may not obtain timely replacement supply resulting in reduced sale or inadequate datacenter capacity component shortage excess or obsolete inventory or price reduction resulting in inventory adjustment may increase our cost of revenue xbox console surface device datacenter server and other hardware are assembled in asia and other geography that may be subject to disruption in the supply chain resulting in shortage that would affect our revenue and operating margin these same risk would apply to any other hardware and software product we may offer we may not be able to protect our source code from copying if there is an unauthorized disclosure source code the detailed program command for our operating system and other software program is critical to our business although we license portion of our application and operating system source code to several licensee we take significant measure to protect the secrecy of large portion of our source code if our source code leak we might lose future trade secret protection for that code it may then become easier for third party to compete with our product by copying functionality which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margin unauthorized disclosure of source code also could increase the security risk described in the next paragraph legal change our evolving business model piracy and other factor may decrease the value of our intellectual property protecting our intellectual property right and combating unlicensed copying and use of our software and other intellectual property on global basis is difficult while piracy adversely affect revenue the impact on revenue from outside the is more significant particularly country in which the legal system provides le protection for intellectual property right our revenue in these market may grow more slowly than the underlying device market similarly the absence of harmonized patent law make it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for patent right throughout the world we educate user about the benefit of licensing genuine product and obtaining indemnification benefit for intellectual property risk and we educate lawmaker about the advantage of business climate where intellectual property right are protected reduction in the legal protection for software intellectual property right could adversely affect revenue we expend significant resource to patent the intellectual property we create with the expectation that we will generate revenue by incorporating that intellectual property in our product or service or in some instance by licensing our patent to others in return for royalty change in the law may continue to weaken our ability to prevent the use of patented technology or collect revenue for licensing our patent these include legislative change and regulatory action that make it more difficult to obtain injunction and the increasing use of legal process to challenge issued patent similarly licensee of our patent may fail to satisfy their obligation to pay royalty or may contest the scope and extent of their obligation the royalty we can obtain to monetize our intellectual property may decline because of the evolution of technology selling price change in product using licensed patent or the difficulty of discovering infringement finally our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause to license our intellectual property right broadly in certain situation and may negatively impact revenue part item third party may claim we infringe their intellectual property right from time to time others claim we infringe their intellectual property right the number of these claim may grow because of constant technological change in the market in which we compete the extensive patent coverage of existing technology the rapid rate of issuance of new patent and our offering of first party device such microsoft surface to resolve these claim we may enter into royalty and licensing agreement on term that are le favorable than currently available stop selling or redesign affected product or service or pay damage to satisfy indemnification commitment with our customer these outcome may cause operating margin to decline besides money damage in some jurisdiction plaintiff can seek injunctive relief that may limit or prevent importing marketing and selling our product or service that have infringing technology in some country such germany an injunction can be issued before the party have fully litigated the validity of the underlying patent we have paid significant amount to settle claim related to the use of technology and intellectual property right and to procure intellectual property right part of our strategy to manage this risk and may continue to do so we have claim and lawsuit against that may result in adverse outcome we are subject to variety of claim and lawsuit these claim may arise from wide variety of business practice and initiative including major new product release such window significant business transaction warranty or product claim and employment practice adverse outcome in some or all of these claim may result in significant monetary damage or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business the litigation and other claim are subject to inherent uncertainty and management view of these matter may change in the future material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable government litigation and regulatory activity relating to competition rule may limit how we design and market our product leading global software and device maker government agency closely scrutinize under and foreign competition law government are actively enforcing competition law and regulation and this includes scrutiny in potentially large market such the european union eu the and china some jurisdiction also allow competitor or consumer to assert claim of anti competitive conduct federal and state antitrust authority have previously brought enforcement action and continue to scrutinize our business the european commission the commission closely scrutinizes the design of high volume microsoft product and the term on which we make certain technology used in these product such file format programming interface and protocol available to other company flagship product release such window can receive significant scrutiny under competition law for example in the commission ordered to create new version of our window operating system that do not include certain multimedia technology and to provide our competitor with specification for how to implement certain proprietary window communication protocol in their own product in the commission accepted set of commitment we offered to address the commission concern relating to competition in web browsing software including an undertaking to address commission concern relating to interoperability the web browsing commitment expired in the remaining obligation may limit our ability to innovate in window or other product in the future diminish the developer appeal of the window platform and increase our product development cost the availability of license related to protocol and file format may enable competitor to develop software product that better mimic the functionality of our product which could hamper sale of our product our portfolio of first party device continues to grow at the same time our oem partner offer large variety of device for our platform result increasingly we both cooperate and compete with our oem partner creating risk that we fail to do so in compliance with competition rule regulatory scrutiny in this area may increase certain foreign government particularly in china and other country in asia have advanced argument under their competition law that exert downward pressure on royalty for our intellectual property government regulatory action and court decision such these may result in fine or hinder our ability to provide the benefit of our software to consumer and business reducing the attractiveness of our product and the revenue that come from them new competition law action could be initiated potentially using previous action precedent the outcome of such action or step taken to avoid them could adversely affect in variety of way including we may have to choose between withdrawing product from certain geography to avoid fine or designing and developing alternative version of those product to comply with government ruling which may entail delay in product release and removing functionality that customer want or on which developer rely part item we may be required to make available license to our proprietary technology on term that do not reflect their fair market value or do not protect our associated intellectual property we are subject to variety of ongoing commitment because of court or administrative order consent decree or other voluntary action we have taken if we fail to comply with these commitment we may incur litigation cost and be subject to substantial fine or other remedial action our ability to realize anticipated window post sale monetization opportunity may be limited our global operation subject to potential liability under anti corruption trade protection and other law and regulation the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and other anti corruption law and regulation anti corruption law prohibit corrupt payment by our employee vendor or agent and the accounting provision of the fcpa require to maintain accurate book and record and adequate internal control from time to time we receive inquiry from authority in the and elsewhere which may be based on report from employee and others about our business activity outside the and our compliance with anti corruption law periodically we receive such report directly and investigate them on july our hungarian subsidiary entered into non prosecution agreement npa with the department of justice doj and we agreed to the term of cease and desist order with the security and exchange commission these agreement required to pay million in monetary penalty disgorgement and interest pertaining to activity at microsoft subsidiary in hungary the npa which ha three year term also contains certain ongoing compliance requirement including the obligation to disclose to the doj issue that may implicate the fcpa and to cooperate in any inquiry most country in which we operate also have competition law that prohibit competitor from colluding or otherwise attempting to reduce competition between themselves while we devote substantial resource to our and international compliance program and have implemented policy training and internal control designed to reduce the risk of corrupt payment and collusive activity our employee vendor or agent may violate our policy our failure to comply with anti corruption law or competition law could result in significant fine and penalty criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation operation outside the may be affected by change in trade protection law policy sanction and other regulatory requirement affecting trade and investment we may be subject to legal liability and reputational damage if we sell good or service in violation of trade sanction on restricted entity or country such iran north korea cuba sudan and syria other regulatory area that may apply to our product and online service offering include user privacy telecommunication data storage and protection and online content for example some regulator are taking the position that our offering such skype are covered by existing law regulating telecommunication service and some new law are defining more of our service regulated telecommunication service this trend may continue and will result in these offering being subjected to additional data protection security and law enforcement surveillance obligation data protection authority may assert that our collection use and management of customer data is inconsistent with their law and regulation legislative or regulatory action relating to cybersecurity requirement may increase the cost to develop implement or secure our product and service legislative or regulatory action could also emerge in the area of ai and content moderation increasing cost or restricting opportunity applying these law and regulation to our business is often unclear subject to change over time and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction to jurisdiction additionally these law and government approach to their enforcement and our product and service are continuing to evolve compliance with these type of regulation may involve significant cost or require change in product or business practice that result in reduced revenue noncompliance could result in the imposition of penalty or order we stop the alleged noncompliant activity we strive to empower all people and organization to achieve more and accessibility of our product is an important aspect of this goal there is increasing pressure from advocacy group regulator competitor customer and other stakeholder to make technology more accessible if our product do not meet customer expectation or emerging global accessibility requirement we could lose sale opportunity or face regulatory action part item law and regulation relating to the handling of personal data may impede the adoption of our service or result in increased cost legal claim fine against or reputational damage the growth of our internet and cloud based service internationally relies increasingly on the movement of data across national boundary legal requirement relating to the collection storage handling and transfer of personal data continue to evolve for example the eu and the formally entered into new framework in july that provides mechanism for company to transfer data from eu member state to the this framework called the privacy shield is intended to address shortcoming identified by the european court of justice in predecessor mechanism the privacy shield and other mechanism are currently subject to challenge in european court which may lead to uncertainty about the legal basis for data transfer across the

distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time certain cloud service primarily office depend on significant level of integration interdependency and interrelation between the desktop application and cloud service and are accounted for together one performance obligation revenue from office is recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud service are provided judgment is required to determine the stand alone selling price ssp for each distinct performance obligation we use single amount to estimate ssp for item that are not sold separately including on premise license sold with sa or software update provided at no additional charge we use range of amount to estimate ssp when we sell each of the product and service separately and need to determine whether there is discount to be allocated based on the relative ssp of the various product and service in instance where ssp is not directly observable such when we do not sell the product or service separately we determine the ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we typically have more than one ssp for individual product and service due to

of debt instrument issuer and the duration and extent to which the fair value is le than cost we also evaluate whether we have plan to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery in addition we consider specific adverse condition related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance change in technology and operational and financing cash flow factor decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established if market industry and or investee condition deteriorate we may incur future impairment equity investment without readily determinable fair value are written to fair value if qualitative assessment indicates that the investment is impaired and the fair value of the investment is le than carrying value we perform qualitative assessment on quarterly basis we are required to estimate the fair value of the investment to determine the amount of the impairment loss once an investment is determined to be impaired an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination we evaluate our reporting unit on an annual basis and if necessary reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value these event or circumstance could include significant change in the business climate legal factor operating performance indicator competition or sale or disposition of significant portion of reporting unit application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment including the identification of reporting unit assignment of asset and liability to reporting unit assignment of goodwill to reporting unit and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of discounted cash flow methodology this analysis requires significant judgment including estimation of future cash flow which is dependent on internal forecast estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business estimation of the useful life over which cash flow will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital the estimate used to calculate the fair value of reporting unit change from year to year based on operating result market condition and other factor change in these estimate and assumption could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit

excluding other than temporary impairment are recorded in oci debt investment are impaired when decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary fair value is calculated based on publicly available market information or other estimate determined by management we employ systematic methodology on quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investment if the cost of an investment exceeds it fair value we evaluate among other factor general market condition credit quality of debt instrument issuer and the duration and extent to which the fair value is le than cost we also evaluate whether we have plan to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery in addition we consider specific adverse condition related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee including industry and sector performance change in technology and operational and financing cash flow factor once decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary an impairment charge is recorded in other income expense net and new cost basis in the investment is established equity investment with readily determinable fair value are measured at fair value equity investment without readily determinable fair value are measured using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustment for observable change in price or impairment referred to the measurement alternative we perform qualitative assessment on quarterly basis and recognize an impairment if there are sufficient indicator that the fair value of the investment is le than carrying value change in value are recorded in other income expense net we lend certain fixed income and equity security to increase investment return these transaction are accounted for secured borrowing and the loaned security continue to be carried investment on our consolidated balance sheet cash and or security interest are received collateral for the loaned security with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower cash received is recorded an asset with corresponding liability derivative derivative instrument are recognized either asset or liability and measured at fair value the accounting for change in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge gain and loss are recognized in other income expense net with offsetting gain and loss on the hedged item for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge the effective portion of the gain and loss are initially reported component of oci and subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in revenue gain and loss on derivative representing either hedge component excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in other income expense net for derivative instrument that are not designated hedge gain and loss from change in fair value are primarily recognized in other income expense net fair value measurement we account for certain asset and liability at fair value the hierarchy below list three level of fair value based on the extent to which input used in measuring fair value are observable in the market we categorize each of our fair value measurement in one of these three level based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety these level are level input are based upon unadjusted quoted price for identical instrument in active market our level investment include government security common and preferred stock and mutual fund our level derivative asset and liability include those actively traded on exchange part ii item level input are based upon quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model based valuation technique the black scholes model for which all significant input are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability where applicable these model project future cash flow and discount the future amount to present value using market based observable input including interest rate curve credit spread foreign exchange rate and forward and spot price for currency our level investment include commercial paper certificate of deposit agency security foreign government bond mortgage and asset backed security corporate note and bond and municipal security our level derivative asset and liability primarily include certain over the counter option and swap contract level input are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimate of assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability the fair value are therefore determined using model based technique including option pricing model and discounted cash flow model our level asset and liability include investment in corporate note and bond and goodwill and intangible asset when they are recorded at fair value due to an impairment charge unobservable input used in the model are significant to the fair value of the asset and liability we measure equity investment without readily determinable fair value on nonrecurring basis the fair value of these investment are determined based on valuation technique using the best information available and may include quoted market price market comparables and discounted cash flow projection our other current financial asset and current financial liability have fair value that approximate their carrying value inventory inventory are stated at average cost subject to the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes material labor and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventory net realizable value is the estimated selling price le estimated cost of completion disposal and transportation we regularly review inventory quantity on hand future purchase commitment with our supplier and the estimated utility of our inventory if our review indicates reduction in utility below carrying value we reduce our inventory to new cost basis through charge to cost of revenue property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost le accumulated depreciation and depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term the estimated useful life of our property and equipment are generally follows computer software developed or acquired for internal use three to seven year computer equipment two to three year building and improvement five to year leasehold improvement three to year and furniture and equipment one to year land is not depreciated lease we determine if an arrangement is lease at inception operating lease are included in operating lease right of use rou asset other current liability and operating lease liability in our consolidated balance sheet finance lease are included in property and equipment other current liability and other long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet rou asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease operating lease rou asset and liability are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate we generally use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over similar term of the lease payment at commencement date the operating lease rou asset also includes any lease payment made and excludes lease incentive our lease term may include option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense for lease payment is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term part ii item we have lease agreement with lease and non lease component which are generally accounted for separately for certain equipment lease such vehicle we account for the lease and non lease component single lease component additionally for certain equipment lease we apply portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease rou asset and liability goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value intangible asset our intangible asset are subject to amortization and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated period of benefit ranging from one to year we evaluate the recoverability of intangible asset periodically by taking into account event or circumstance that may warrant revised estimate of useful life or that indicate the asset may be impaired recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting guidance income tax intra entity asset transfer in october the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequence of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs rather than when the asset ha been sold to an outside party we adopted the guidance effective july adoption of the guidance wa applied using

and disclosure of financial instrument most prominent among the change in the standard is the requirement for change in the fair value of our equity investment with certain exception to be recognized through net income rather than oci we adopted the standard effective july adoption of the standard wa applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income aoci to retained earnings of the effective date and we elected to measure equity investment without readily determinable fair value at cost with adjustment for observable change in price or impairment the cumulative effect adjustment included any previously held unrealized gain and loss held in aoci related to our equity investment carried at fair value well

retained earnings of the effective date we evaluated the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statement including accounting policy process and system and do not expect the impact to be material upon adoption financial instrument credit loss in june the fasb issued new standard to replace the incurred loss impairment methodology under current gaap with methodology that reflects expected credit loss and requires consideration of broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimate we will be required to use forward looking expected credit loss model for account receivables loan and other financial instrument credit loss relating to available for sale debt security will also be recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security the standard will be adopted upon the effective date for beginning july adoption of the standard will be applied using modified retrospective approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology with the new standard we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statement including accounting policy process and system note earnings per share basic earnings per share eps is computed based on the weighted average number of
