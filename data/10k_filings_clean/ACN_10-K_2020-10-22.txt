ha resulted in authority around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measure such travel restriction quarantine shelter in place order social distancing measure and temporary business closure the pandemic and the action taken by government business and individual in response to the pandemic have resulted in and are expected to continue to result in substantial curtailment of business activity weakened economic condition significant economic uncertainty and volatility the pandemic is significantly adversely impacting and could in the future materially adversely impact our business operation and financial result the extent to which the coronavirus pandemic will continue to impact our business operation and financial result will depend on numerous evolving factor that are difficult to accurately predict including the duration and scope of the pandemic and the continuation of additional outbreak how quickly and to what extent normal economic and social activity can resume the timing of the development and distribution of an effective vaccine or treatment for covid government business and individual action in response to the pandemic the prolonged effect on our client and client demand for our service and solution the degree to which client demand normalizes in remote work environment the reprioritization delay or termination of existing client engagement the ability of our client to pay for our service and solution the closure of our and our client office and restriction inhibiting our people ability to access those office have disrupted and will continue to disrupt our ability to sell and provide our service and have resulted in and may continue to result in loss of revenue in response to governmental directive and recommended safety measure we have enabled most of our employee to work remotely government ease their restriction our employee will likely increase their social interaction including in certain circumstance in our and our client office which could increase the risk of infection and could result in increased illness among our employee and associated risk including business interruption any of these event could cause contribute to or magnify the other risk and uncertainty enumerated below and could materially adversely affect our business financial condition result of operation and or stock price our result of

business activity global macroeconomic and geopolitical condition affect our client business and the market they serve economic and political condition have become increasingly volatile negative and uncertain due to the coronavirus pandemic among other reason and have undermined business confidence in our significant market and other market which are increasingly interdependent caused our client to reduce or defer their spending on new initiative and technology and resulted in client reducing delaying or eliminating spending under existing contract with which ha and may continue to negatively affect our business growth in the market we serve could be at slow rate or could stagnate or contract in each case for an extended period of time because we operate globally and have significant business in many market an economic slowdown in any of those market could adversely affect our result of operation ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand pattern affect our business in number of other way including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plan particularly in consulting economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take some time for the effect and change in demand pattern resulting from these and other factor to manifest table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor in our business and result of operation changing demand pattern from economic and political volatility and uncertainty including result of the covid pandemic change in global trade policy increasing geopolitical tension and trend such populism and economic nationalism election in our major market and their impact on our client and the industry we serve could continue to have significant negative impact on our result of operation our business depends on generating and maintaining ongoing profitable client demand for our service and solution including through the adaptation and expansion of our service and solution in response to ongoing change in technology and offering and significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our result of operation our revenue and profitability depend on the demand for our service and solution with favorable margin which could be negatively affected by numerous factor many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product described volatile negative or uncertain global economic and political condition and lower growth or contraction in the market we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our service and solution our success depends in part on our ability to continue to develop and implement service and solution that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing change in technology and offering to serve the evolving need of our client example of area of significant change include digital cloud and security related offering which are continually evolving well development in area such artificial intelligence augmented reality automation blockchain internet of thing quantum and edge computing and service solution technological development may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our client and in the case of service solution could affect the nature of how we generate revenue some of these technological development have reduced and replaced some of our historical service and solution and may continue to do in the future this ha caused and may in the future cause client to delay spending under existing contract and engagement and to delay entering into new contract while they evaluate new technology such technological development and spending delay can negatively impact our result of operation if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial model that reflect the value of these technological development or if the pace and level of spending on new technology are not sufficient to make any shortfall development in the industry we serve which may be rapid also could shift demand to new service and solution if result of new technology or change in the industry we serve our client demand new service and solution we may be le competitive in these new area or need to make significant investment to meet that demand our growth strategy focus on responding to these type of development by driving innovation that will enable to expand our business into new growth area if we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry development or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale or if we do not make the right strategic investment to respond to these development and successfully drive innovation our service and solution our result of operation and our ability to develop and maintain competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected we operate in rapidly evolving environment in which there currently are and we expect will continue to be new technology entrant new service or technology offered by competitor or new entrant may make our offering le differentiated or le competitive when compared to other alternative which may adversely affect our result of operation in addition company in the industry we serve sometimes seek to achieve economy of scale and other synergy by combining with or acquiring other company if one of our current client merges or consolidates with company that relies on another provider for the service and solution we offer we may lose work from that client or lose the opportunity to gain additional work if we are not successful in generating new opportunity from the merger or consolidation in particular geographic market service or industry group small number of client have contributed or may in the future contribute significant portion of the revenue of such geographic market service or industry group and any decision by such client to delay reduce or eliminate spending on our service and solution could have disproportionate impact on the result of operation in the relevant geographic market service or industry group many of our consulting contract are le than month in duration and these contract typically permit client to terminate the agreement with little day notice longer term larger and more complex contract such the majority of our outsourcing contract generally require longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our cost or make up for anticipated ongoing revenue and profit lost upon termination of the contract many of our contract allow client to terminate delay reduce or eliminate spending on the service and solution we provide additionally client could choose not to retain for additional stage of project try to renegotiate the term of it contract or cancel or delay additional planned work when contract are terminated or not renewed we lose the anticipated revenue and it may take significant time to replace the level of revenue lost consequently our result of operation in subsequent period could be materially lower than expected the specific business or financial condition of client change in management and change in client strategy are also all factor that can result in termination cancellation or delay table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor we are unable to keep our supply of skill and resource in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professional with strong leadership skill our business the utilization rate of our professional and our result of operation may be materially adversely affected our success is dependent in large part on our ability to keep our supply of market leading skill and capability in balance with client demand around the world and our ability to attract and retain personnel with the knowledge and skill to lead our business globally we must hire or reskill retain and motivate appropriate number of talented people with diverse skill in order to serve client across the globe respond quickly to rapid and ongoing change in technology industry and the macroeconomic environment and continuously innovate to grow our business for example if we are unable to hire or retrain our employee to keep pace with the rapid and continuous change in technology and the industry we serve we may not be able to innovate and deliver new service and solution to fulfill client demand there is intense competition for scarce talent with market leading skill and capability in new technology and our competitor have directly targeted our employee with these highly sought after skill and will likely continue to do so result we may be unable to cost effectively hire and retain employee with these market leading skill which may cause to incur increased cost or be unable to fulfill client demand for our service and solution we are particularly dependent on retaining member of accenture leadership with critical capability if we are unable to do so our ability to innovate generate new business opportunity and effectively lead large and complex transformation and client relationship could be jeopardized we depend on identifying developing and retaining top talent to innovate and lead our business this includes developing talent and leadership capability in emerging market where the depth of skilled employee may be limited and competition for these resource is intense our ability to expand in our key market depends in large part on our ability to attract develop retain and integrate both leader for the local business and people with critical capability similarly our profitability depends on our ability to effectively source and staff people with the right mix of skill and experience to perform service for our client including our ability to transition employee to new assignment on timely basis if we are unable to effectively deploy our employee globally and remotely on timely basis to fulfill the need of our client our profitability could suffer for example we have experienced reduced demand for strategy and consulting service during the covid pandemic and have staffed employee from these practice on project where we are experiencing strong client demand if we are unable to retain our top talent with these skill we may experience difficulty staffing these engagement when demand for these service rebound if our utilization rate is low our profitability and the engagement of our employee could suffer if the utilization rate of our professional is too high it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition the quality of the work performed well our ability to staff project the cost associated with recruiting and training employee are significant an important element of our global business model is the deployment of our employee around the world which allows to move talent needed therefore if we are not able to deploy the talent we need because of covid travel restriction or increased regulation of immigration or work visa including limitation placed on the number of visa granted limitation on the type of work performed or location in which the work can be performed and new or higher minimum salary requirement it could be more difficult to staff our employee on client engagement and could increase our cost our equity based incentive compensation plan are designed to reward high performing individual for their contribution and provide incentive for them to remain with if the anticipated value of such incentive doe not materialize because of volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price or if our total compensation package is not viewed competitive our ability to attract and retain the personnel we need could be adversely affected in addition if we do not obtain the shareholder approval needed to continue granting equity award under our share plan in the amount we believe are necessary our ability to attract and retain personnel could be negatively affected there is risk that at certain point in time we may have more personnel than we need in certain skill set or geography or at compensation level that are not aligned with skill set in these situation we have engaged and may in the future engage in action to rebalance our resource including reducing the rate of new hire and increasing involuntary termination mean to keep our supply of skill and resource in balance with client demand in fiscal we accelerated our usual level of performance related involuntary termination that would have otherwise occurred throughout fiscal at certain time and in certain geographical region we will find it difficult to hire and retain sufficient number of employee with the skill or background to meet current and or future demand in these case we might need to redeploy existing personnel or increase our reliance on subcontractor to fill certain labor need and if not done effectively our profitability could be negatively impacted additionally if demand for our service and solution were to escalate at high rate we may need to adjust our compensation practice which could put upward pressure on our cost and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased cost if we are not successful in these initiative our result of operation could be adversely affected table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor could face legal reputational and financial risk if we fail to protect client and or accenture data from security incident or cyberattacks we are dependent on information technology network and system to securely process transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our location around the world and with our people client alliance partner and vendor the breadth and complexity of this infrastructure continues to grow including result of the increasing reliance on and use of mobile technology social medium and

they offer including to company that are our client some competitor are more established in certain market and that may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these market more challenging additionally competitor may also offer more aggressive contractual term which may affect our ability to win work our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the market we currently serve if we are unable to compete successfully we could lose market share and client to competitor which could materially adversely affect our result of operation in addition we may face greater competition due to consolidation of company in the technology sector through strategic merger acquisition or teaming arrangement consolidation activity may result in new

technology company described above including many of our alliance partner are increasingly able to offer service related to their software platform cloud migration and other solution or are developing software platform cloud migration and other solution that require integration service to lesser extent these more integrated service and solution may represent more attractive alternative to client than some of our service and solution which may materially adversely affect our competitive position and our result of operation our profitability could materially suffer if we are unable to obtain favorable pricing for our service and solution if we are unable to remain competitive if our cost management strategy are unsuccessful or if we experience delivery inefficiency or fail to satisfy certain agreed upon target or specific service level our profitability is highly dependent on variety of factor and could be materially impacted by any of the following our result of operation could materially suffer if we are not able to obtain sufficient pricing to meet our profitability expectation if we are not able to obtain favorable pricing for our service and solution our revenue and profitability could materially suffer the rate we are able to charge for our service and solution are affected by number of factor including general economic and political condition our client desire to reduce their cost the competitive environment in our industry our ability to accurately estimate our service delivery cost upon which our pricing is sometimes determined includes our ability to estimate the impact of inflation and foreign exchange on our service delivery cost over long term contract and the procurement practice of client and their use of third party advisor our profitability could suffer if we are not able to remain competitive the competitive environment in our industry affect our ability to secure new contract at our target economics in number of way any of which could have material negative impact on our result of operation the le we are able to differentiate our service and solution and or clearly convey the value of our service and solution the more risk we have in winning new work in sufficient volume and at our target pricing and overall economics in addition the introduction of new service or product by competitor could reduce our ability to obtain favorable pricing and impact our overall economics for the service or solution we offer competitor may be willing at time to price contract lower than in an effort to enter the market or increase market share our profitability could suffer if our cost management strategy are unsuccessful and we may not be able to improve our profitability our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our cost including taking action to reduce certain cost our cost management strategy include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our service and solution and the workforce needed to deliver them if we are not effective in managing our operating cost in response to change in demand or pricing or if we are unable to cost effectively hire and retain personnel with the knowledge and skill necessary to deliver our service and solution particularly in area of new technology and offering and in the right geographic location we may incur increased cost which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rate of growth and our desired level of

business goal attained and adherence to schedule these goal can be complex and may depend on our client actual level of business activity or may be based on assumption that are later determined not to

our client to meet their commitment or for any other reason our contract could yield lower profit margin than planned or be unprofitable in particular large and complex arrangement often require that we utilize subcontractor or that our service and solution incorporate or coordinate with the software system or infrastructure requirement of other vendor and service provider including company with which we have alliance our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractor vendor and service provider to deliver their product and service in timely manner and in accordance with the

client system based on our service or solution could also subject to claim for significant damage that could materially adversely affect our result of operation we may enter into agreement with non standard term because we perceive an important economic opportunity or because our personnel not adequately follow our contracting guideline in addition the contracting practice of competitor along with the demand of increasingly sophisticated client may cause contract term and condition that are unfavorable to to become new standard in the industry we may commit to providing service or solution that we are unable to deliver or whose delivery may reduce our profitability or cause financial loss if we can not or do not meet our contractual obligation and if our potential liability is not adequately limited through the term of our agreement liability limitation are not enforced or third party alleges fraud or other wrongdoing to prevent from relying upon those contractual protection we might face significant legal liability and litigation expense and our result of operation could be materially adversely affected moreover we expand our service and solution into new area we may be exposed to additional and evolving risk specific to these new area in addition we engage in platform trust and safety service on behalf of client including content moderation which could have negative impact on our employee due to the nature of the material they review we have been subject to medium coverage regarding our provision of these service well litigation related to the provision of these service which may result in adverse judgment or settlement while we maintain insurance for certain potential liability such insurance doe not cover all type and amount of potential liability and is subject to various exclusion well cap on amount recoverable even if we believe claim is covered by insurance insurer may dispute our entitlement to recovery for variety of potential reason which may affect the timing and if they prevail the amount of our recovery our work with government client expose to additional risk inherent in the government contracting environment our client include national provincial state and local governmental entity our government work carry various risk inherent in the government contracting process these risk include but are not limited to the following government entity particularly in the united state often reserve the right to audit our contract cost and conduct inquiry and investigation of our business practice and compliance with government contract requirement government agency including the defense contract audit agency routinely audit our contract cost including allocated indirect cost for compliance with the cost accounting standard and the federal acquisition regulation these agency also conduct review and investigation and make inquiry regarding our accounting information technology and other system in connection with our performance and business practice with respect to our government contract negative finding from existing and future audit investigation or inquiry or failure to comply with applicable it security requirement could affect our future sale and profitability by preventing by operation of law or in practice from receiving new government contract for some period of time in addition if the government concludes that certain cost are not reimbursable have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimate of our work then we will not be allowed to bill for such cost may have to refund money that ha already been paid to or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rate for our work negative finding from existing and future audit of our business system including our accounting system may result in the government preventing from billing at least temporarily percentage of our cost result of prior negative finding in connection with audit investigation and inquiry we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequence described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequence which could materially adversely affect our future result of operation if government client discovers improper or illegal activity in the course of audit or investigation we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalty including those under the civil false claim act and administrative sanction which may include termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or debarment from doing business with other agency of that government the inherent limitation of internal control may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activity government

involving fraud table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor of interest bribery or improper gratuity violation of the civil false claim act or receipt of significant overpayment from the government failure to make required disclosure could be basis for suspension and or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the federal level reported matter also could lead to audit or investigation and other civil criminal or administrative sanction government contract are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risk compared to contract with commercial client for example government contract and the proceeding surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity negative publicity including an allegation of improper or illegal activity regardless of it accuracy may adversely affect our reputation term and condition of government contract also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate for example these contract often contain high or unlimited liability for breach and feature le favorable payment term and sometimes require to take on liability for the performance of third party government entity typically fund project through appropriated monies while these project are often planned and executed multi year project government entity usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these project for lack of approved funding and or at their convenience change in government or political development including budget deficit shortfall or uncertainty government spending reduction or other debt constraint could result in our project being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether which also could limit our recovery of incurred cost reimbursable expense and profit on work completed prior to the termination furthermore if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination cost we may not be able to fully recover our investment political and economic factor such pending election the outcome of recent election change in leadership among key executive or legislative decision maker revision to governmental tax or other policy and reduced tax revenue can affect the number and term of new government contract signed or the speed at which new contract are signed decrease future level of spending and authorization for program that we bid shift spending priority to program in area for which we do not provide service and or lead to change in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rule or law is assessed our ability to work for the government is impacted by the fact that we are an irish company we elected to enter into proxy agreement with the department of defense that enhances the ability of our federal government contracting subsidiary to perform certain work for the government the proxy agreement regulates the management and operation of and limit the control we can exercise over this subsidiary in addition legislative and executive proposal remain under consideration or could be proposed in the future which if enacted could place additional limitation on or even prohibit our eligibility to be awarded state or federal government contract in the united state or could include requirement that would otherwise affect our result of operation various federal and state legislative proposal have been introduced and or enacted in recent year that deny government contract to certain company that reincorporate or have reincorporated outside the united state while accenture wa not company that reincorporated outside the united state it is possible that these contract ban and other legislative proposal could be applied in way that negatively affect accenture the occurrence or condition described above could affect not only our business with the particular government entity involved but also our business with other entity of the or other governmental body or with certain commercial client and could have material adverse effect on our business or our result of operation our result of operation could be materially adversely affected by fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate although we report our result of operation in dollar majority of our revenue is denominated in currency other than the dollar unfavorable fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate have had an adverse effect and could in the future have material adverse effect on our result of operation because our consolidated financial statement are presented in dollar we must translate revenue expense and income well asset and liability into dollar at exchange rate in effect during or at the end of each reporting period therefore change in the value of the dollar against other currency will affect our revenue operating income and the value of balance sheet item including intercompany payable and receivables originally denominated in other currency these change cause our growth stated in dollar to be higher or lower than our growth in local currency when compared against other period our currency hedging program which are designed to partially offset the impact on consolidated earnings related to the change in value of certain balance sheet item might not be successful additionally some transaction and balance may be denominated in currency for which there is no available market to hedge we continue to leverage our global delivery model more of our expense are incurred in currency other than those in which we bill for the related service an increase in the value of certain currency such the indian rupee or philippine peso against the currency in which our revenue is recorded could increase cost for delivery of service at off shore site table of contentsaccenture form kitem risk factor increasing labor and other cost that are denominated in local currency our contractual provision or cost management effort might not be able to offset their impact and our currency hedging activity which are designed to partially offset this impact might not be successful this could result in decrease in the profitability of our contract that are utilizing delivery center resource in addition our currency hedging activity are themselves subject to risk these include risk related to counterparty performance under hedging contract risk related to ineffective hedge and risk related to currency fluctuation we also face risk that extreme economic condition political instability or hostility or disaster of the type described below could impact or perhaps eliminate the underlying exposure that we are hedging such an event could lead to loss being recognized on the currency hedge then in place that are not offset by anticipated change in the underlying hedge exposure if we are unable to manage the organizational challenge associated with our size we might be unable to achieve our business objective of august

large enterprise and effectively institutionalize our knowledge it might also become more difficult to maintain our culture effectively manage and monitor our personnel and operation and effectively communicate our core value policy and procedure strategy and goal particularly given our world wide operation the size and scope of our operation increase the possibility that we will have employee who engage in unlawful or fraudulent activity or otherwise expose to unacceptable business risk despite our effort to train them and maintain internal control to prevent such instance for example employee misconduct could involve the improper use of sensitive or confidential information entrusted to or obtained inappropriately or the failure to comply with legislation or regulation regarding

addition some of our alliance partner are also large client or supplier of technology to the decision we make vi vi an alliance partner may impact our ongoing alliance relationship in addition our alliance partner could experience reduced demand for their technology or software including for example in response to change in technology which could lessen related demand for our service and solution we must anticipate and respond to continuous change in technology and develop alliance relationship with new provider of relevant technology we must secure meaningful alliance with these provider early in their life cycle so that we can develop the right number of certified people with skill in new technology if we are unable to maintain our relationship with current partner and

unexpected increase in tax or other adverse effect on our relationship with client and our business in addition we have lesser degree of control over the business operation of the joint venture and business in which we have made minority investment or in which we have acquired le than of the equity this lesser degree of control may expose to additional reputational financial legal compliance or operational risk litigation indemnification claim and other unforeseen claim and liability may arise from the acquisition or operation of acquired business for example we may face litigation or other claim result of certain term and condition of the acquisition agreement such earnout payment or closing net asset adjustment alternatively shareholder litigation may arise result of proposed

any divestiture we undertake could adversely affect our result of operation if we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property right or if our service or solution infringe upon the intellectual property right of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others our business could be adversely affected our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platform methodology process software and other solution existing law of the various country in which we provide service or solution may offer only limited intellectual property protection of our service or solution and the protection in some country may be very limited we rely upon combination of confidentiality policy and procedure

further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection there is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and

or deter competitor former employee or other third party from reverse engineering our solution or proprietary methodology and process or independently developing service or solution similar to or duplicative of ours further the step we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitor former employee

policy and procedure to respect the intellectual property right of third party and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property we may not be aware if our employee have misappropriated and or misused intellectual property and their action could result in claim of intellectual property misappropriation and or infringement from third party these claim could harm our reputation cause to incur substantial cost or prevent from offering some service or solution in the future any related proceeding could require to expend significant resource over an extended period of time in most of our contract we agree to indemnify our client for expense and liability resulting from claimed infringement of the intellectual property right of third party in some instance the amount of these indemnity could be greater than the revenue we receive from the client any claim or litigation in this area could be time consuming and costly damage our reputation and or require to incur additional cost to obtain the right to continue to offer service or solution to our client if we can not secure this right at all or on reasonable term or we are unable to implement in cost effective manner

revenue in accordance with fasb asu no revenue from contract with customer topic which we adopted on september using the modified retrospective method table of contentsnotes to consolidated financial statement continued in thousand of dollar except share and per share amount or otherwise disclosed accenture form kf obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the client and is the unit of accounting in topic contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus margin approach under which we forecast our expected cost of satisfying performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service based on margin for similar service sold on standalone basis while determining relative standalone selling price and identifying separate performance obligation require judgment generally relative standalone selling price and the separate performance obligation are readily identifiable we sell those performance obligation unaccompanied by other performance obligation contract modification are routine in the performance of our contract contract are often modified to account for change in the contract specification requirement or duration if contract modification result in the addition of performance obligation priced at standalone selling price or if the post modification service are distinct from the service provided prior to the modification the modification is accounted for separately if the modified service are not distinct they are accounted for part of the existing contract our revenue are derived from contract for outsourcing service technology integration consulting service and non technology integration consulting service these contract have different term based on the scope performance obligation and complexity of the engagement which frequently require to make judgment and estimate in recognizing revenue we have many type of contract including time and material contract fixed price contract fee per transaction contract and contract with multiple fee type the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including incentive fee many contract include incentive or penalty related to cost incurred benefit produced or adherence to schedule that may increase the variability in revenue and margin earned on such contract these variable amount generally are awarded or refunded upon achievement of or failure to achieve certain performance metric milestone or cost target and can be based upon client discretion we include these variable fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee and it is not probable significant reversal of revenue will occur these estimate reflect the expected value of the variable fee and are based on an assessment of our anticipated performance historical experience and other information available at the time our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time the majority of our revenue are recognized over time based on the extent of progress towards satisfying our performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the contract and the nature of the service to be provided outsourcing contract our outsourcing contract typically span several year

estimate estimate of total contract revenue and cost are continuously monitored over the life of our contract and recorded revenue and cost estimate are subject to revision the contract progress if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on technology integration consulting contract we recognize the loss in the quarter it first becomes probable and
