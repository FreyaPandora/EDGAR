legislative and regulatory proposal concerning data protection including measure to ensure that encryption of user data not hinder law enforcement agency access to that data in addition the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection law in the europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and in flux it is possible that these law may be interpreted and applied in manner that is inconsistent with our data practice these legislative and regulatory proposal if adopted and such interpretation could in addition to the possibility of fine result in an order requiring that we change our data practice which could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation complying with these various law could cause to incur substantial cost or require to change our business practice in manner adverse to our business recent legal development in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfer of personal data from europe to the united state for example the general data protection regulation gdpr became effective in the european union eu beginning on may and applies to all of our activity conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to product and service that we offer to eu user or customer or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu the gdpr subject to range of new compliance obligation ensuring compliance with the gdpr is an ongoing commitment which involves substantial cost and it is possible that despite our effort governmental authority or third party will assert that our business practice fail to comply we have been and may in the future be subject to lawsuit alleging violation of the gdpr if our operation are found to be in violation of the gdpr requirement we may be required to change our business practice and or be subject to significant civil penalty business disruption and reputational harm any of which could have material adverse effect on our business in particular serious breach of the gdpr can result in administrative fine of up to the higher of of annual worldwide revenue or million fine of up to the higher of of annual worldwide revenue or million can be levied for other

company that self certify to the department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with the privacy shield requirement to freely import personal data from the eu and switzerland however these framework face number of legal challenge and their validity remains subject to legal regulatory and political development in both europe and the this ha resulted in some uncertainty and compliance obligation could cause to incur cost or require to change our business practice in manner adverse to our business we are and may in the future be subject to intellectual property or other claim which are costly to defend could result in significant damage award and could limit our ability to use certain technology in the future many company in particular those in internet technology and medium large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and frequently enter into litigation based on allegation of infringement or other violation of intellectual property right in addition patent holding company may continue to seek to monetize patent they have purchased or otherwise obtained by bringing claim against whether such claim are meritorious or not we have grown the number of intellectual property claim against ha increased and may continue to increase we develop new product service and technology we have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuit filed against claiming that certain of our product service and technology infringe the intellectual property right of others third party have also sought broad injunctive relief against by filing claim in and international court and the international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist order which could limit our ability to sell our product or service in the or elsewhere if our product or service or those of our customer or supplier are found to of contentsalphabet inc infringe the intellectual property subject to the claim adverse result in any of these lawsuit may include award of substantial monetary damage costly royalty or licensing agreement if license are available at all or order preventing from offering certain feature functionality product or service and may also cause to change our business practice and require development of non infringing product service or technology which could result in loss of revenue for and otherwise harm our business many of our agreement with our customer and partner including certain supplier require to defend against certain intellectual property infringement claim and or indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claim against them which could result in increased cost for defending such claim or significant damage if there were an adverse ruling in any such claim such customer and partner may also discontinue the use of our product service and technology result of injunction or otherwise which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business moreover intellectual property indemnity provided to by our supplier when obtainable may not cover all damage and loss suffered by and our customer arising from intellectual property infringement claim brought against furthermore in connection with our divestiture we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liability including those associated with intellectual property claim regardless of their merit intellectual property claim are often time consuming expensive to litigate or settle and cause significant diversion of management attention to the extent such claim are successful they may have an adverse effect on our business including our product and service offering consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow our intellectual property right are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our product service and brand well affect our ability to compete our patent trademark trade secret copyright and other intellectual property right are important asset for various event outside of our control pose threat to our intellectual property right well to our product service and technology for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our product and service are distributed or made available through the internet also the effort we have taken to protect our proprietary right may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovation it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovation moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovation that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our effort that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property trade secret the secrecy of such trade secret and other sensitive information could be compromised by outside party or by our employee which could cause to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secret we also face risk associated with our trademark for example there is risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search some court have ruled that google is protectable trademark however it is possible that other court particularly those outside of the united state may reach different determination if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own product thus diminishing our brand any significant impairment of our intellectual property right could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property right is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating result acquisition joint venture investment and divestiture could result in operating difficulty dilution and other consequence that may adversely affect our business and result of operation acquisition joint venture investment and divestiture are important element of our overall corporate strategy and use of capital and these transaction could be material to our financial condition and result of operation we expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussion regarding wide array of potential strategic transaction effecting these strategic transaction could create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure the area where we face risk include among others diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to challenge related to acquisition and other strategic transaction failure to successfully further develop the acquired business or technology implementation or remediation of control procedure and policy at the acquired company of contentsalphabet inc integration of the acquired company accounting human resource and other administrative system and coordination of product engineering and sale and marketing function transition of operation user and customer onto our existing platform failure to obtain required approval on timely basis if at all from governmental authority or condition placed upon approval that could among other thing delay or prevent from completing transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goal of an acquisition or other strategic transaction in the case of foreign acquisition the need to integrate operation across different culture and language and to address the particular economic currency political and regulatory risk associated with specific country cultural challenge associated with integrating employee from the acquired company into our organization and retention of employee from the business we acquire liability for activity of the acquired company before the acquisition including patent and trademark infringement claim privacy issue violation of law commercial dispute tax liability and other known and unknown liability litigation or other claim in connection with the acquired company including claim from terminated employee customer former stockholder or other third party our failure to address these risk or other problem encountered in connection with our past or future acquisition and other strategic transaction could cause to fail to realize their anticipated benefit incur unanticipated liability and harm our business generally our acquisition and other strategic transaction could also result in dilutive issuance of our equity security the incurrence of debt contingent liability or amortization expense or impairment of goodwill and or purchased long lived asset and restructuring charge any of which could harm our financial condition or result also the anticipated benefit or value of our acquisition and other strategic transaction may not materialize in connection with our divestiture we have agreed and may in the future agree to provide indemnification for certain potential liability which may adversely affect our financial condition or result our business depends on strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand

our success will depend largely on our ability to remain technology leader and continue to provide high quality innovative product and service that are truly useful and play meaningful role in people everyday life we face number of manufacturing and supply chain risk that if not properly managed could adversely affect our financial result and prospect we face number of risk related to

manufacture many of our assembly and finished product third party arrangement for the design of some component and part and third party distributor including cellular network carrier our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third party with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of our arrangement with them of contentsalphabet inc we may experience supply shortage and price

increased storm severity and significant change in the financial or business condition of our supplier we may experience shortage or other supply chain disruption in the future that could negatively affect our operation in addition some of the component we use in our technical infrastructure and product are available only from single source or limited source and we may not be able to find replacement vendor on favorable term or at all in the event of supply chain disruption in addition significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrade or expansion we may enter into long term contract that commit to significant term and condition of supply we may be liable for material and product that is not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescence quality product recall and warranty issue for instance because many of our hardware supply contract have volume based pricing or minimum purchase requirement if the volume of our hardware sale decrease or doe not reach projected target we could face increased material and manufacturing cost or other financial liability that could make our product more costly per unit to manufacture and therefore le competitive and negatively affect our financial result furthermore certain of our competitor may negotiate more favorable contractual term based on volume and other commitment that may provide them with competitive advantage and may affect our supply the product and service we sell or offer may have quality issue resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other manufacturer or supplier if the quality of our product and service doe not meet our user and or customer expectation or our product or service are found to be defective our sale and operating earnings and ultimately our reputation could be negatively affected we also require our supplier and business partner to comply with law and where applicable our company policy such the google supplier code of conduct regarding workplace and employment practice data security environmental compliance and

take measure including legal action that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our product by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offering or by charging increased fee to or our user to provide our offering some jurisdiction have adopted regulation prohibiting certain form of discrimination by internet access provider however substantial uncertainty exists in the united state and elsewhere regarding such protection for example in the united state the federal communication commission repealed net neutrality rule effective june which could lead internet access provider to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service in addition in some jurisdiction our product and service have been subject to government initiated restriction or blockage such interference could result in loss of existing user customer and advertiser goodwill and increased cost and could impair our ability to attract new user customer and advertiser thereby harming our revenue and growth new and existing technology could affect our ability to customize ad and or could block ad online which

market and industry factor may harm the market price of our class common stock and our class capital stock regardless of our actual operating performance we can not guarantee that any share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that any share repurchase program will enhance long term stockholder value and share repurchase could increase the volatility of the price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserve in and the board of director of alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to billion and billion of it class capital stock respectively the authorization wa completed

within our portfolio requires judgment based on the right and obligation of the security recording upward and downward adjustment to the carrying value of our equity security result of observable price change requires quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security using various valuation methodology and involves the use of estimate non marketable equity security are also subject to periodic impairment review our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant effect on the investment fair value qualitative factor considered include industry and market condition financial performance business prospect and other relevant event and factor when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessment of the fair value of our equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market

disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to financial market risk including change in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity investment risk foreign currency exchange riskwe transact business globally in multiple currency our international revenue well cost and expense denominated in foreign currency expose to the risk of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate against the dollar principal currency hedged included the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro and japanese yen for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trend in foreign currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that adverse change in exchange rate of could be experienced in the near term we use foreign exchange forward contract to offset the foreign exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the local currency of the subsidiary these forward contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movement on our asset and liability the foreign currency gain and loss on the asset and liability are recorded in other income expense net which are offset by the gain and loss on the forward contract if an adverse foreign currency exchange rate change wa applied to total monetary asset and liability denominated in currency other than the local currency at the balance sheet date it would have resulted in an adverse effect on income before income tax of approximately million and million of december and respectively the adverse effect of december and is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately million for both period from foreign exchange contract in place for the month ended december and december we use foreign currency forward and option contract including collar an option strategy comprised of combination of purchased and written option to protect our forecasted dollar equivalent earnings from change in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens gain from foreign currency option and forward reduce the foreign currency loss related to our earnings when the dollar weakens loss from foreign currency collar and forward offset the foreign currency gain related to our earnings these hedging contract reduce but do of contentsalphabet inc not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movement we designate these contract cash flow hedge for accounting purpose we reflect the gain or loss of foreign currency spot rate change component of aoci and subsequently reclassify them into revenue to offset the hedged exposure they occur if the dollar weakened by of december and december the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign exchange contract before tax effect would have been approximately million and million lower of december and december respectively the change in the value recorded in aoci would be expected to offset corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenue when recognized during we entered into foreign exchange forward contract designated net investment hedge to hedge the foreign currency risk related to our investment in foreign subsidiary these forward contract serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operation if the dollar weakened by the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment cta within aoci related to our net investment hedge would have been approximately million lower of december the change in value recorded in cta would be expected to offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain or loss from our investment in foreign subsidiary interest rate riskour investment strategy is to achieve return that will allow to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirement we invest primarily in debt security including those of the government and it agency corporate debt security mortgage backed security money market and other fund municipal security time deposit asset backed security and debt instrument issued by foreign government by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer our investment in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning security carry degree of interest rate risk fixed rate security may have their fair market value adversely affected due to rise in interest rate while floating rate security may produce le income than predicted if interest rate fall unrealized gain or loss on our marketable debt security are primarily due to interest rate fluctuation result of higher market interest rate compared to interest rate at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate security at fair value with gain and loss recorded in aoci until the security are sold we use value at risk var analysis to determine the potential effect of fluctuation in interest rate on the value of our marketable debt security portfolio the var is the expected loss in fair value for given confidence interval for our investment portfolio due to adverse movement in interest rate we use variance covariance var model with confidence interval the estimated one day loss in fair value of our marketable debt security of december and are shown below in million of december month average of december category interest rate future gain and loss associated with our marketable debt security portfolio may differ materially from the sensitivity analysis performed of december and due to the inherent limitation associated with predicting the timing and amount of change in interest rate and our actual exposure and position var analysis is not intended to represent actual loss but is used risk estimation equity investment riskour marketable and non marketable equity security are subject to wide variety of market related risk that could substantially reduce or increase the fair value of our holding our marketable equity security are publicly traded stock or fund and our non marketable equity security are investment in privately held company some of which are in the startup or development stage we record our marketable equity security not accounted for under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market value of which publicly traded stock and mutual fund are subject to market price volatility and represent billion of our investment of december hypothetical adverse price change of which could be experienced in the near term would decrease the fair value of our marketable equity security by million our non marketable equity security not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted to fair value for observable transaction for identical or similar investment of the same issuer or impairment referred to the of contentsalphabet inc measurement alternative the fair value is measured at the time of the observable transaction which is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value of the balance sheet date these investment especially those that are in the early stage are inherently risky because the technology or product these company have under development are typically in the early phase and may never materialize and they may experience decline in financial condition which could result in loss of substantial part of our investment in these company the success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize value in our investment through liquidity event such public offering acquisition private sale or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment of december the carrying value of our non marketable equity security which were accounted for under the measurement alternative wa billion valuation of our equity investment in private company are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data volatility in the global economic climate and financial market could result in significant impairment charge on our non marketable equity security the carrying value of our equity method investment generally do not fluctuate based on market price change however these investment could be impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value for further information about our equity investment please refer to

implementation effort in june the fasb issued accounting standard update no asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit loss for financial asset held at amortized cost asu replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward looking information to calculate credit loss estimate it also eliminates the concept of other than temporary impairment and requires credit loss related to available for sale debt security to be recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security these change will result in earlier recognition of credit loss we will adopt asu

billed to our customer of contentsalphabet inc are recorded revenue and amount paid to google network member are recorded cost of revenue where we are the principal we control the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customer our control is evidenced by our sole ability to monetize the advertising inventory before it is transferred to our customer and is further supported by being primarily responsible to our customer and level of discretion in establishing pricing other revenuesgoogle other revenue and other bet revenue consist primarily of revenue from apps in app purchase and digital content in the google play store google cloud offering hardware and other miscellaneous product and service it relates to google other revenue the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sale and in app purchase through the google play store we report revenue from these transaction on net basis because our performance obligation is to facilitate transaction between app developer and end user for which we earn commission consequently the portion of the gross amount billed to end user that is remitted to app developer is not reflected revenue arrangement with multiple performance obligationsour contract with customer may include multiple performance obligation for such arrangement we allocate revenue to each performance obligation based on it relative standalone selling price we generally determine standalone selling price based on the price charged to customer or using expected cost plus margin customer incentive and creditscertain customer may receive cash based incentive or credit which are accounted for variable consideration we estimate these amount based on the expected amount to be provided to customer and reduce revenue recognized we believe that there will not be significant change to our estimate of variable consideration deferred revenueswe record deferred revenue when cash payment are received or due in advance of our performance including amount which are refundable the increase in the deferred revenue balance for the twelve month ended december is primarily driven by cash payment received or due in advance of satisfying our performance obligation offset by billion of revenue recognized that were included in the deferred revenue balance of december our payment term vary by the type and location of our customer and the product or service offered the term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant for certain product or service and customer type we require payment before the product or service are delivered to the customer practical expedient and exemptionswe generally expense sale commission when incurred because the amortization period

to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax we continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussion with tax authority and the effect if any of the expected expiration of the statute of limitation in various taxing jurisdiction we believe that an adequate provision ha been made for any adjustment that may result from tax examination however the outcome of tax audit can not be predicted with certainty if any issue addressed in our tax audit are resolved in manner not consistent with management expectation we could be required to adjust our provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs although the timing of resolution settlement and closure of audit is not certain it is reasonably possible that certain federal and non tax audit may be concluded within
