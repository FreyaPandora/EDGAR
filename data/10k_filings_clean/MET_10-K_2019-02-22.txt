by the naic and adopted by their respective state of domicile rbc is based on formula calculated by applying factor to various asset premium claim expense and statutory reserve item the formula take into account the risk characteristic of the insurer and is calculated on an annual basis the major category of risk involved are asset risk insurance risk interest rate risk market risk and business risk the formula is used an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurer for purpose of initiating regulatory action and not mean to rank insurer generally state insurance law provide insurance regulator the authority to require various action by or take various action against insurer whose total adjusted capital doe not meet or exceed certain rbc level of the date of the most recent annual statutory financial statement filed with insurance regulator the total adjusted capital of each of our subsidiary subject to these requirement wa in excess of each of those rbc level see statutory equity and income in note of the note to the consolidated financial statement and management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource the company capital statutory capital and dividend in december president trump signed into law commonly referred to the tax cut and job act of tax reform following the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate pursuant to tax reform the naic adopted revision to certain factor used to calculate life rbc which is the denominator of the rbc ratio these revision to the naic life rbc calculation have resulted in increase in rbc charge and reduction in the rbc ratio of our insurance subsidiary the naic is also studying rbc revision for bond real estate and longevity risk but it is premature to project the impact of any potential regulatory change resulting from such proposal the naic is continuing to develop group capital calculation tool using an rbc aggregation methodology for all entity within the insurance holding company system including non entity the goal is to provide regulator with method to aggregate the available capital and the minimum capital of each entity in group in way that applies to all group regardless of their structure the naic expects to conduct field testing in the first half of the naic ha stated that the calculation will be regulatory tool and will not constitute requirement or standard nonetheless any new group capital calculation methodology may incorporate existing rbc concept it is not possible to predict what impact any such regulatory tool may have on our business while not required by or filed with insurance regulator we calculate internally defined combined rbc ratio which are determined by dividing the sum of total adjusted capital for metlife inc principal insurance subsidiary excluding american life insurance company american life by the sum of company action level rbc for such subsidiary we calculate such combined rbc ratio based on naic capital and reserving requirement naic based combined rbc ratio the naic based combined rbc ratio wa in excess of at december and in excess of at december the change due to tax reform discussed above were the primary driver of the reduction with the exception of change related to the naic principle based reserving framework

state law derivative regulationdodd frank includes framework of regulation of the over the counter otc derivative market which requires clearing of certain type of transaction currently traded otc and which imposes additional cost including reporting and margin requirement our cost of risk mitigation are increasing under dodd frank for example dodd frank imposes requirement to pledge variation and or initial margin for otc cleared transaction otc derivative that are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties and ii for otc bilateral transaction otc derivative that are bilateral contract between two counterparties the margin requirement for otc cleared transaction and the variation margin requirement for otc bilateral derivative are already in effect while the initial margin requirement for otc bilateral transaction will likely be applicable to in september these increased margin requirement combined with increased capital charge for our counterparties and central clearinghouses with respect to non cash collateral will likely require increased holding of cash and highly liquid security with lower yield causing reduction in income and le favorable pricing for otc cleared and otc bilateral transaction centralized clearing of certain otc derivative expose to the risk of default by clearing member or clearinghouse with respect to our cleared derivative transaction we use derivative to mitigate wide range of risk in connection with our business including the impact of increased benefit exposure from certain of our annuity product that offer guaranteed benefit we have always been subject to the risk that hedging and other management procedure might prove ineffective in reducing the risk to which insurance policy expose or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality combined with adverse market event could produce economic loss beyond the scope of the risk management technique employed any such loss could be increased by higher cost of writing derivative including customized derivative and the reduced availability of customized derivative that might result from the implementation of dodd frank and

enter into are subject to these new rule it could limit our recovery in the event of default and increase our counterparty risk the amount of collateral we are required to pledge and the payment we

private letter ruling from the irs regarding certain significant issue under the code well an opinion from tax counsel that the distribution qualified for non recognition of gain or loss to and our shareholder pursuant to section and of the code except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional share each subject to the accuracy of and compliance with certain representation assumption and covenant therein notwithstanding the receipt of the private letter ruling and the tax opinion the irs could determine that the distribution should be treated taxable transaction for example if it determines that any of the representation assumption or covenant on which the private letter ruling is based are untrue or have been violated similarly the irs could determine that our disposal of fvo brighthouse common stock defined below in the debt for equity exchange should be treated taxable transaction to metlife inc furthermore part of the irs policy the irs did not determine whether the distribution or the debt for equity exchange satisfies certain condition that are necessary to qualify for non recognition treatment rather the private letter ruling is based on representation by and brighthouse that these condition have been satisfied the tax opinion addressed the satisfaction of these condition the tax opinion is not binding on the irs or the court and there can be no assurance that the irs or court will not take contrary position in addition the tax counsel relied on certain representation and covenant delivered by and brighthouse if the irs ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable the distribution could be treated taxable dividend or capital gain to metlife shareholder who received share of brighthouse financial inc common stock in the distribution for federal income tax purpose and such shareholder could incur significant federal income tax liability in addition if the irs ultimately determines that the distribution is taxable we and brighthouse could incur significant federal income tax liability and either we or brighthouse could have an indemnification obligation to the other depending on the circumstance even if the spin off distribution otherwise qualifies for non recognition of gain or loss under section of the code it may be taxable to but not our shareholder under section of the code if or more by vote or value of our common stock or brighthouse financial inc common stock is acquired part of plan or series of related transaction that include the distribution for this purpose any acquisition of our or brighthouse financial inc common stock within two year before or after the distribution are presumed to be part of such plan although we or brighthouse may be able to rebut that presumption based on either applicable fact and circumstance or safe harbor described in the tax regulation therefore under the tax separation agreement with brighthouse we are restricted from certain activity and have indemnity obligation which

insurance company have higher claim paying ability rating in the united state and japan we compete with large number of domestic and foreign owned life insurance company many of which offer product in category on which we focus elsewhere we compete with the foreign insurance operation of large insurer and with global insurance group and local company many of our group insurance product are underwritten annually and accordingly there is risk that group purchaser may be able to obtain more favorable term from competitor rather than renewing coverage with we believe that the continued volatility of the financial market and it impact on the capital position of many competitor will continue to strain the competitive environment although the regulatory environment ha improved at the federal level the life insurance industry continues to face challenge globally and within the at the state level in the current environment we believe that financial strength technological efficiency and organizational agility are the most significant differentiator and that we are building company that is well positioned to succeed in any environment for example the company primarily distributes it product through variety of third party distribution channel including bank and broker dealer these distribution partner are currently placing greater emphasis on the financial strength of the

our product principally traditional life universal life fixed annuity gics funding agreement and structured settlement expose to the risk that change in interest rate including reduction in the difference between short term and long term interest rate could reduce our investment margin or spread which could in turn reduce our net income in low interest rate environment we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investment that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yield which could reduce our investment spread moreover borrower may prepay or redeem the fixed income security and commercial agricultural or residential mortgage loan in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rate thereby exacerbating this risk although lowering interest crediting rate can help offset decrease in spread on some product our ability to lower these rate is limited to the portion of our in force product portfolio that ha adjustable interest crediting rate and could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rate and may not match the timing or magnitude of change in asset yield result our spread could decrease or potentially become negative which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition significantly lower spread may cause to accelerate amortization thereby reducing net income and potentially negatively affecting our credit instrument covenant or rating agency assessment of our financial condition in addition during period of declining interest rate life insurance and annuity product may be relatively more attractive investment to consumer this could result in increased premium payment on product with flexible premium feature repayment of policy loan and increased persistency during period when our new investment carry lower return decline in market interest rate could also reduce our return on investment that do not support particular policy obligation during period of sustained lower interest rate our reserve for policy liability may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligation and may need to be strengthened accordingly declining

profitability of contentsincreases in interest rate could also negatively affect our profitability in period of rapidly increasing interest rate we may not be able to replace in timely manner the investment in our general account with higher yielding investment needed to fund the higher crediting rate necessary to keep interest rate sensitive product competitive we therefore may have to accept lower spread and thus lower profitability or face decline in sale and greater loss of existing contract and related asset in addition policy loan surrender and withdrawal may increase policyholder seek investment with higher perceived return interest rate rise this process may result in cash outflow requiring that we sell investment at time when the price of those investment are adversely affected by the increase in interest rate which may result in realized investment loss unanticipated withdrawal termination and substantial policy amendment may cause to accelerate the amortization of dac and value of business acquired voba which reduces net income and potentially negatively affect our credit instrument covenant and rating agency assessment of our financial condition and may also cause to accelerate the amortization of negative voba which increase net income an increase in interest rate could also have material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio for example by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income security additionally an increase in interest rate could increase our daily settlement payment on interest rate future and cleared swap which may result in increased cash outflow and increase our liquidity need furthermore if interest rate rise our unrealized gain on fixed income security would decrease and our unrealized loss would increase perhaps substantially the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed income security would be recognized in net income when gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the security or if the decline in estimated fair value is determined to be other than temporary and an impairment charge to earnings is taken finally an increase in interest rate could result in decreased fee income associated with decline in the value of variable annuity account balance invested in fixed income fund action resulting from the monetary policy of the federal reserve board and of central bank around the world including with respect to interest rate may also impact the pricing level of risk bearing investment and may adversely impact the income we earn on our investment or the level of

investment relative to our interest rate sensitive liability for some of our liability portfolio it is not possible to invest asset to the full liability duration thereby creating some asset liability

enhanced our ability to focus on the right market build clear differentiator and continue to make the right investment to deliver shareholder value post separation we are well positioned in le volatile and fee based business result we expect our result to be le sensitive to interest rate assuming interest rate follow the observable forward yield curve of the year ended december we expect the average ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings over the two year period of and to be to assuming year treasury rate between and we believe that free cash flow is key determinant of common stock dividend and common stock repurchase in light of the move away from sustained low interest rate environment compounding business growth and our expense initiative we are targeting an adjusted return on equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income aoci other than foreign currency translation adjustment fcta of to over the near term this target reflects our unit cost improvement program and the related initiative to invest billion by to generate pre tax profit margin improvement of million which represents an approximate basis point decline in our direct expense ratio excluding total notable item related to direct expense and pension risk transfer by from our baseline year key element of our enterprise strategy is to return excess capital to common shareholder

in the first half of argentina reported inflation rate began to increase dramatically and the argentine central bank significantly increased interest rate in an effort to combat inflation based on argentina reported inflation rate and trend of july we designated argentina highly inflationary economy for accounting purpose the change to highly inflationary accounting did not have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement for the year ended december industry trendswe continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment that ha been affecting the industry financial and economic environmentour business and result of operation are materially affected by condition in the global capital market and the economy generally stressed condition volatility and disruption in global capital market particular market or financial asset class can have an adverse effect on in part because we have large investment portfolio and our insurance liability and derivative are sensitive to changing market factor see risk factor economic environment and capital market risk difficult economic condition may adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we have market presence in numerous country and therefore our business operation are exposed to risk posed by local and regional economic condition for example metlife is the largest provider of benefit to mexican federal government personnel and public official however the new administration of president lópez obrador of mexico is implementing an austerity plan which among other measure ha eliminated benefit such major medical insurance and contribution to additional saving benefit insurance for such individual see business regulation fiscal measure and risk factor economic environment and capital market risk difficult economic condition may adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition currency exchange rate risk see executive summary other key information argentina highly inflationary for further information regarding the impact of argentina highly inflationary economy on the company consolidated financial statement of contentswe are closely monitoring political and economic condition that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operation investment portfolio and derivative for example event following the referendum on june and the uncertainty including foreign currency exchange risk associated with it planned withdrawal from the eu have contributed to global market volatility these factor could contribute to weakening gross domestic product growth primarily in the and to lesser degree in continental europe the magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impact would depend on the detailed agreement reached by the and the eu result of the negotiation regarding future trade and other arrangement see investment current environment selected country and sector investment we are also monitoring the imposition of tariff or other barrier to international trade change to international trade agreement and their potential impact on our business result of operation and financial condition in addition the possibility of additional government shutdown or failure to raise the debt ceiling due to policy impasse or otherwise could adversely impact our business and liquidity see business regulation cross border trade and business regulation fiscal measure see also risk factor economic environment and capital market risk difficult economic condition may adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition and risk factor business risk the global nature of our operation expose to variety of political legal operational economic and other risk central bank around the world are using monetary policy to address regional economic condition for example in the united state citing strengthening economy the federal reserve board ha continued along it stated path of balance sheet tapering and the federal reserve board federal open market committee ha continued to increase the federal fund rate most recently in december similarly recognizing the economic recovery the european central bank ended quantitative easing in december and left interest rate unchanged in japan however the japanese government and the bank of japan are maintaining stimulus measure in order to boost inflation expectation and achieve sustainable economic growth in japan such measure include the imposition of negative rate on commercial bank deposit continued government bond purchase and tax reform including the lowering of the japanese corporate tax rate and the delay until october of an increase in the consumption tax to going forward japan structural and demographic challenge may continue to limit it potential growth unless reform that boost productivity are put into place japan high public sector debt level are mitigated by low refinancing risk further action by central bank in the future may affect interest rate and risk market in the europe japan and other developed and emerging economy and may ultimately result in market volatility we can not predict with certainty the effect of these action or the impact on our business operation investment portfolio or derivative see investment current environment impact of sustained low interest rate environment during sustained period of low interest rate we may have to invest insurance cash flow and reinvest the cash flow we received interest or return of principal on our investment in lower yielding instrument moreover borrower may prepay or redeem the fixed income security mortgage loan and mortgage backed security in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rate therefore some of our product expose to the risk that reduction in interest rate will reduce the difference between the amount that we are required to credit on contract in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on investment intended to support obligation under these contract this difference between interest earned and interest credited or margin is key metric for the management of and reporting for many of our business our expectation regarding future margin are an important component impacting the amortization of certain intangible asset such dac and voba significantly lower margin may cause to accelerate the amortization thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period additionally lower margin may also impact the recoverability of intangible asset such goodwill require the establishment of additional liability or trigger loss recognition event on certain policyholder liability we review this long term margin assumption along with other assumption part of our annual actuarial assumption review see result of operation consolidated result year ended december compared with the year ended december actuarial assumption review and certain other insurance adjustment for further information some of our separate account product including variable annuity have certain minimum guarantee benefit declining interest rate increase the reserve we need to set up to protect the guarantee benefit thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period of contentsmitigating actionsthe company continues to be proactive in it investment and interest crediting rate strategy well it product design and product mix to mitigate the risk of unfavorable consequence from the low interest rate environment in the the company applies disciplined asset liability management alm strategy including the use of interest rate derivative in some case the company ha entered into offsetting position part of it overall alm strategy and to reduce volatility in net income lowering interest crediting rate on some product or adjusting the dividend scale on traditional product can help offset decrease in investment margin on some product our ability to lower interest crediting rate could be limited by competition requirement to obtain regulatory approval or contractual guarantee of minimum rate and may not match the timing or magnitude of change in asset yield result our margin could decrease or potentially become negative we are able to limit or close certain product to new sale in order to manage exposure business action such shifting the sale focus to le interest rate sensitive product can also mitigate this risk in addition the company is well diversified across product distribution and geography certain of our business reported within our latin america emea and asia exclusive of our japan business segment are not significantly interest rate or market sensitive in particular they have limited sensitivity to interest rate the company primary exposure within these segment is insurance risk we expect our non business to grow faster than our business and over time to become larger percentage of our total business result of the foregoing the company expects to be able to substantially mitigate the negative impact of sustained low interest rate environment in the on the company profitability based on near to intermediate term analysis of sustained lower interest rate environment in the the company anticipates adjusted earnings will continue to increase although at slower growth rate low interest rate scenario in formulating economic assumption for it insurance contract assumption the company us projection that it make regarding interest rate included in these assumption is the projection that the year treasury rate will rise from at december to in year by and remains level afterwards and that year yield will reach and by december and respectively also included is the projection that the three month libor rate will move from at december to and by december and respectively the low interest rate scenario reflects an assumed basis point decline in all interest rate maturity compared to the base scenario from december through december the low interest rate scenario the following summarizes the impact of the low interest rate scenario on our dollar and non dollar denominated position in addition we have included disclosure on the potential impact on and net income using the same low interest rate scenario on the mark to market of derivative position that do not qualify accounting hedge below is summary of the rate we used for the low interest rate scenario versus our base scenario through these rate represent the most relevant short term and long term rate for our base scenario which us libor the benchmark rate see risk factor economic environment and capital risk difficult economic condition may adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition interest rate risk for information regarding the potential change from libor to sofr low interest rate scenario base scenario low interest rate scenario base scenario low interest rate scenario base scenariothree month year the low interest rate scenario assumes the three month libor to be and the year treasury rate to be at december we assume the low interest rate scenario to be basis point lower than the base scenario until december for all interest rate maturity in addition in the low interest rate scenario we assume credit spread to remain constant from december through the end of compared to our base scenario further we also include the impact of low interest rate on our pension and postretirement plan expense we allocate this impact across our segment and it is included in the segment discussion below the discount rate used to value these plan is tied to high quality corporate bond yield accordingly an extended low interest rate environment will result in increased pension and other postretirement benefit liability however these liability are offset by corresponding return on the fixed income portfolio of pension and other postretirement benefit plan asset resulting in an overall decrease in expense of contentshypothetical impact to adjusted earningsbased on the above assumption we estimate an unfavorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on our consolidated adjusted earnings from the low interest rate scenario of approximately million in million in and million in under the low interest rate scenario our long term business are negatively impacted by the larger gap between new money yield and the yield on asset rolling off the portfolio however there are positive offset under the low interest rate scenario short term rate are much lower than the base scenario rate and the yield curve steepens beyond for example our security lending business performs better than our base scenario because it is driven by the slope of the yield curve rather than by the level of interest rate in addition derivative income is higher primarily due to our receiver swap where we receive fixed rate and pay floating rate further the favorable derivative impact under the low interest rate scenario will decrease in and compared to this is driven by higher rate on forward derivative position protection that begin in hypothetical impact to our mark to market derivative positionsin addition to it impact on adjusted earnings we estimated the effect of the low interest rate scenario on the mark to market of our derivative position that do not qualify accounting hedge we applied the low interest rate scenario to these derivative and compared the impact to that from interest rate in our base scenario we hold significant position in long duration receive fixed interest rate swap to hedge reinvestment risk these swap are most sensitive to the year and year swap rate and we recognize gain rate drop and recognize loss rate rise this estimated impact on the derivative mark to market doe not include that of our va program derivative the impact of low interest rate in the freestanding derivative would be largely offset by the mark to market in net derivative gain loss for the related embedded derivative based on these additional assumption we estimate the combined long term and short term interest rate impact of the low interest rate scenario on the mark to market of our derivative position that do not qualify accounting hedge to be an increase in net income of million in and decline in net income of million in and million in see result of operation consolidated result for information regarding our actual gain and loss on the company non va program derivative due to interest rate change which are included in net income segment and corporate otherthe following discussion summarizes the impact of the above low interest rate scenario on the adjusted earnings of our segment well corporate other see also policyholder liability policyholder account balance for information regarding the account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rate group benefitsin general most of our group life insurance product in the segment are renewable term insurance and therefore have significant repricing flexibility interest rate risk arises mainly from minimum interest rate guarantee on retained asset account these account have minimum interest crediting rate guarantee which range from to approximately half of these account balance are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rate and we would expect to experience margin compression we reinvest at lower interest rate we have used interest rate derivative to partially mitigate the risk of sustained low interest rate environment we also have exposure to interest rate risk in this business arising from our disability policy claim reserve for these product lower reinvestment rate can not be offset by reduction in liability crediting rate for established claim reserve group disability policy are generally renewable term policy rate may be adjusted on in force policy at renewal based on the retrospective experience rating and current interest rate assumption we estimate favorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on the adjusted earnings of our group benefit business from the low interest rate scenario of million million and million in and respectively of contentsretirement and income solutionsris contains both short and long duration product consisting of capital market product pension risk transfer structured settlement and other benefit funding product significant portion of short duration product are managed on floating rate basis which mitigates the impact of the low interest rate environment in the the sensitivity below do not include the impact of additional alm action that we may take in our capital market business the long duration product have very predictable cash flow and our strategy is to match asset and liability duration consistent with our alm policy we also use interest rate swap part of our alm strategy and to help protect income in this business while we expect to experience margin compression we reinvest at lower rate the interest rate derivative and the alm strategy this portfolio follows should partially mitigate this risk also based on cash flow estimate only small component of the invested asset base is subject to reinvestment risk reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose the amount of reinvestment in and that would impact adjusted earnings due to reinvesting cash flow in the low interest rate scenario we estimate an unfavorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on adjusted earnings on our ri business from the low interest rate scenario of million million and million in and respectively property casualtythe product portfolio within property casualty is primarily made up of six month and annual term renewable policy which allow for significant re pricing flexibility with no policyholder benefit tied to interest rate result the interest rate risk for the property casualty business is minimal tied only to our portfolio reinvestment rate and our ability to offset the change of those rate through re pricing effort we estimate an unfavorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on adjusted earnings on our property casualty business from the low interest rate scenario of million million and million in and respectively asiaour japan business offer traditional life insurance and accident health product many of which are denominated in dollar to the extent the japan life insurance portfolio is interest rate and libor sensitive and we are unable to lower crediting rate to the customer adjusted earnings will decline we manage interest rate risk on our life product through combination of product design feature and alm strategy we sell annuity in japan which are predominantly single premium product with crediting rate set at the time of issue this allows to tightly manage product alm cash flow and net spread thus maintaining profitability we estimate an unfavorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on the adjusted earnings of our asia segment from the low interest rate scenario of million million and million in and respectively metlife holdingsour interest rate sensitive life product include traditional and universal life product because the majority of our traditional life insurance business is participating we can largely offset lower investment return on asset backing our traditional life product through adjustment to the applicable dividend scale in our universal life product we manage interest rate risk through combination of product design feature and alm strategy including the use of interest rate derivative hedge while we have the ability to lower crediting rate on certain in force universal life policy to mitigate margin compression such action would be partially offset by increase in our liability related to policy with secondary guarantee in annuity the impact on adjusted earnings from margin compression is concentrated in our deferred annuity where there are minimum interest rate guarantee under the low interest rate scenario we assume that larger percentage of customer will maintain their fund with to take advantage of the attractive minimum guaranteed crediting rate and we expect to experience margin compression we reinvest cash flow at lower interest rate partially offsetting this margin compression we assume we will lower crediting rate on contractual reset date for the portion of business that is not currently at minimum crediting rate additionally we have various interest rate derivative position to partially mitigate this risk of contentslong term care and retained asset account are interest rate sensitive long term care reserve have exposure to lower reinvestment rate that can not be offset by reduction in liability crediting rate for established claim reserve long term care policy are guaranteed renewable and rate may be adjusted on class basis with regulatory approval to reflect emerging experience our long term care block is closed to new business we review the discount rate assumption and other assumption associated with our long term disability claim reserve no le frequently than annually and with respect to interest rate we set the discount rate on these reserve based on the prevailing interest rate environment at the time our retained asset account have minimum interest crediting rate guarantee which range from to all of which are currently at their respective minimum interest crediting rate while we expect to experience margin compression we reinvest at lower rate the interest rate derivative held in this portfolio should partially mitigate this risk reinvestment risk is defined for this purpose the amount of reinvestment in and that would impact adjusted earnings due to reinvesting cash flow in the low interest rate scenario for the life business billion billion and billion in and respectively of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of billion billion and billion in and respectively for our deferred annuity business billion billion and billion in and respectively of the asset base will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of billion billion and billion in and respectively for our long term care portfolio billion billion and billion of the asset base in and respectively will be subject to reinvestment risk on an average asset base of billion billion and billion in and respectively we estimate an unfavorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on the adjusted earnings of our metlife holding segment from the low interest rate scenario of million million and million in and respectively corporate othercorporate other contains the surplus portfolio for the enterprise the portfolio used to fund the capital need of the company and various reinsurance agreement the surplus portfolio are subject to reinvestment risk however lower net investment income is significantly offset by lower interest expense on both fixed and variable rate debt under lower interest rate environment fixed rate debt is assumed to be either paid off when it matures or refinanced at lower interest rate resulting in lower overall interest expense variable rate debt is indexed to the three month libor which result in lower interest expense incurred we estimate an unfavorable combined long term and short term interest rate impact on the adjusted earnings of corporate other from the low interest rate scenario of million million and million in and respectively competitive pressuresthe life insurance industry remains highly competitive see business competition product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product feature and service several of the industry product can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition cost reduction effort are priority for industry player with benefit resulting in price adjustment to favor customer and reinvestment capacity larger company have the ability to invest in brand equity product development technology optimization risk management and innovation which are among the fundamental for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry insurer are focused on their core business specifically in market where they can achieve scale insurer are increasingly seeking alternative source of revenue there is focus on monetization of asset fee based service and opportunity to offer comprehensive solution which include providing value added service along with traditional product financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisite for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry larger market participant tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics distribution and information technology and have the capability to engage with the new digital entrant there is shift in distribution from proprietary to third party model in mature market due to the lower cost structure evolving customer expectation are having significant impact on the competitive environment insurer strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base we believe that the continued volatility of the financial market and it impact on the capital position of many competitor will continue to strain the competitive environment legislative and other change affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial service industry see business regulation we believe that the aforementioned factor have highlighted financial strength technology efficiency and organizational agility the most significant differentiator and result we believe the company is well positioned to compete in this environment of contentsregulatory developmentsin the united state our life insurance company are regulated primarily at the state level with some product and service also subject to federal regulation life insurer introduce new and often more complex product regulator refine capital requirement and introduce new reserving

accounting requires the use of estimation technique in determining the estimated fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimate in applying these policy and estimate management make subjective and complex judgment that frequently require assumption about matter that are inherently uncertain many of these policy estimate and related judgment are common in the insurance and financial service industry others are specific to our business and operation actual result could differ from these estimate liability for future policy benefitsgenerally future policy benefit are payable over an extended period of time and related liability are calculated the present value of future expected benefit to be paid reduced by the present value of future expected premium such liability are established based on method and underlying assumption in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standard principal assumption used in the establishment of liability for future policy benefit are mortality morbidity policy lapse renewal retirement disability incidence disability termination investment return inflation expense and other contingent event appropriate to the respective product type and geographical area these assumption are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefit are payable utilizing these assumption liability are established on block of business basis if experience is le favorable than assumed additional liability may be established resulting in charge to policyholder benefit and claim future policy benefit liability for disabled life are estimated using the present value of benefit method and experience assumption to claim termination expense and interest of contentsliabilities for unpaid claim are estimated based upon our historical experience and other actuarial assumption that consider the effect of current development anticipated trend and risk management program reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation future policy benefit liability for minimum death and income benefit guarantee relating to certain annuity contract are based on estimate of the expected value of benefit in excess of the projected account balance recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessment liability for ulsg and paid up guarantee are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefit payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefit ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessment the assumption used in estimating the secondary and paid up guarantee liability are consistent with those used for amortizing dac and are thus subject to the same variability and risk the assumption of investment performance and volatility for variable product are consistent with historical experience of the appropriate underlying equity index such the index we regularly review our estimate of liability for future policy benefit and compare them with our actual experience difference between actual experience and the assumption used in pricing these policy and guarantee well in the establishment of the related liability result in variance in profit and could result in loss see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our liability for future policy benefit reinsuranceaccounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumption and estimate particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risk we periodically review actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumption used to establish asset and liability relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluate the financial strength of counterparties to our reinsurance agreement using criterion similar to that evaluated in our security impairment process see investment impairment additionally for each of our reinsurance agreement we determine whether the agreement provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk in accordance with applicable accounting standard we review all contractual feature including those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or feature that delay the timely reimbursement of claim if we determine that reinsurance agreement doe not expose the reinsurer to reasonable possibility of significant loss from insurance risk we record the agreement using the deposit method of accounting see note of the note to the consolidated financial

certain acquired block of business the estimated fair value of the in force contract obligation exceeded the book value of assumed in force insurance policy liability resulting in negative voba which is presented separately from voba an additional insurance liability included in other policy related balance the estimated fair value of the acquired obligation is based on projection by each block of business of future policy and contract charge premium mortality and morbidity separate account performance surrender expense investment return nonperformance risk adjustment and other factor actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projection the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business of contentsseparate account rate of return on variable universal life contract and variable deferred annuity contract affect in force account balance on such contract each reporting period which can result in significant fluctuation in amortization of dac and voba our practice to determine the impact of gross profit resulting from return on separate account assumes that long term appreciation in equity market is not changed by short term market fluctuation but is only changed when sustained interim deviation are expected we monitor these event and only change the assumption when our long term expectation change the effect of an increase decrease by basis point in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in decrease increase in the dac and voba amortization with an offset to our unearned revenue liability which net to approximately million we use mean reversion approach to separate account return where the mean reversion period is five year with long term separate account return after the five year reversion period is over the current long term rate of return assumption for the variable universal life contract and variable deferred annuity contract is we periodically review long term assumption underlying the projection of estimated gross margin and profit these assumption primarily relate to investment return policyholder dividend scale interest crediting rate mortality persistency and expense to administer business assumption used in the calculation of estimated gross margin and profit which may have significantly changed are updated annually if the update of assumption cause expected future gross margin and profit to increase dac and voba amortization will decrease resulting in current period increase to earnings the opposite result occurs when the assumption update cause expected future gross margin and profit to decrease our most significant assumption update resulting in change to expected future gross margin and profit and the amortization of dac and voba are due to revision to expected future investment return expense in force or persistency assumption and policyholder dividend on participating traditional life contract variable and universal life contract and annuity contract we expect these assumption to be the one most reasonably likely to cause significant change in the future change in these assumption can be offsetting and

estimated fair value of certain investment investment impairmentsone of the significant estimate related to fixed maturity security available for sale afs is our impairment evaluation the assessment of whether an other than temporary impairment otti occurred is based on our case by case evaluation of the underlying reason for the decline in estimated fair value on security by security basis our review of each security for otti includes an analysis of gross unrealized loss by three category of severity and or age of gross unrealized loss an extended and severe unrealized loss position on security may not have any impact on the ability of the issuer to service all scheduled interest and principal payment accordingly such an unrealized loss position may not impact our evaluation of recoverability of all contractual cash flow or the ability to recover an amount at least equal to it amortized cost based on the present value of the expected future cash flow to be collected additionally we consider wide range of factor about the security issuer and use our best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospect for near term recovery inherent in our evaluation of the security are assumption and estimate about the operation of the issuer and it future earnings potential factor we consider in the otti evaluation process are described in note of the note to the consolidated financial statement the determination of the amount of allowance and impairment on the remaining invested asset class is highly subjective and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risk associated with the respective asset class such evaluation and assessment are revised condition change and new information becomes available see note and of the note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information relating to our determination of the amount of allowance and impairment derivativesthe determination of the estimated fair value of freestanding derivative when quoted market value are not available is based on market standard valuation methodology and input that management belief are consistent with what other market participant would use when pricing the instrument derivative valuation can be affected by change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate financial index credit spread default risk nonperformance risk volatility liquidity and change in estimate and assumption used in the pricing model see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on significant input into the otc derivative pricing model and credit risk adjustment of contentswe issue variable annuity product with guaranteed minimum benefit some of which are embedded derivative measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity product with change in estimated fair value reported in net derivative gain loss the estimated fair value of these embedded derivative are determined based on the present value of projected future benefit minus the present value of projected future fee the projection of future benefit and future fee require capital market and actuarial assumption including expectation concerning policyholder behavior risk neutral valuation methodology is used under which the cash flow from the guarantee are projected under multiple capital market scenario using observable risk free rate the valuation of these embedded derivative also includes an adjustment for our nonperformance risk and risk margin for non capital market input the nonperformance risk adjustment which is captured spread over the risk free rate in determining the discount rate to discount the cash flow of the liability is determined by taking into consideration publicly available information relating to spread in the secondary market for metlife inc debt including related credit default swap these observable spread are then adjusted necessary to reflect the priority of these liability and the claim paying ability of the issuing insurance subsidiary compared to metlife inc risk margin are established to capture the non capital market risk of the instrument which represent the additional compensation market participant would require to assume the risk related to the uncertainty in certain actuarial assumption the establishment of risk margin requires the use of significant management judgment including assumption of the amount and cost of capital needed to cover the guarantee the table below illustrates the impact that range of reasonably likely variance in credit spread would have on our consolidated balance sheet excluding the effect of income tax related to the embedded derivative valuation on certain variable annuity product measured at estimated fair value in determining the range we have considered current market condition well the market level of spread that can reasonably be anticipated over the near term the range do not reflect extreme market condition such those experienced during the financial crisis we do not consider those to be reasonably likely event in the near future the impact of the range of reasonably likely variance in credit spread increased significantly compared to prior period however these estimated effect do not take into account potential change in other variable such equity price level and market volatility which can also contribute significantly to change in carrying value therefore the table doe not necessarily reflect the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statement under the credit spread variance scenario presented below change in balance sheet carrying value at december policyholder account balance dac and voba in million increase in our credit spread reported decrease in our credit spread accounting for derivative is complex and interpretation of accounting standard continue to evolve in practice if it is determined that hedge accounting designation were not appropriately applied reported net income could be materially affected assessment of hedge effectiveness and measurement of ineffectiveness of hedging relationship are also subject to interpretation and estimation and different interpretation or estimate may have material effect on the amount reported in net income variable annuity with guaranteed minimum benefit may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity market market condition including but not limited to change in interest rate equity index market volatility and foreign currency exchange rate change in our nonperformance risk variation in actuarial assumption regarding policyholder behavior mortality and risk margin related to non capital market input may result in significant fluctuation in the estimated fair value of the guarantee that could materially affect net income if interpretation change there is risk that feature previously not bifurcated may require bifurcation and reporting at estimated fair value on the consolidated financial statement and respective change in estimated fair value could materially affect net income of contentsadditionally we ceded the risk associated with certain of the variable annuity with guaranteed minimum benefit described in the preceding paragraph the value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is determined using methodology consistent with that described previously for the guarantee directly written by with the exception of the input for nonperformance risk that reflects the credit of the reinsurer because certain of the direct guarantee do not meet the definition of an embedded derivative and thus are not accounted for at fair value significant fluctuation in net income may occur since the change in fair value of the embedded derivative on the ceded risk is being recorded in net income without corresponding and offsetting change in fair value of the direct guarantee see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative and hedging program goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if event or circumstance such adverse change in the business climate indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test for purpose of goodwill impairment testing if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss if any in such instance the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner the amount of goodwill that would be determined in business acquisition the key input judgment and assumption necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting unit include projected adjusted earnings current book value the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business long term growth rate comparative market multiple the account value of in force business projection of new and renewed business well margin on such business the level of interest rate credit spread equity market level and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit in the third quarter of the company tested the metlife holding life reporting unit for impairment using the actuarial based embedded value fair valuation approach the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately and therefore the reporting unit wa not impaired if we had assumed that the discount rate wa basis point higher than the discount rate used the estimated fair value of the metlife holding life reporting unit would have been higher than the carrying value by approximately the metlife holding life reporting unit consists of operation relating to product and business no longer actively marketed by the company of december the amount of goodwill allocated to the metlife holding life reporting unit wa million the company also performed it annual goodwill impairment test of all other reporting unit during the third quarter of using qualitative assessment and or quantitative assessment under the market multiple and discounted cash flow valuation approach based on best available data of june and concluded that the estimated fair value of all such reporting unit were substantially in excess of their carrying value and therefore goodwill wa not impaired we apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting unit the valuation methodology utilized are subject to key judgment and assumption that are sensitive to change estimate of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management reasonable expectation regarding future development these estimate and the judgment and assumption upon which the estimate are based will in all likelihood differ in some respect from actual future result

primarily related to tax reform management of investment portfolio and hedging market risk with derivative we manage our investment portfolio using disciplined alm principle focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liability our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflow with invested asset that have cash inflow of comparable timing and amount while optimizing risk adjusted net investment income and risk adjusted total return our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investment with over of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity security afs and mortgage loan these security and loan have varying maturity and other characteristic which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and

linked investment which can vary significantly from period to period include change in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by corresponding

foreign currency exchange rate credit spread and equity market counterparty specific factor such financial performance credit rating and collateral valuation and internal factor such portfolio rebalancing change in these factor from period to period can significantly impact the level of both impairment and realized gain and loss on investment sold we also use derivative an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liability to hedge certain risk including change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate credit spread and equity market level we use freestanding interest rate equity credit and currency derivative to hedge certain invested asset and insurance liability portion of these hedge are designated and qualify accounting hedge which reduce volatility in earnings for those hedge not designated accounting hedge change in market factor lead to the recognition of fair value change in net derivative gain loss generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged which creates volatility in earnings we actively evaluate market risk hedging need and strategy to ensure our free cash flow and capital objective are met under range of market condition for example during we restructured certain derivative hedge to decrease volatility from nonqualified interest rate derivative and to help meet prospective dividend and free cash flow objective under varying interest rate scenario part of this restructuring we replaced certain nonqualified derivative with derivative that qualify for hedge accounting treatment in addition we also entered into replication transaction using interest rate swap which are accounted for at amortized cost under statutory guideline and are nonqualified derivative under gaap certain variable annuity product with guaranteed minimum benefit contain embedded derivative that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract with change in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gain loss we use freestanding derivative to hedge the market risk inherent in these variable annuity guarantee ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to take advantage of recently adopted naic rule related to statutory accounting election for derivative that mitigate interest rate sensitivity related to

derivative for example the index decreased in and increased in long term interest rate increased in and mostly decreased in contributing to favorable change in our embedded derivative our freestanding interest rate derivative were favorably impacted by the restructuring of the va hedging strategy partially offset by the increase in interest rate for example the year swap rate increased basis point in and decreased basis point in change in foreign currency exchange rate contributed to favorable change in our freestanding derivative and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivative related to the assumed variable annuity guarantee from our former operating joint venture in japan for example the japanese yen strengthened against the euro by in and weakened by in the aforementioned million million net of income tax unfavorable change in other risk in embedded derivative reflects actuarial assumption update associated with variable annuity guarantee assumed from our former operating joint venture in japan update to actuarial policyholder behavior assumption within the valuation model and combination of other factor which include fee being deducted from account change in the benefit base premium lapse withdrawal and death the aforementioned million million net of income tax favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivative resulted from favorable change of million before income tax result of model change and change in capital market input such long term interest rate and key equity index level on variable annuity guarantee in addition to favorable change of million before income tax related to change in our own credit spread when equity index level decrease in isolation the variable annuity guarantee become more valuable to policyholder which result in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yield smaller loss than by discounting at the risk free rate thus creating gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk when the risk free interest rate decrease in isolation discounting the embedded derivative liability produce higher valuation of the liability than if the risk free interest rate had remained constant discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yield smaller loss than by discounting at the risk free interest rate thus creating gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk when our own credit spread increase in isolation discounting the embedded derivative liability produce lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant result gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk for each of these primary market driver the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction net investment gain loss the favorable change in net investment gain loss of million million net of income tax primarily reflects lower non investment portfolio loss in in we recognized mark to market loss on our retained investment in brighthouse financial inc in connection with the separation in we recognized lower loss

with the revised methodology for these structured security wa to increase the accuracy in assessing expected loss and to use the improved assessment to determine more appropriate capital requirement for such structured security the revised methodology reduce regulatory reliance on rating agency and allow for greater regulatory input into the assumption used to estimate expected loss from structured security we apply the revised naic methodology to structured security held by metlife inc insurance subsidiary that maintain the naic statutory basis of accounting the naic present methodology is to evaluate structured security held by insurer using the revised naic methodology on an annual basis if metlife inc insurance subsidiary acquire structured security that have not been previously evaluated by the naic but are expected to be evaluated by the naic in the upcoming annual review an internally developed designation is used until naic designation becomes available naic

expected policy assessment based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefit generated using multiple scenario of separate account return the scenario are based on best estimate assumption consistent with those used to amortize dac when current estimate of future benefit exceed those previously projected or when current estimate of future assessment are lower than those previously projected liability will increase resulting in current period charge to net income the opposite result occurs when the current estimate of future benefit are lower than those previously projected or when

methodology is used to project the cash flow from the guarantee under multiple capital market scenario to determine an economic liability the reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking

correspond to revenue under gaap but are used relevant measure of business activity further sale statistic for our latin america asia and emea segment are on constant currency basis near term represents one to three year asymmetrical and non economic accounting refers to the portion of net derivative gain loss on embedded derivative attributable to the inclusion of our credit spread in the

exchange rate stress scenario payoff liquidity foreign exchange asset sector concentration and credit quality market risk exposureswe regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market price risk result of that analysis we have determined that the estimated fair value of certain asset and liability are materially exposed to change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market we have exposure to market risk through our insurance operation and investment activity for purpose of this disclosure market risk is defined the risk of loss resulting from change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market interest ratesour exposure to interest rate change result most significantly from our holding of fixed maturity security well our interest rate sensitive liability the fixed maturity security afs include and foreign government bond security issued by government agency corporate bond mortgage backed security and ab all of which are mainly exposed to change in medium and long term interest rate the interest rate sensitive liability for purpose of this disclosure include debt policyholder account

liability well through our investment in foreign subsidiary the foreign currency exchange rate liability for purpose of this disclosure exclude significant portion of the liability relating to insurance contract the principal currency that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in our investment portfolio and liability are the euro the japanese yen and the british pound selectively we use dollar asset to support certain long duration foreign currency liability through our investment in foreign subsidiary and joint venture we are primarily exposed to the japanese yen the euro the australian dollar the british pound the mexican peso the chilean peso and the korean won in addition to hedging with foreign currency swap forward and option local surplus in some country may be held entirely or in part in dollar asset which further minimize exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk we have matched much of our foreign currency liability in our foreign subsidiary with their respective foreign currency asset thereby reducing our risk to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation see risk factor economic environment and capital market risk difficult economic condition may adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition equity marketalong with investment in equity security we have exposure to equity market risk through certain liability that involve long term guarantee on equity performance such embedded derivative on variable annuity with guaranteed minimum benefit and certain policyholder account balance equity exposure associated with limited partnership interest are excluded from this discussion they are not considered financial instrument under gaap management of market risk exposureswe use variety of strategy to manage interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk including the use of derivative interest rate risk managementto manage interest rate risk we analyze interest rate risk using various model including multi scenario cash flow projection model that forecast cash flow of the liability and their supporting investment including derivative these projection involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of our in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environment the nydfs regulation require that we perform some of these analysis annually part of our review of the sufficiency of our regulatory reserve for several of our legal entity we maintain segmented operating and surplus asset portfolio for the purpose of alm and the allocation of investment income to product line in the for each segment invested asset greater than or equal to the gaap liability net of certain non invested asset allocated to the segment are maintained with any excess allocated to corporate other the business segment may reflect difference in legal entity statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive distinct investment strategy with respect to duration liquidity or credit quality of the invested asset certain smaller entity make use of unsegmented general account for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristic of liability in those entity we measure relative sensitivity of the value of our asset and liability to change in key assumption utilizing internal model these model reflect specific product characteristic and include assumption based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse mortality and interest crediting rate in addition these model include asset cash flow projection reflecting interest payment sinking fund payment principal payment bond call mortgage loan prepayment and default we employ product design pricing and alm strategy to reduce the potential effect of interest rate movement product design and pricing strategy include the use of surrender charge or restriction on withdrawal in some product and the ability to reset crediting rate for certain product alm strategy include the use of derivative we also use reinsurance to mitigate interest rate risk we also use common industry metric such duration and convexity to measure the relative sensitivity of asset and liability value to change in interest rate in computing the duration of liability we consider all policyholder guarantee and how we intend to set indeterminate policy element such interest credit or dividend each asset portfolio or portfolio group ha duration target based on the liability duration and the investment objective of that portfolio where liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available asset we may support such liability with equity investment derivative or interest rate curve mismatch strategy of contentsforeign currency exchange rate risk managementmetlife ha well established enterprise foreign exchange fx risk policy to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposure within it risk tolerance in general investment backing specific liability are currency matched this is achieved through direct investment in matching currency or through the use of fx derivative enterprise fx risk limit are established by the erc management of each of our segment with oversight from our fx risk committee and the respective alm committee for the segment is responsible for managing any foreign currency exchange rate exposure we use foreign currency swap forward and option to mitigate the liability exposure risk of loss and financial statement volatility associated with our investment in foreign subsidiary foreign currency denominated fixed income investment and the sale of certain insurance product equity market risk managementwe manage equity market risk on an integrated basis with other risk through our alm strategy including the dynamic hedging of certain variable annuity guarantee benefit well reinsurance in order to limit loss minimize exposure to large risk and provide additional capacity for future growth we also manage equity market risk exposure in our investment portfolio through the use of derivative these derivative include exchange traded equity future equity index option contract total rate of return swap and equity variance swap this risk is managed by our alm unit in partnership with the investment department hedging activitieswe use derivative contract primarily to hedge wide range of risk including interest rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk and equity market risk derivative hedge are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while considering their impact on financial result under different accounting regime including gaap and local statutory accounting our derivative hedge program vary depending on the type of risk being hedged some hedge program are asset or liability specific while others are portfolio hedge that reduce risk related to group of liability or asset our use of derivative by major hedge program is follows risk related to guarantee benefit we use wide range of derivative contract to mitigate the risk associated with living guarantee benefit these derivative include equity and interest rate future interest rate swap currency future forward equity indexed option total rate of return swap interest rate option contract and equity variance swap minimum interest rate guarantee for certain liability contract we provide the contractholder guaranteed minimum interest rate these contract include certain fixed annuity and other insurance liability we purchase interest rate cap and floor to reduce risk associated with these liability guarantee reinvestment risk in long duration liability contract derivative are used to hedge interest rate risk related to certain long duration liability contract hedge include interest rate swap and swaptions foreign currency exchange rate risk we use currency swap forward and option to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk these hedge are generally used to swap foreign currency denominated bond investment in foreign subsidiary or equity market exposure to dollar our foreign subsidiary also use these hedge to swap non local currency asset to local currency to match liability general alm hedging strategy in the ordinary course of managing our asset liability risk we use interest rate future interest rate swap interest rate cap and inflation swap these hedge are designed to reduce interest rate risk or inflation risk related to the existing asset or liability or related to expected future cash flow of contentsrisk measurement sensitivity analysiswe measure market risk related to our market sensitive asset and liability based on change in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market price utilizing sensitivity analysis for purpose of this disclosure significant portion of the liability relating to insurance contract is excluded discussed further below this analysis estimate the potential change in estimated fair value based on hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market price we believe that change increase or decrease in these market rate and price is reasonably possible in the near term in performing the analysis summarized below we used market rate at december the sensitivity analysis separately calculates each of our market risk exposure interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market relating to our asset and liability we modeled the impact of change in market rate and price on the estimated fair value of our market sensitive asset and liability follows the net present value of our interest rate sensitive exposure resulting from change increase or decrease in interest rate the dollar equivalent estimated fair value of our foreign currency exposure due to change increase in the value of the dollar compared to all foreign currency or decrease in the value of the dollar compared to all foreign currency in foreign currency exchange rate and the estimated fair value of our equity position due to change increase or decrease in equity market price the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed predictive of our future financial performance we can not ensure that our actual loss in any particular period will not exceed the amount indicated in the table below limitation related to this sensitivity analysis include interest sensitive and foreign currency exchange sensitive liability do not include billion at carrying value of insurance contract management belief that the change in the economic value of those contract under changing interest rate and changing foreign currency exchange rate would offset significant portion of the fair value change of interest sensitive and foreign currency exchange rate sensitive asset the market risk information is limited by the assumption and parameter established in creating the related sensitivity analysis including the impact of prepayment rate on mortgage loan sensitivity do not include the impact on asset or liability valuation of change in market liquidity or change in market credit spread foreign currency risk is not isolated for certain embedded derivative within host asset and liability contract the risk on these instrument is reflected equity for the derivative that qualify hedge and for certain other asset such mortgage loan the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market value the analysis excludes liability pursuant to insurance contract and real estate holding and the model assumes that the composition of asset and liability remains unchanged throughout the period accordingly we use such model tool and not substitute for the experience and judgment of our management based on our analysis of the impact of change increase or decrease in market rate and price we have determined that such change could have material adverse effect on the estimated fair value of certain asset and liability from interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and equity market exposure the table below illustrates the potential loss in estimated fair value for each market risk exposure of our market

market price common evaluation framework is used for establishing non specific valuation allowance for all loan portfolio segment however separate non specific valuation allowance is calculated and maintained for each loan portfolio segment that is based on input unique to each loan portfolio segment non specific valuation allowance are established for pool of loan with similar risk characteristic where property specific or market specific risk ha not been identified but for which the company expects to incur credit loss these evaluation are based upon several loan portfolio segment specific factor including the company experience with loan loss default and loss severity and loss expectation for loan with similar risk characteristic these evaluation are revised condition change and new information becomes available commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolio segmentsthe company typically us several year of historical experience in establishing non specific

higher risk loan including review on geographic and property type basis higher risk loan are reviewed individually on an ongoing basis for potential credit loss and specific valuation allowance are established using the methodology described above quarterly the remaining loan are reviewed on pool basis by aggregating group of loan that have similar risk characteristic for potential credit loss and non specific valuation allowance are established described above using input that are unique to each segment of the loan portfolio for commercial mortgage loan the primary credit quality indicator is the debt service coverage ratio which compare property net operating income to amount needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan generally the lower the debt service coverage ratio the higher the risk of experiencing credit loss the company also review the loan to value ratio of it commercial mortgage loan portfolio loan to value ratio compare the unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral generally the higher the loan to value ratio the higher the risk of experiencing credit loss the debt service coverage ratio and
