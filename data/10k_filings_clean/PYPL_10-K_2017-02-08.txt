account and nominal fee when consumer fund payment transaction from an existing paypal account balance or through our paypal credit product our financial success is sensitive to change in the rate at which our consumer fund payment using credit and debit card collectively payment card which can significantly increase our cost while we provide consumer with the opportunity to use their existing paypal account balance to fund payment transaction some of our consumer may prefer to use payment card especially if these payment card offer functionality and benefit not associated with the use of their bank account some of our offering including the ability of consumer to make limited number of guest payment without opening paypal account have higher rate of payment card funding than our basic product offering an increase in the portion of our payment volume funded using payment card or in fee associated with our funding mix or other event or development that make it more difficult or costly for to fund transaction by electronic transfer of fund from bank account or existing paypal account balance could materially and adversely affect our financial performance and significantly harm our business some of of contentsour plan to lower our funding cost including our paypal credit product and enabling consumer to defer payment for short period of time on some transaction may increase the risk to of nonpayment by consumer negotiated arrangement with payment card network and or issuing bank promoting greater choice and option for consumer to fund payment transaction could have an uncertain impact on our business we have entered into strategic partnership with partner such visa inc visa mastercard international incorporated mastercard and dfs service llc discover to make it easier for merchant to accept and consumer to pay with these partner credit and or debt card and allow to gain access to these partner tokenization service for in store point of sale paypal transaction while we anticipate these and similar strategic partnership we may enter in the future will result in an increase in the number of transaction and transaction volume that we process we also anticipate that greater percentage of customer transaction will be executed using credit or debit card which would likely increase our funding cost if our transaction volume doe not increase expected our business and result of operation could be adversely affected due to increased cost associated with our funding mix our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breach our business involves the collection storage processing and transmission of customer personal data including financial information in addition significant number of our customer authorize to bill their payment card or bank account directly for all transaction and other fee charged by we have built our reputation on the premise that our payment platform offer customer secure way to make payment an increasing number of organization including large merchant and business other large technology company financial institution and government institution have disclosed breach of their information security system some of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attack including on portion of their website or infrastructure the technique used to obtain unauthorized improper or illegal access to our system our data or customer data disable or degrade service or sabotage system are constantly evolving may be difficult to detect quickly and often are not recognized launched against target unauthorized party may attempt to gain access to our system or facility through various mean including among others hacking into our system or facility or those of our customer partner or vendor or attempting to fraudulently induce our employee customer partner vendor or other user of our system into disclosing user name password payment card information or other sensitive information which may in turn be used to access our information technology system certain effort may be state sponsored and supported by significant financial and technological resource making them even more sophisticated and difficult to detect we believe that paypal is particularly attractive target for such breach and attack due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our product and service although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect our data and customer data and to prevent data loss and other security breach and expect to continue to expend significant additional resource to bolster these protection these security measure can not provide absolute security our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to cyberattacks or security breach and third party may be able to access our customer personal or proprietary information and payment card data that are stored on or accessible through those system our security measure may also be breached due to human error malfeasance system error or vulnerability or other irregularity any actual or perceived breach of our security could interrupt our operation result in our system or service being unavailable result in improper disclosure of data materially harm our reputation and brand result in significant legal and financial exposure lead to loss of customer confidence in or decreased use of our product and service and adversely affect our business and result of operation in addition any breach of network or data security at our customer partner or vendor including data center and cloud computing provider could have similar negative effect actual or perceived vulnerability or data breach may lead to claim against in addition under payment card rule and our contract with our card processor if there is breach of payment card information that we store or that is stored by our direct payment card processing customer we could be liable to the payment card issuing bank for their cost of issuing new card and related expense we also expect to expend significant additional resource to protect against security or privacy breach and may be required to redress problem caused by breach among other reason financial service regulator in various jurisdiction including the and the european union eu have implemented or are considering proposal to impose new authentication requirement on bank and payment processor intended to reduce online fraud which could impose significant cost require to change our business practice make it more difficult for new customer to join paypal and reduce the ease of use of our product which could harm our business additionally while we maintain insurance policy they may not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach and we may not be able to collect fully if at all under these insurance policy of contentssystems failure and resulting interruption in the availability of our website application product or service could harm our business our system and those of our service provider and partner may experience service interruption or degradation of hardware and software defect or malfunction computer denial of service and other cyberattacks human error earthquake hurricane flood fire natural disaster power loss disruption in telecommunication service fraud military or political conflict terrorist attack computer virus or other malware or other event our system also may be subject to break in sabotage and intentional act of vandalism some of our system are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality in addition provider of payment solution we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulator that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plan and more rigorous testing of such plan which may be costly and time consuming and may divert our resource from other business priority we have experienced and expect to continue to experience system failure denial of service attack and other event or condition from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our product and service these event have resulted and likely will result in loss of revenue prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability speed or other functionality of our product and service could materially harm our business frequent or persistent interruption in our service could cause current or potential customer to believe that our system are unreliable leading them to switch to our competitor or to avoid our product and service and could permanently harm our reputation and brand moreover to the extent that any system failure or similar event result in damage to our customer or their business partner these customer or partner could seek significant compensation or contractual penalty from for their loss and those claim even if unsuccessful would likely be time consuming and costly for to address and could have other consequence described in this risk factor section under the caption our business is subject to cyberattacks and security and privacy breach our payment platform ha experienced significant intermittent unavailability reliability is particularly critical for because the full time availability of our product and service is critical to our goal of gaining widespread acceptance among consumer and merchant for digital payment we have undertaken certain system upgrade and platforming effort designed to improve our reliability and speed these effort are costly and time consuming involve significant technical risk and may divert our resource from new feature and product and there can be no guarantee that these effort will succeed because we are regulated financial institution in certain jurisdiction frequent or persistent site interruption could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fine and penalty and mandatory and costly change to our business practice and ultimately could cause to lose existing license that we need to operate or prevent or delay from obtaining additional license that we need to expand our business we also rely on facility component and service supplied by third party including data center facility and cloud storage service if these third party cease to provide the facility component or service experience operational interference or disruption breach their agreement with or fail to meet our expectation our operation could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction damage to our reputation and brand and materially and adversely affect our business we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for all loss that may result from interruption in our service result of system failure and similar event change to payment card network or bank fee rule or practice could harm our business we do not directly access the payment card network such visa and mastercard that enable our acceptance of credit card and debit card including some type of prepaid card accordingly we must rely on bank or other payment processor to process transaction and must pay fee for the service from time to time payment card network have increased and may increase in the future the interchange fee and assessment that they charge for each transaction which access their network payment card network have or may impose special assessment for transaction that are executed through digital wallet such paypal and such fee could particularly impact and significantly increase our cost our payment card processor may have the right to pas any increase in interchange fee and assessment on to well increase their own fee for processing any change in interchange fee and assessment could increase our operating cost and reduce our operating income we have entered into strategic partnership with visa and mastercard to further expand our relationship with these network in way that will make it easier for merchant to accept and consumer to choose to pay with visa and mastercard credit and debit card during the term of the agreement visa and mastercard have each agreed to not enact or impose any fee or rule solely targeted at paypal upon termination of the agreement paypal could become subject to special digital wallet fee or other special assessment in addition in some jurisdiction government have required visa and mastercard to reduce interchange fee or have opened investigation to whether visa or mastercard interchange fee and practice violate antitrust law in the the federal reserve board issued final rule capping debit card interchange fee at significantly lower rate than visa or mastercard previously charged in the eu the multilateral interchange fee regulation limit credit and debit interchange fee for payment and imposes business rule on card processing service any material change in credit or debit card interchange rate in the or other market of contentsincluding result of change in interchange fee limitation could adversely affect our competitive position against traditional credit and debit card service provider future change to those regulation could potentially have an adverse effect on our business we are required by our processor to comply with payment card network operating rule including special operating rule for payment service provider to merchant and we have agreed to reimburse our processor for any fine they are assessed by payment card network result of any rule violation by or our merchant the payment card network set and interpret the card operating rule from time to time the network have alleged that various aspect of our business model violate these operating rule if such allegation are not resolved favorably they may result in material fine and penalty or require change in our business practice that may be costly the payment card network could adopt new operating rule or interpret or re interpret existing rule that we or our processor might find difficult or even impossible to follow or costly to implement result we could lose our ability to give consumer the option of using payment card to fund their payment or the choice of currency in which they would like their payment card to be charged if we are unable to accept payment card or are meaningfully limited in our ability to do so our business would be adversely affected we and our payment card processor have implemented specific business process for merchant to comply with payment card network operating rule for providing service to merchant any failure to comply with these rule could result in fine we are also subject to fine from payment card network if we fail to detect that merchant are engaging in activity that are illegal or that are considered high risk primarily the sale of certain type of digital content for high risk merchant we must either prevent such merchant from using our paypal service or register such merchant with the payment card network and conduct additional monitoring with respect to such merchant although the amount of these fine ha not been material to date additional fine in the future could become material and could result in termination of our ability to accept payment card or require change in our process for registering new customer which would materially harm our business payment card network rule may also increase the cost of impose restriction on or otherwise negatively impact the development of our retail point of sale solution which may negatively impact their deployment and adoption failure to deal effectively with fraud fictitious transaction bad transaction and negative customer experience would increase our loss rate and harm our business and could severely diminish merchant and consumer confidence in and use of our service we incur substantial loss due to claim from consumer that merchant have not performed or that their good or service do not match the merchant description we seek to recover such loss from the merchant but may not be able to recover in full if the merchant is unwilling or unable to pay in addition in the event of the bankruptcy or other business interruption of merchant that sell good or service in advance of the date of their delivery or use airline cruise or concert ticket custom made good and subscription we could be liable to the buyer of such good or service either through our buyer protection program or through chargebacks on payment card used by customer to fund their payment while we have established reserve based on assumption and estimate that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventuality these reserve may be insufficient we also incur substantial loss from claim that the consumer not authorize the purchase from consumer fraud from erroneous transmission and from customer who have closed bank account or have insufficient fund in them to satisfy payment in addition if loss incurred by related to payment card transaction become excessive they could potentially result in our losing the right to accept payment card for payment which would harm our business we have taken measure to detect and reduce the risk of fraud but these measure need to be continually improved and may not be effective against new and continually evolving form of fraud or in connection with new product offering if these measure do not succeed our business could be harmed we are exposed to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate we have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency risk the strengthening or weakening of the dollar versus the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar impact the translation of our net revenue generated in these foreign currency into the dollar additionally in connection with providing our service in multiple currency we generally set our foreign exchange rate twice per day we may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign exchange rate or result of fluctuation in foreign exchange rate between the time that we set them given that we also hold some corporate and customer fund in non currency our financial result are affected by the translation of these non currency into dollar we also have foreign exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary while we regularly enter into transaction to hedge portion of our foreign currency translation and balance sheet exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate the effect of this exposure fluctuation in foreign exchange rate could significantly impact our financial result of contentsany factor that reduce cross border trade or make such trade more difficult could harm our business cross border trade transaction where the merchant or consumer are in different country is an important source of our revenue and profit cross border transaction generally provide higher revenue and operating income than similar transaction that take place within single country or market cross border trade also represents our primary and in some case our only presence in certain important market cross border trade is subject to and may be impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuation in addition the potential interpretation and application of law of multiple jurisdiction the jurisdiction of the merchant and of the consumer are often extremely complicated in the context of cross border trade change to or the interpretation and or application of law applicable to cross border trade could impose additional requirement which may impose conflicting obligation and restriction on cross border trade and increase the cost associated with cross border trade any factor that increase the cost of cross border trade or restrict delay or make cross border trade more difficult or impractical would lower our revenue and profit and could harm our business the united kingdom departure from the eu could adversely affect the united kingdom held referendum on june in which majority of voter approved an exit from the eu brexit negotiation are expected to commence to determine the future term of the relationship with the eu including among other thing the term of trade between the and the eu the effect of brexit will depend on any agreement the reach to retain access to eu market either during transitional period or more permanently the outcome of this referendum caused volatility in global stock market and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation and uncertainty about the term and impact of brexit may continue to do so in the future brexit could adversely affect regional including european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange market including volatility in the value of the british pound and euro which in turn could adversely affect our customer and company with which we do business particularly in the in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national law and regulation the determines which eu law to replace or replicate in particular depending on the term of brexit we may face new regulatory cost and challenge including the following we could lose our ability for our eu operation to passport into the market through the banking license of paypal europe et cie sca paypal europe our wholly owned subsidiary that is licensed and subject to regulation bank in luxembourg and our

grow the business adversely affect our result of operation and harm our reputation the complexity of federal and state regulatory and enforcement regime coupled with the global scope of our operation and the evolving global regulatory environment could result in single event giving rise to large number of overlapping investigation and legal and regulatory proceeding by multiple government

market we allow customer in only approximately half of those market including the to also receive payment in some case with significant restriction on the manner in which customer can withdraw fund these limitation may affect our ability to grow our business in these market of the market whose resident can use our paypal service almost of them are in member state of the eu we provide our service

and we have been and continue to be required to make change to our compliance program in various jurisdiction in response regulator regularly re examine the transaction volume threshold at which we must obtain and keep applicable record or verify identity of customer and any change in such threshold could result in greater cost for compliance in the eu the implementation of the fourth anti money

increasing on global basis there is uncertainty associated with the legal and regulatory environment around privacy and data protection law which continue to develop in way we can not predict including with respect to evolving technology such cloud computing privacy and data protection law may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and impose inconsistent or conflicting requirement complying with varying jurisdictional requirement could increase the cost and complexity of compliance or require to change our business practice in manner adverse to our business and violation of privacy and data protection related law can result in significant penalty and damage to our brand and business in addition compliance with inconsistent privacy law may restrict our ability to provide product and service to our customer determination that there have been violation of privacy or data protection law could expose to significant damage award fine and other penalty that could individually or in the aggregate materially harm our business and reputation in october the european court of justice ruled that the eu safe harbor framework clause one

system paypal ha chosen to adopt eu model clause published by the european commission basis for the export of data from the eu to the for those part of our business that had previously relied on safe harbor in addition because paypal europe is headquartered in luxembourg and subject to regulation bank in that jurisdiction we have relied on the one stop shop concept under which luxembourg ha been our lead data protection regulator in the eu however recent european court of justice ruling weltimmo affecting company that do business in the eu potentially could make subject to the local data protection law or regulatory enforcement activity of the various eu member state in which we have established legal entity and which apply privacy law that are different than and which may even conflict with those in luxembourg in addition because of the large number of text message email phone call and other communication we send or make to our customer for various business purpose communication related privacy law that provide specified monetary damage award or fine for each violation could result in particularly significant damage award or fine for example under the telephone

data protection regime from the current national legislative approach to single european economic area privacy regulation the general data protection regulation gdpr which come into effect in the proposed eu data protection regime extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all foreign company processing data of eu resident it provides for harmonization of the data protection regulation

worldwide turnover and million and includes new right such the portability of personal data although the gdpr will apply across the eu without need for local implementing legislation ha been the case under the current data protection regime local data protection authority dpas will still have the ability to interpret the gdpr which ha the potential to create inconsistency on country by country

any termination or interruption of either bank ability to lend could result in the inability or unwillingness to originate any new paypal credit or paypal working capital loan in the event of either bank inability or unwillingness to lend we would either need to reach similar agreement with another chartered financial institution or obtain our own bank charter or license we may be unable to reach similar agreement with another partner on favorable term or at all and obtaining bank charter or lending license would be time consuming and costly process and would subject to additional law and regulatory requirement which could be burdensome and increase our cost in addition our commercial relationship with third party which are federally supervised financial institution could subject to examination by their federal banking regulator with respect to certain service that we provide in the second circuit court of appeal madden midland funding llc cir concluded that the buyer of charged credit card account could not rely on the national bank act preemption of state interest rate limit for interest at rate imposed by the buyer after charge off petition to the supreme court to review the decision wa denied in june and the case ha been remanded to the lower court to be determined in accordance with the ruling of the second circuit the decision ha resulted in some uncertainty to whether non bank entity purchasing loan originated by bank may rely on federal preemption of state usury law and may create an increased risk of litigation by plaintiff challenging our ability to collect interest and fee in accordance with the term of certain loan although the madden decision specifically addressed preemption under the national bank act this decision could support future challenge to federal preemption for other institution including fdic insured state chartered industrial bank like those that we rely on to issue our loan product in the although we believe the madden case can be distinguished from the manner in which we offer our credit product there can be no assurance to the outcome of any potential litigation or that the possible impact of such litigation will not have material adverse impact on our business our credit product expose to additional risk our paypal credit and paypal working capital product are offered to wide range of consumer and merchant and the financial success of these product depends on the effective management of the risk related to these product the lender for the paypal credit product extends credit using proprietary segmentation and credit algorithm and other analytical technique designed to analyze the credit risk of specific consumer based on their past purchasing and payment history with paypal well their credit score similarly to ass merchant who wish to obtain paypal working capital advance among other indicator the lender applies proprietary risk model to help predict the merchant ability to repay the working capital advance these risk model may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of consumer or merchant due to inaccurate assumption about the particular consumer or merchant or the economic environment or limited transaction history among other factor the accuracy of these risk model and the ability of the lender and our ability to manage credit risk related to our paypal credit and paypal working capital product may also be affected by legal or regulatory change competitor action change in consumer behavior change in the economic environment and other factor like other business with significant exposure to loss from consumer and merchant credit we face the risk that paypal credit and paypal working capital account holder will default on their payment obligation creating the risk of potential charge offs the non payment rate among account holder may increase due to among other thing change to underwriting standard worsening economic condition such recession or greater austerity in various country increase in prevailing interest rate and high unemployment rate account holder who miss payment often fail to repay their loan and account holder who file for protection under the bankruptcy law generally do not repay their loan we purchase receivables related to our paypal credit product and originated loan with respect to our paypal working capital

incur significant loss require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditure in order to resume operation change to our buyer and seller protection program could increase our loss rate our buyer and seller protection program protect merchant and consumer from fraudulent transaction in we increased the scope of our buyer protection program to cover digital good and intangible good and service in addition consumer who pay through paypal may have reimbursement right from their payment card issuer usually bank which in turn will seek recovery from the risk of loss from our buyer and seller protection program are specific to individual buyer seller and transaction and may also be impacted by regional variation to these program modification to these program resulting from change in regulatory requirement or change that we decide to implement such expanding the scope of transaction covered by one or more of these program upon paypal becoming an independent publicly traded company on july we extended our protection program in several country to cover certain customer purchase on ebay and our cost associated with these program have therefore increased increase in our loss rate including result of changing our buyer and seller protection program could harm our business our international operation are subject to increased risk which could harm our business our

inherent in our international operation and expansion may increase our cost of doing business internationally and could harm our business we are exposed to fluctuation in interest rate we are exposed to interest rate risk from our investment portfolio and from interest rate sensitive asset underlying the customer balance we hold on our balance sheet customer account low interest rate environment or reduction in interest rate may negatively impact our investment income and our net income in addition fluctuation in interest rate may adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to higher payment obligation by customer to and other lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income in july we entered into revolving credit facility result to the extent of our borrowing under the facility which bear interest at floating rate we will be exposed to interest rate fluctuation use of our payment service for illegal purpose could harm our business our payment system is susceptible to potentially illegal or improper us including money laundering terrorist

harm our business our failure to manage our customer fund and the asset underlying our customer fund properly could harm our business we hold substantial amount of fund belonging to our customer including deposit in customer account and fund being remitted to seller of good and service our ability to manage and account accurately for the asset underlying our customer fund requires high level of internal control our business continues to grow and we expand our product offering we must continue to strengthen our associated internal control for example in march approved by the supervisory board of paypal europe and permitted by the cssf certain european customer balance held in our luxembourg banking subsidiary are being used to extend credit to our european customer our success requires significant public confidence in our ability to properly manage our customer balance and handle large and growing transaction volume and amount of customer fund any failure to maintain the necessary control or to manage our customer fund and the asset underlying our customer fund accurately could result in reputational harm lead customer to discontinue or reduce their use of our product

various government agency under and foreign law and regulation including antitrust and competition law an increasing number of jurisdiction also provide private right of action for competitor or consumer to assert claim of anti competitive conduct other company and government agency have in the past and may in the future allege that our action violate the antitrust or competition law of the individual state other country or the european commission or otherwise constitute unfair competition an increasing number of government are regulating competition law activity including increased scrutiny in large market such china our business agreement or arrangement with customer or other company could give rise to regulatory action or antitrust litigation some regulator particularly those outside of the may perceive our business to be used so broadly that otherwise uncontroversial business practice could be deemed anticompetitive any claim or investigation even if without foundation may be very expensive to defend or respond to involve negative publicity of contentsand substantial diversion of management time and effort and could result in reputational harm significant judgment against or require to change our business practice we are subject to patent litigation we have repeatedly been sued for allegedly infringing other party patent at any given time we are typically defendant in number of patent lawsuit and have been notified of several other potential patent dispute we expect that we will increasingly be subject to patent infringement claim because among other reason our product and service continue to expand in scope and complexity we continue to expand into new business area including through acquisition and the number of patent owner who may claim that we any of the company that we have acquired or our customer infringe their patent and the aggregate number of patent controlled by such patent owner continues to increase such claim may be brought directly against or against our customer whom we may indemnify either because we are contractually obligated to do so or we choose to do so business matter we believe that an increasing number of these claim against and other technology company have been and continue to be initiated by third party whose sole or primary business is to assert such claim in addition we have seen significant patent dispute between operating company in some technology industry patent claim whether meritorious or not are time consuming and costly to defend and resolve and could require to make expensive change in our method of doing business enter into costly royalty or licensing agreement make substantial payment to satisfy adverse judgment or settle claim or proceeding or cease conducting certain operation which would harm our business we may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property right or third party may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property right the protection of our intellectual property including our trademark patent copyright domain name trade dress and trade secret is important to the success of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property right by relying on applicable law and regulation in the and internationally well variety of administrative procedure we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right when offering or procuring product and service including confidentiality and invention assignment agreement entered into with our employee and contractor and confidentiality agreement with party with whom we conduct business effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our product and service are made available we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our right although we have generally taken measure to protect our intellectual property right there can be no assurance that we will be successful in protecting or enforcing our right in every jurisdiction or that contractual arrangement and other step that we have taken to protect our intellectual property will prevent third party from infringing or misappropriating our intellectual property or deter independent development of equivalent or superior intellectual property right by others if we are unable to prevent third party from adopting registering or using trademark and trade dress that infringe dilute or otherwise violate our trademark right the value of our brand could be diminished and our business could be adversely affected also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary right we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to others these licensee may take action that diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation any failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property right or significant cost incurred in doing so could diminish the value of our intangible asset and materially harm our business the number of product in the technology and payment industry increase and the functionality of these product further overlap and we acquire technology through acquisition or license we may become increasingly subject to intellectual property infringement and other claim litigation may be necessary to determine the validity and scope of the patent and other intellectual property right of others the ultimate outcome of any allegation is often uncertain and regardless of the outcome any such claim with or without merit may be time consuming result in costly litigation divert management time and attention from our business and require to among other thing stop providing transaction processing and other payment related service or redesign stop selling our product or service pay substantial amount to satisfy judgment or settle claim or lawsuit pay substantial royalty or licensing fee or satisfy indemnification obligation that we have with certain party with whom we have

ongoing consumer protection and intellectual property litigation discussed above the number and significance of these dispute and inquiry have increased our company ha grown larger our business ha expanded in scope and geographic reach and our product and service have increased in complexity in addition the law rule and regulation affecting our business including those pertaining to internet and mobile commerce payment service and credit are subject to ongoing interpretation by the court and governmental authority and the resulting uncertainty in the scope and application of these law rule and regulation increase the risk that we will be subject to private claim and governmental action alleging violation of those law rule and regulation the scope outcome and impact of claim lawsuit government investigation and proceeding that we are subject to can not be predicted with certainty regardless of the outcome such investigation and proceeding can have an adverse impact on because of legal cost diversion of management resource reputational damage and other factor determining reserve for our pending litigation and regulatory proceeding is complex fact intensive process that is subject to management judgment resolving one or more such legal and regulatory proceeding could potentially require to make substantial payment to satisfy judgment fine or penalty or to settle claim or proceeding any of which could materially and adversely affect our business these proceeding could also result in reputational harm criminal sanction consent decree or order preventing from offering certain product or service requiring change in our business practice in costly way or development of non infringing or otherwise altered product or technology any of these consequence could materially and adversely affect our business certain of our customer agreement contain arbitration provision with class action waiver provision that may limit our exposure to consumer class action litigation but

or regulatory development may directly or indirectly prohibit or limit the use of pre dispute arbitration clause and class action waiver provision any such prohibition or limitation on or discontinuation of the use of such arbitration or class action waiver provision could subject to additional lawsuit including additional consumer class action litigation or materially impact our

the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amount recorded in our financial statement and may materially affect our financial result in the period for which such determination is made while we have established reserve based on assumption and estimate that we believe are reasonable to cover such eventuality these reserve may prove to be insufficient in addition our future income tax could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated or by the incurrence of loss in jurisdiction that have lower statutory tax rate and higher than anticipated in jurisdiction that have higher statutory tax rate by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability result of gain on our foreign exchange risk management program or change in tax law regulation or accounting principle well certain discrete item various level of government such federal and state legislature and international organization such the organization for economic co operation and development oecd

shift of focus from operating the business to the transaction and in the case of an acquisition integration and administration the need to integrate the operation system including accounting management information compliance human resource and other administrative system technology product and personnel of each acquired company which is an inherently risky and potentially lengthy and costly process the inefficiency and lack of control that may result if such integration is delayed or not implemented and unforeseen difficulty and expenditure that may arise result the need to implement or improve control procedure and policy appropriate for larger public company at company that prior to acquisition may have lacked such control procedure and policy or whose control

customer credit or debit card bank account or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet transaction expense also includes fee paid to disbursement partner to enable transaction and interest expense on borrowing incurred to finance our portfolio of loan receivable arising from our paypal credit funding option we refer to the allocation of funding source used by our consumer our funding mix the cost of funding transaction with credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding transaction from bank or through internal source such paypal account balance or paypal credit we expand the availability of alternative funding source to our customer change in funding mix can increase or decrease our transaction expense rate for example in connection with our customer choice initiative we expect that our transaction expense rate will increase the cost of funding transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rate for transaction funded with credit card outside the than in the transaction expense increased million or in compared to the increase in transaction expense in wa primarily attributable to an increase in tpv which increased in transaction expense increased by million or in compared to the increase in transaction expense in wa primarily attributable to an

lossestransaction loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud and chargebacks loan loss include the loss associated with our paypal credit loan receivable portfolio we expect our transaction and loan loss to fluctuate depending on many factor including tpv macroeconomic condition change to our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our paypal credit product and working capital advance to select merchant seller additionally prior to the distribution we recovered certain amount from ebay related to customer protection program offered on eligible ebay purchase made with paypal these cost included the actual amount of protection loss associated with

recover amount from ebay associated with protection loss incurred on eligible ebay purchase instead we and ebay each independently administer our own customer protection program further our customer protection program extend to customer eligible purchase on ebay and therefore we have incurred and expect to continue to incur incremental cost associated with our customer protection program following the distribution the component of our transaction and loan loss for the year ended december and were follows year ended december percent increase decrease in million except percentage transaction loss loan transaction and loan loss transaction and loan loss increased million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to transaction loss increased by million or in compared to primarily attributable to higher tpv our transaction loss rate calculated by dividing transaction loss by tpv in wa flat compared to the growth in transaction loss in wa higher than the growth in tpv in due primarily to lower incremental cost in associated with our customer protection program following the distribution transaction loss increased by million or in compared to primarily attributable to higher tpv our transaction loss rate in increased compared to due to lower recovery in associated with transaction loss incurred on eligible ebay purchase offset by improved consumer loss performance and higher provision in the prior year from actual loss incurred loan loss increased million or in compared to and increased million or in compared to the increase in loan loss in wa

outstanding balance of million and million at december and respectively net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit loss on consumer loan receivables percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loan and interest receivables balance during the year represents percentage of balance which are day past the billing date to the consumer of contentswe offer credit product to certain existing small and medium sized merchant through our paypal working capital product the total paypal working capital advance and fee receivable merchant receivables outstanding of december and december were million and million respectively reflecting year over year increase of due to the increase in the availability of our credit product domestically and internationally to ass merchant seeking paypal working capital advance we use among other indicator risk model that we have internally developed that we refer to our paypal working capital risk model prm credit quality indicator to help predict the merchant ability to repay the principal balance and fixed fee related to the working capital advance the prm us multiple variable predictor of the merchant ability to repay working capital advance primary driver of the model include the merchant annual payment volume and payment processing history with paypal prior repayment history with the paypal working capital product and other measure merchant are assigned prm credit score within the range of to we generally expect that merchant to which we extend working capital advance will have prm score greater than we generally consider score above to be very good and to pose le credit risk we ass participating merchant prm score on recurring basis at december and december the weighted average prm score related to our paypal working capital balance outstanding wa and respectively the determination of the number of day our merchant receivables are outstanding is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee compared to the original expected repayment period we generally calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant estimated future payment volume so that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is expected to occur within to month from the date of the advance on regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the repayment activity on the receivable such actual repayment

following the distribution growth in our portfolio of loan receivables originated through paypal credit product increase our liquidity need and any failure to meet those liquidity need could adversely

estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statement an accounting estimate is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit committee of our board of director our significant accounting policy including recent accounting pronouncement are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated annual financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investor the amount used to ass sensitivity are included to allow user of this report to understand general direction cause and effect of change in the estimate and do not represent management prediction of variability for all of these estimate it should be noted that future event rarely develop exactly forecasted and estimate require regular review and adjustment transaction and loan lossestransaction and loan loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud chargebacks and credit loss associated with our loan receivable balance we expect our transaction and loan loss to fluctuate depending on many factor including total tpv macroeconomic condition change to our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our paypal credit product and working capital advance to selected merchant seller we establish allowance for estimated transaction loss arising from processing customer transaction such chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery of good or service ach return buyer protection program claim account takeover and account overdraft addition to the allowance in the form of provision are reflected in transaction and loan loss in our consolidated statement of income the allowance are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claim data reported by our claim processor and other actual data received the allowance are based on known fact and circumstance internal factor including experience with similar case historical trend involving loss payment pattern and the mix of transaction and loss type we also establish an allowance for loan receivable which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan loss inherent in our consumer loan receivable and merchant working capital advance increase to the allowance for loan receivable are reflected transaction and loan loss in our consolidated financial statement this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimate and judgment for our consumer loan receivable the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate are the percentage of balance which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate are applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loan which have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off for merchant working capital advance the allowance is primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model of contentsthe determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant working capital advance is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee compared to the original expected repayment period we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within to month from the date of the advance on regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable such actual repayment period are dependent on actual payment processing volume the allowance for loss against the interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fee receivable is primarily based on fee balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model increase to the allowance for interest receivable is reflected reduction of net revenue in our consolidated statement of income increase to the allowance for fee receivable is recognized reduction in deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet we charge off consumer loan receivable balance in the month in which customer balance becomes day past the payment due date we charge off the merchant receivable when the updated repayment period is day past the original expected repayment period and the merchant ha not made payment in the last day we also charge off the receivable when the updated repayment period is day past the original expected repayment period regardless of whether or not the merchant ha made payment within the last day bankrupt account are charged off within day of receiving notification from the bankruptcy court loan receivable past the payment due date continue to accrue interest until such time they are charged off with the portion of the reserve related to the interest receivable balance classified reduction of revenue determining appropriate allowance for these loss is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate loss may vary from the current estimate we regularly update our allowance estimate new fact become known and event occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of loss the allowance are maintained at level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for loss incurred at the balance sheet date based on our result for the year ended december an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan loss by approximately million accounting for income taxesour annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax law and regulation our income tax rate depends on the extent that our earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning our future operation to the extent we do not intend to repatriate these earnings to fund operation we do not provide for federal income and foreign withholding tax on these earnings deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate that are based on number of factor including our historical experience and short range and long range business forecast to the extent deferred tax asset are not expected to be realized we record valuation allowance we recognize and measure uncertain tax position in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report liability for unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return gaap further requires that change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax position be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalty if any related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we file annual income tax return in multiple taxing jurisdiction around the world number of year may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authority and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final of contentsoutcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserve for income tax are adequate such that we reflect the benefit more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserve well the related interest where appropriate in light of changing fact and circumstance settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our result for the year ended december one percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately million loss contingencieswe are currently involved in various claim legal proceeding and investigation of potential operating violation by regulatory oversight authority we regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim litigation or other violation and may revise our estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome revenue recognitionapplication of the various accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires to make judgment and estimate complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are principal to transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payment to consumer and merchant which require judgment to determine whether the payment should be recorded reduction to gross revenue change in judgment with respect to these assumption and estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangiblesthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination and asset impairment review require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires to estimate the fair value of asset acquired liability assumed and any non controlling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between asset that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset our estimate are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuation require the use of management assumption which would not reflect unanticipated event and circumstance that may occur we evaluate goodwill and intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist under the financial accounting standard board fasb guidance the evaluation of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to the fasb guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event legal and regulatory factor and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset are le than their carrying amount we must perform quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measure amount at which the unit whole could be bought or sold in current transaction between

result we will be exposed to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing under the revolving credit facility of december no borrowing or letter of credit were outstanding under the credit agreement interest rate may also adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to higher payment obligation by customer to and other lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer loan obligation which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore may lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net earnings basis point increase in interest rate would not have

the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and subsequently reclassified into revenue in the same period the forecasted transaction affect earnings the ineffective portion of the unrealized gain and loss on these contract if any is recorded immediately in earnings of contentswe considered the historical trend in currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that change in exchange rate of for all currency could be experienced in the near term if the dollar weakened by at december and december the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately million and million lower respectively if the dollar strengthened by at december and december the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately million and million higher respectively we have an additional

liability the foreign currency gain and loss on our asset and liability are recorded in other income expense net which is offset by the gain and loss on the foreign currency exchange contract adverse change in exchange rate of for all currency would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income tax of approximately million and million at december and december respectively without considering the offsetting effect of hedging foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net negative impact of approximately million foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net negative impact of approximately million these reasonably possible adverse change in currency exchange rate of were applied to total monetary asset and liability denominated in currency other than the

are applied to principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loan which have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off for merchant working capital advance the allowance is primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model the determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant working capital advance is based on the current expected repayment period of the advance and fixed fee compared to the original expected repayment period we calculate the repayment rate based on the merchant expected future payment volume such that repayment of the advance and fixed fee is typically expected to occur within to month from the date of the advance on regular basis we recalculate the repayment period based on the actual repayment activity on the receivable such actual repayment period are dependent on actual payment processing volume see note loan and interest receivable net for additional information on the delinquency status of our paypal credit portfolio of receivables the allowance for loss against interest receivable is primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of account that have incurred loss and are probable to be charged off the allowance for fee receivable is primarily based on fee balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model increase to the allowance for interest receivable is reflected reduction of net revenue in our consolidated

degree of influence the new guidance eliminates the requirement for retrospective adjustment of the investment result of operation and retained earnings if the equity method had been in effect during

previously held interest and equity method accounting would be adopted of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting the new standard is effective for fiscal year and

of the expected credit loss cecl cecl requires loss estimate for the remaining estimated life of the financial instrument using historical experience current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast generally we expect that cecl will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for loss compared to the current approach of estimating probable incurred loss credit loss on available for sale debt security with unrealized loss will be recognized allowance for credit loss limited to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost additional disclosure will be required including
