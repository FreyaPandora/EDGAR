amphotericin lipid complex injection sold by enzon pharmaceutical inc in the united state canada and japan and by zeneus pharma ltd in europe amphotec amphotericin cholesteryl sulfate complex for injection sold by three river pharmaceutical llc worldwide and anfogen amphotericin liposomal sold by genpharma in argentina bm and numerous generic manufacturer sell conventional amphotericin which also competes with ambisome are aware of at least three lipid formulation that claim similarity to ambisome becoming available outside of the united state including the possible entry of such formulation in taiwan these formulation may reduce market demand for ambisome the manufacture of lipid formulation of amphotericin is very complex and if any of these formulation are found to be unsafe sale of ambisome may be negatively impacted by association macugen competes primarily with visudyne verteporfin for injection which is sold by novartis and used in connection with photodynamic therapy and lucentis ranibizumab which is sold by genentech inc in the united state and novartis in territory outside the united state number of company are pursuing the development of technology which are competitive with our research program these competing company include specialized pharmaceutical firm and large pharmaceutical company acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical company furthermore academic institution government agency and other public and private organization conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangement for competitive product and program collaborative relationship part of our business strategy we establish collaboration with other company university and medical research institution to assist in the clinical development and or commercialization of certain of our product and product candidate and to provide support for our research program we also evaluate opportunity for acquiring

research scientist in foster city fremont san dimas and oceanside california branford connecticut seattle washington and alberta canada engaged in the discovery and development of new molecule and technology that we hope will lead to the approval of new medicine addressing unmet need the development of our product candidate is subject to various risk and uncertainty these risk and uncertainty include our ability to enroll patient in clinical trial the possibility of unfavorable result of our clinical trial the need to modify or delay our clinical trial or to perform additional trial and

litigation prior to issuance of the court decision under the agreement lupin will be allowed to launch generic version of ranexa on february patent protection and certain challenge patent and other proprietary right are very important to our business if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology patent covering certain of the active pharmaceutical ingredient of atripla truvada complera eviplera stribild letairis emtriva hepsera and vitekta are held by third party we acquired exclusive right to these patent in the agreement we have with these party patent do not cover the ranolazine compound the active ingredient of ranexa instead when it wa discovered that only sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma level patent were obtained on those formulation and the characteristic plasma level they achieve patent do not cover the active ingredient in ambisome we may obtain patent for certain product many year marketing approval is obtained for those product because patent have limited life which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in some country for example extension for the patent or supplementary protection certificate on many of our product have been granted in the united state and in number of european country compensating in part for delay in obtaining marketing approval similar patent term extension may be available for other product that we are developing but we can not be certain we will obtain them in some country is also important that we do not infringe the valid patent of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of body of patent that may relate to our operation of letairis education and access program leap our restricted distribution program designed to support letairis and we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir and the use of the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir because patent application are confidential for period of time until patent is issued we may not know if our competitor have filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in interference derivation proceeding or litigation to determine the right to patent litigation and interference derivation proceeding are unpredictable and expensive such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event patent relating to pharmaceutical biopharmaceutical and biotechnology product compound and process such those that cover our existing compound product and process and those that we will likely file in the future do not always provide complete or adequate protection future litigation or other proceeding regarding the enforcement or validity of our existing patent or any future patent could result in the invalidation of our patent or substantially reduce their protection from time to time certain individual or entity may challenge our patent our pending patent application and the patent application filed by our collaborative partner may not result in the issuance of any patent or may result in patent that do not provide adequate protection result we may not be able to prevent third party from developing compound or product that are closely related to those which we have developed or are developing in addition certain country in south america africa and asia including brazil and china do not provide effective enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer may be able to sell generic version of our product in those country litigation regarding sofosbuvirin january we acquired pharmasset inc pharmasset through the acquisition we acquired sofosbuvir nucleotide analog that act to inhibit the replication of the hcv in december we received fda approval of sofosbuvir now known commercially sovaldi in october we also received approval of the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir now known commercially harvoni we have received number of intellectual property claim regarding sofosbuvir we have carefully considered these claim both prior to and following the acquisition and believe they are without merit we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing sovaldi or harvoni for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may be alleged by such party to cover the use of sovaldi and harvoni we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to sovaldi or harvoni and we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending these claim if these party successfully obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by sovaldi and or harvoni we could be prevented from selling these product unless we were able to obtain license under such patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all interference proceeding and litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc idenix in february we received notice that the patent and trademark office uspto declared interference no first idenix interference between our patent no the patent and idenix pending patent application no an interference is an administrative proceeding before the uspto designed to determine who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both party our patent cover metabolite of sofosbuvir idenix is attempting to patent class of compound including these metabolite the purpose of the first idenix interference wa to determine who wa first to invent these compound and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compound in march the uspto patent trial and appeal board the board determined that idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of it early application filing date because none of those patent application including the application granted patent no the patent taught to make the compound in dispute the board also determined that because we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application we were first to file the patent application on the compound in dispute and we were therefore the senior party in the first idenix interference on january the board determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the compound in dispute and accordingly gilead prevailed in the first idenix interference in it decision the board held that idenix failed to prove that it wa first to conceive of any of the compound in dispute specifically idenix failed to prove that the idenix inventor had identified the structure method of making and use for any of the disputed compound the board went on to conclude that idenix failed to work diligently toward making and testing the compound in dispute during the relevant time period idenix ha appealed the board decision to the district court for the district of delaware in december after receiving our request to do the uspto declared interference no second idenix interference between our pending patent application no and the patent the patent includes claim directed to method of treating hcv with nucleoside compound similar to those which were involved in the first idenix interference the second idenix interference will determine who wa first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv on january the board issued decision in favor of gilead in the first phase of the second idenix interference the board decided that we were first to file the patent application on the disputed method of treating hcv designated gilead the senior party in the second idenix interference and invalidated the patent claim of the idenix patent that are involved in the second idenix interference the senior party we are presumed to be the first to have invented the disputed method of treating hcv because idenix failed to teach how to make and use the invention in it patent the board invalidated the idenix claim involved in the second idenix interference for lack of enablement the board ha also placed idenix under an order to show cause requiring idenix to explain judgment should not be entered against it in the second idenix interference based upon the decision by the board in the first idenix interference the decision in the second idenix interference is consistent with the board earlier ruling in march and january in the first idenix interference in which gilead wa declared the senior party and the first to invent certain fluoro methyl nucleoside compound these compound are relevant to the method of treating hcv at issue in the second idenix interference we believe that the idenix claim involved in the first and second idenix interference and similar and foreign patent claiming the same compound metabolite and us thereof are invalid result we filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada to invalidate idenix canadian patent no the patent which is the canadian patent that corresponds to the patent and the idenix patent application that wa the subject of the first idenix interference idenix ha asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in canada will infringe it patent and that our canadian patent no corresponding to the patent involved in the first idenix interference is invalid trial on these issue commenced in january we filed similar legal action in norway in the oslo district court seeking to invalidate idenix norwegian patent corresponding to the patent in september idenix filed an invalidation action in the norwegian proceeding against our norwegian patent no patent which corresponds to the patent on march the norwegian court found all claim in the idenix norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claim in the challenged gilead patent on april idenix appealed the march decision to the norwegian court of appeal idenix obligation to pay our attorney fee will be stayed during the pendency of the appeal the appeal from the march decision is scheduled to commence in february in august and april idenix filed two separate request for invalidation with the chinese patent office of our chinese patent cn which corresponds to our patent in august idenix withdrew it invalidation request and the chinese proceeding were terminated with our challenged patent remaining valid and enforceable in january we filed legal action in the federal court of australia seeking to invalidate idenix australian patent corresponding to the patent in april idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in australia will infringe the australian patent corresponding to the patent trial on these issue is scheduled to commence in september in sydney on march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent also on that day idenix initiated infringement proceeding against gilead in the united kingdom uk germany and france alleging that the commercialization of sovaldi in those country would infringe the respective national counterpart of the patent in the united kingdom trial wa held in october to determine the issue of infringement and validity of the idenix uk patent in december the high court of justice of england and wale uk court invalidated all claim of the patent on multiple ground specifically the uk court held that the patent lacked novelty over our earlier filed patent application teaching some of the same compound the patent lacked an inventive step because it not add anything to the knowledge existing at the time the disclosure in the idenix patent application wa insufficient because it did not teach how to make the compound or show which of the claimed compound would have activity against virus like the hepatitis virus on january the uk court held hearing at which the court ordered idenix to pay of gilead cost with an interim payment due within day of the hearing the uk court granted idenix permission to appeal the december judgment on february the german court in düsseldorf held hearing to determine the issue of infringement of the idenix german patent we expect decision in mid march we do not have trial date for the french lawsuit idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent issue we expect to challenge them in proceeding similar to those we invoked in other country in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no and on june the court in massachusetts granted our request and transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware we believe that idenix patent are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir the district court ha set trial date in october and december for resolution of these issue decision by the district court can be appealed by either party to the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc idenix wa acquired by merck in august the acquisition not change our view of the lack of merit in the claim made by idenix merck ha greater resource than idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher level than idenix litigation with merckin august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no and which it co owns with isi pharmaceutical inc we believe that merck patent are invalid and are not infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir in august we filed lawsuit in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed merck patent no and cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir with the apparent goal of ultimately extracting royalty payment for sofosbuvir commercialization or eliminating competition by excluding it from the market if the court determines that merck patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to merck to commercialize sofosbuvir either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the court ha set trial date of march for this lawsuit litigation with abbvie inc abbvie abbvie ha obtained patent no and abbvie patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir or harvoni for the treatment of hcv gilead is aware that abbvie ha pending patent application in the united state and other country we own published and pending patent application directed to the use of combination for the treatment of hcv and specifically to the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir certain of our application were filed before the abbvie patent for this reason and others we believe the abbvie patent are invalid accordingly in december we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the abbvie patent are invalid and unenforceable well other relief we believe that abbott laboratory inc and abbvie conspired to eliminate competition in the hcv market by falsely representing to the uspto that they and not gilead invented method of treating hcv using combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir in february and march abbvie responded to our lawsuit by filing two lawsuit also in the district court for the district of delaware alleging that our fixed dose combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir will infringe it patent all of those lawsuit have been consolidated into single action in the united state either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the abbvie patent have not blocked or delayed the commercialization of our combination product in the united state or europe we do not expect any other foreign patent to block or delay the commercialization around the world if court determines that the abbvie patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to abbvie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination product with generic manufacturer part of the approval process for some of our product the fda granted new chemical entity nce exclusivity period during which other manufacturer application for approval of generic version of our product will not be approved generic manufacturer may challenge the patent protecting product that have been granted nce exclusivity one year prior to the end of the nce exclusivity period generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval for similar or identical drug through an abbreviated new drug application anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate emtricitabine and fixed dose combination of emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenzin and we received notice that teva pharmaceutical teva submitted an anda to the fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of truvada in april we and teva reached an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the patent that protect tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in atripla truvada and viread under the agreement teva will be allowed to launch generic version of viread on december in april we and teva entered into an agreement to settle the ongoing patent litigation concerning the emtricitabine patent that protect atripla and truvada term of the settlement are confidential in november we received notice that teva submitted an ands to the canadian minister of health requesting permission to manufacture and market generic fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate in the notice teva alleges that three of the patent associated with truvada are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by teva manufacture use or sale of generic version of truvada in january we filed lawsuit against teva in the federal court of canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ands in december we received notice that teva submitted an ands to the canadian minister of health requesting permission to manufacture and market generic fixed dose combination of emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz in the notice teva alleges that three of our patent associated with atripla and two of merck patent associated with atripla are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by teva manufacture use or sale of generic fixed dose combination of emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz in february we filed lawsuit against teva in the federal court of canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ands in august we received notice that teva submitted an ands to the canadian minister of health requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of viread in the notice teva alleges that two patent associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are

canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ands also in august teva filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada seeking invalidation of our two canadian patent associated with viread we are currently defending that impeachment action the request for order of prohibition in connection with all three of teva ands filing for teva generic version of viread truvada and atripla were consolidated and in december the court issued our requested order prohibiting the canadian minister of health from issuing notice of compliance for teva generic version of our viread truvada and atripla product until expiry of our patent in july teva ha appealed that decision that decision did not rule on the validity of the patent and accordingly the only issue on appeal is whether the minister of health should be prohibited from issuing the notice of compliance for teva product separately the court will determine the validity of the patent in the pending impeachment action trial in the impeachment action is scheduled for september if teva is successful in invalidating our patent teva may be able to launch generic version of our viread truvada and atripla product

lawsuit against apotex in the future should we decide that it is necessary to protect the exclusivity of the product we can not predict the ultimate outcome of these action and we may spend significant resource enforcing and defending these patent if we are unsuccessful in these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for truvada viread lexiscan and tamiflu in the united state and atripla truvada and viread in canada could be substantially shortened if all of the patent covering one or more product are invalidated the fda or canadian minister of health could approve the request to manufacture generic version of such product in the united state or canada respectively prior to the expiration date of those patent the sale of generic version of these product earlier than their patent expiration would have significant negative effect on our revenue and result of operation trade secret we also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know how and technological innovation in particular great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise which is key component of our liposomal technology is not covered by patent but is instead protected trade secret we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor these agreement provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third party except in specified circumstance in the case of employee the agreement provide that all invention made by an individual while employed by will be our exclusive property we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention manufacturing and raw material our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third party to manufacture the majority of our active pharmaceutical ingredient and solid dose product we also rely on our corporate partner to manufacture certain of our product additionally we own or lease manufacturing facility in foster city san dimas and oceanside california edmonton alberta canada and cork ireland where we manufacture certain product and active pharmaceutical ingredient for clinical and commercial us manufacturing of our product we contract with third party to manufacture certain product for clinical and commercial purpose including sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread emtriva hepsera tybost vitekta ranexa ambisome zydelig and cayston we generally use multiple third party contract manufacturer to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient in our product we are the exclusive manufacturer of idelalisib the active pharmaceutical ingredient in zydelig and ambrisentan the active pharmaceutical ingredient of letairis although another supplier is qualified to make the active pharmaceutical ingredient in letairis we also rely on third party contract manufacturer to manufacture our tablet or capsule product for example we use multiple third party contract manufacturer to tablet sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread hepsera tybost vitekta letairis zydelig and ranexa and emtriva encapsulation is also completed by third party contract manufacturer we also have manufacturing agreement with many of our corporate partner roche by itself and through third party is responsible for manufacturing tamiflu under our agreement with roche through joint manufacturing committee composed of representative from roche and gilead we have the opportunity to review roche existing manufacturing capacity for tamiflu and global plan for manufacturing tamiflu astellas llc our corporate partner for lexiscan in the united state is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the united state and is dependent on single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of lexiscan our future product we continue to develop additional manufacturing capability and establish additional third party supplier to manufacture sufficient quantity of our product candidate to undertake clinical trial and to manufacture sufficient quantity of any product that is approved for commercial sale if we are unable to develop manufacturing capability internally or contract for large scale manufacturing with third party on acceptable term for our future product our ability to conduct large scale clinical trial and meet customer demand for commercial product will be adversely affected in addition we rely on third party contract manufacturer to manufacture our aseptic product such ambisome and cayston our manufacturing facility at our san dimas california manufacturing facility we package and label solid dosage oral form product including sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread ranexa zydelig and emtriva and label hepsera at our facility in san dimas we manufacture ambisome and cayston at our san dimas facility we depend on single supplier for the high quality cholesterol and the active pharmaceutical ingredient used in the manufacture of ambisome because we are the exclusive supplier of key drug product intermediate of ambisome in the event of disaster including an earthquake equipment failure or other difficulty we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in timely manner and may be unable to manufacture ambisome to meet market need we utilize our cork ireland facility primarily for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral product well product packaging activity we package and label drug product for sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread tybost and vitekta and label hepsera and emtriva at our facility in cork ireland we also perform quality control testing final labeling and secondary packaging of both ambisome and cayston and final release of many of our product for the european union and elsewhere at this facility we distribute our product to the european union and other international market from our dublin ireland site at our edmonton alberta facility in canada we carry out process research and scale up of our clinical development candidate manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredient for both investigational and commercial product and conduct chemical development activity to improve existing commercial manufacturing process we also manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient in letairis and hepsera exclusively at our edmonton site although another supplier is qualified to make the active pharmaceutical ingredient in letairis our oceanside california facility is designed and equipped to produce biologic compound for toxicological phase and phase clinical study we use the facility for the process development and manufacture of simtuzumab an investigational monoclonal antibody candidate in development for treatment of certain cancer and respiratory disease and other biologics third party manufacturer our third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risk which are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails to pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product for example in due to unexpected delay both in qualifying two new external site and with expanding cayston manufacturing in san dimas we were unable to supply enough cayston to fulfill our projected demand from february through september we suspended access for patient with new prescription for cayston subject to certain exception where specific medical need existed result of our inability to manufacture sufficient cayston to meet demand the amount of revenue we received from the sale of cayston wa reduced we believe the technology we use to manufacture our product is proprietary for product manufactured by our third party contract manufacturer we have disclosed all necessary aspect of this technology to enable them to manufacture the product for we have agreement with these third party manufacturer that are intended to restrict these manufacturer from using or revealing this technology but we can not be certain that these third party manufacturer will comply with these restriction in addition these third party manufacturer could develop their own technology related to the work they perform for that we may need to manufacture our product we could be required to enter into additional agreement with these third party manufacturer if we want to use that technology or allow another manufacturer to use that technology the third party manufacturer could refuse to allow to use their technology or could demand term to use their technology that are not acceptable to of manufacturing process the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is highly regulated and regulator may shut manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to current good manufacturing practice which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by the fda and the european medicine agency ema similar regulation are in effect in other country our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency for example in april the fda conducted an inspection of our foster city facility and issued form inspectional observation which noted deficiency in documentation and validation of certain quality testing procedure and method result of the observation the fda delivered complete response letter notifying that it wa unable to approve our ndas for elvitegravir and cobicistat standalone agent in mid october the fda completed it sofosbuvir pre approval inspection of our foster city facility following that inspection the fda issued additional form inspectional observation citing deficiency related to testing and reconciliation of stability sample testing protocol testing of shipping sample and procedure for calibrating test equipment we completed and filed our response to these observation with the fda in we received letter from fda related to the extent of method revalidations being conducted stability program oversight audit trail review data management and quality management system gap we have filed our response to these observation with the fda if we are unable to remedy the deficiency cited by the fda in these inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country if approval of any of our product candidate were delayed or if production of our marketed product wa interrupted our anticipated revenue and our stock price would be adversely affected access to supply and material we need access to certain supply and product to manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue for example significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread emtriva tybost and vitekta are supplied by china based company result an international trade dispute between china and the united state or any other action by the chinese government that would limit or prevent chinese company from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our hiv and hcv product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result seasonal operation and backlog our worldwide product sale do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality for the most part we operate in market characterized by short lead time and the absence of significant backlog we do not believe that backlog information is material to our business whole government regulation our operation and activity are subject to extensive regulation by numerous government authority in the united state and other country in the united state drug are subject to rigorous fda regulation the federal food drug and cosmetic act and other federal and state statute and regulation govern the testing manufacture safety efficacy labeling storage record keeping approval advertising and promotion of our product result of these regulation product development and product approval process are very expensive and time consuming the fda must approve drug before it can be sold in the united state the general process for this approval is follows preclinical testing before we can test drug candidate in human we must study the drug in laboratory experiment and in animal to generate data to support the drug candidate potential benefit and safety we submit this data to the fda in an investigational new drug ind application seeking it approval to test the compound in human clinical trial the fda accepts the ind the drug candidate can then be studied in human clinical trial to determine if the drug candidate is safe and effective these clinical trial involve three separate phase that often overlap can take many year and are very expensive these three phase which are subject to considerable regulation are follows phase the drug candidate is given to small number of healthy human control subject or patient suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety dose tolerance pharmacokinetics metabolism distribution and excretion phase the drug candidate is given to limited patient population to determine the effect of the drug candidate in treating the disease the best dose of the drug candidate and the possible side effect and safety risk of the drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous phase clinical trial phase if drug candidate appears to be effective and safe in phase clinical trial phase clinical trial are commenced to confirm those result phase clinical trial are conducted over longer term involve significantly larger population are conducted at numerous site in different geographic region and are carefully designed to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and benefit of drug candidate it is not uncommon for drug candidate that appears promising in phase clinical trial to fail in the more rigorous and extensive phase clinical trial fda approval process when we believe that the data from our clinical trial show an adequate level of safety and efficacy we submit the appropriate filing usually in the form of an nda or supplemental nda with the fda seeking approval to sell the drug candidate for particular use the fda may hold public hearing where an independent advisory committee of expert advisor asks additional question and make recommendation regarding the drug candidate this committee make recommendation to the fda that is not binding but is generally followed by the fda if the fda agrees that the compound ha met the required level of safety and efficacy for particular use it will allow to sell the drug candidate in the united state for that use it is not unusual however for the fda to reject an application because it belief that the drug candidate is not safe enough or efficacious enough or because it doe not believe that the data submitted is reliable or conclusive at any point in this process the development of drug candidate can be stopped for number of reason including safety concern and lack of treatment benefit we can not be certain that any clinical trial that we are currently conducting or any that we conduct in the future will be completed successfully or within any specified time period we may choose or the fda may require to delay or suspend our clinical trial at any time if it appears that the patient are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or if the drug candidate doe not appear to have sufficient treatment benefit the fda may also require phase non registrational study to explore scientific question to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of our drug the fda may also require to provide additional data or information improve our manufacturing process procedure or facility or may require extensive surveillance to monitor the safety or benefit of our product candidate if it determines that our filing doe not contain adequate evidence of the safety and benefit of the drug in addition even if the fda approves drug it could limit the us of the drug the fda can withdraw approval if it doe not believe that we are complying with regulatory standard or if problem are uncovered or occur after approval in addition to obtaining fda approval for each drug we obtain fda approval of the manufacturing facility for any drug we sell including those of company who manufacture our drug for all of these facility are subject to periodic inspection by the fda the fda must also approve foreign establishment that manufacture product to be sold in the united state and these facility are subject to periodic regulatory inspection our manufacturing facility located in california including our oceanside and san dimas facility also must be licensed by the state of california in compliance with local regulatory requirement our manufacturing facility located in canada including our edmonton alberta facility and our facility located near dublin and in cork ireland also must obtain local license and permit in compliance with local regulatory requirement drug that treat serious or life threatening disease and condition that are not adequately addressed by existing drug and for which the development program is designed to address the unmet medical need may be designated fast track candidate by the fda and may be eligible for accelerated and priority review drug for the treatment of hiv infection that are designated for use under the president emergency plan for aid relief may also qualify for an expedited or priority review sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni viread complera stribild viread and zydelig received accelerated approval and priority review drug receiving accelerated approval must be monitored in post marketing clinical trial in order to confirm the safety and benefit of the drug are also subject to extensive regulation outside of the united state in the european union there is centralized approval procedure that authorizes marketing of product in all country of the european union which includes most major country in europe if this centralized approval procedure is not used approval in one country of the european union can be used to obtain approval in another country of the european union under one of two simplified application process the mutual recognition procedure or the decentralized procedure both of which rely on the principle of mutual recognition after receiving regulatory approval through any of the european registration procedure separate pricing and reimbursement approval are also required in most country the european union also ha requirement for approval of manufacturing facility for all product that are approved for sale by the european regulatory authority pricing and reimbursement successful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment government health administration authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service which ha resulted in lower average selling price in the united state significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to significant discount from list price and rebate obligation in the hcv area we have experienced increased pricing pressure and in certain case have provided significant discount or rebate to private and public payer in order to obtain formulary status any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue we also expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue in addition state adaps which purchase significant portion of our hiv product rely on federal supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchase of our product in the past we have experienced shift in our payer mix for hiv patient previously covered by private insurance move to public reimbursement program that require rebate or discount from or patient previously covered by one public reimbursement program move to another public reimbursement program that requires greater rebate or discount from if federal and state fund are not available in amount sufficient to support the number of patient that rely on adaps sale of our hiv product could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenue in prior quarter because of the insufficiency of federal and state fund and many state reduced eligibility criterion we saw an increase in the number of patient on state adap waitlists and we may see similar increase in future period result of any reduction in federal and state adap support resulting from the sequestration until these patient are enrolled in an adap they generally receive product from industry supported patient assistance program or are unable to access treatment the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the united state will put additional pressure on product pricing reimbursement and usage which may adversely affect our product sale and profitability these pressure can arise from rule and practice of managed care group judicial decision and governmental law and regulation related to medicare medicaid and healthcare reform pharmaceutical reimbursement policy and pricing in general in july we received letter from the senate committee on finance requesting information and supporting documentation from related to sovaldi and the pricing of sovaldi in the united state the letter raised concern about our approach to pricing sovaldi it affordability and it impact on federal government spending and public health we are cooperating with the inquiry it is both costly and time consuming for to comply with these inquiry we can not predict the outcome it is possible that the inquiry could result in negative publicity or other negative action that could harm our reputation reduce demand for sovaldi harvoni or other sofosbuvir containing product and or reduce coverage of sovaldi harvoni or other sofosbuvir containing product including by federal health care program such medicare and medicaid if any or all of these event occur our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected in country outside the united state the success of our commercialized product and any other product candidate we may develop will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because in many country patient are unlikely to use prescription drug that are not reimbursed by their government in addition negotiating price with certain governmental authority can delay commercialization by month or more reimbursement policy may adversely affect our ability to sell our product on profitable basis in many international market government control the price of prescription pharmaceutical including through the implementation of reference pricing price cut rebate revenue related tax tender and profit control and they expect price of prescription pharmaceutical to decline over the life of the product or volume increase recently many country in the european union have increased the level of discounting required on our product and these effort could continue country attempt to manage healthcare expenditure especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crisis experienced by many country in the european union some country have instituted clawback and enacted tax on specific product generic drug come to market we may face price decrease for our product in some country in the european union further cost containment pressure in the european union especially in southern europe could lead delay in the treatment of patient and also delay pricing approval which could negatively impact the commercialization of new product government agency also issue regulation and guideline directly applicable to and to our product in addition from time to time professional society practice management group private health science foundation and organization publish guideline or recommendation directed to certain health care and patient community such recommendation and guideline may relate to such matter product usage dosage route of administration and use of related or competing therapy and can consequently result in increased or decreased usage of our product united state healthcare reform legislative and regulatory change to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state and foreign jurisdiction in march healthcare reform legislation wa adopted in the united state requiring to further rebate or discount product reimbursed or paid for by various public payer including medicaid and other entity eligible to purchase discounted product through the drug pricing program under the public health service act such adaps result of the legislation the discount rebate and fee that impacted include our minimum base rebate amount owed to medicaid on product reimbursed by medicaid increased by and the discount or rebate we owe to adaps and other public health service entity which reimburse or purchase our product also increased by we are required to extend rebate to patient receiving our product through medicaid managed care organization we are required to provide discount on product sold to patient while they are in the medicare part donut hole and we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of new industry fee also known the branded prescription drug fee the bpd fee of billion for calculated based on select government sale during the calendar year percentage of total industry government sale the amount of the annual industry fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry whole will be billion in through increase to billion in increase to peak of billion in and then decrease to billion in and thereafter we expect our portion of the bpd fee to increase our revenue grow and the amount of the annual industry fee increase through and drug patent expire on major drug of other company in addition during the third quarter of the internal revenue service irs issued final regulation which indicated that manufacturer obligation to pay it portion of the bpd fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sale in the previous year instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year result of the final irs regulation we were required to recognize our fee of million and fee of million in our consolidated statement of income our bpd fee were approximately million million and million in and respectively the bpd fee is not tax deductible further even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation discussion continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concession from pharmaceutical manufacturer or set minimum requirement for medicare part pricing in addition state medicaid program could request additional supplemental rebate on our product result of the increase in the federal base medicaid rebate private insurer could also use the enactment of these increased rebate to exert pricing pressure on our product and to the extent that private insurer or managed care program follow medicaid coverage and payment development the adverse effect may be magnified by private insurer adopting lower payment schedule health care fraud and abuse law and anti bribery law we are subject to various federal and state law pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including anti kickback law and false claim law anti kickback law make it illegal for prescription drug manufacturer to solicit offer receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business including the purchase or prescription of particular drug due to the breadth of the statutory provision and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authority it is possible that certain of our practice may be challenged under anti kickback or similar law false claim law generally prohibit anyone from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claim for payment by federal and certain state payer including medicare and medicaid or knowingly making using or causing to be made or used false record or statement material to false or fraudulent claim our sale marketing and medical activity may be subject to scrutiny under these law in addition the foreign corrupt practice act and similar worldwide anti bribery law generally prohibit company and their intermediary from making improper payment for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business our policy mandate compliance with these anti bribery law we operate in part of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree in certain circumstance strict compliance with anti bribery law may conflict with local custom and practice or may require to interact with doctor and hospital some of which may be state controlled in manner that is different than local custom despite our training and compliance program internal control policy and procedure may not protect from reckless or criminal act committed by our employee or agent violation of fraud and abuse law or anti bribery law may be punishable by criminal and or civil sanction including fine and civil monetary penalty well the possibility of exclusion from federal health care program including medicare and medicaid violation can also lead to the imposition of corporate integrity agreement or similar government oversight program if the government were to allege against or convict of violating these law there could be disruption on our business and material adverse effect on our result of operation compulsory license in number of developing country government official and other interested group have suggested that pharmaceutical company should make drug for hcv or hiv infection available at low cost alternatively government in those developing country could require that we grant compulsory license to allow competitor to manufacture and sell their own version of our product thereby reducing our product sale for example there is growing attention on the availability of hcv therapy and some activist are advocating for the increased availability of hcv therapy through mean including compulsory license in the past certain office of the government of brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our hiv product and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory license to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented product for hiv infection including viread in addition concern over the cost and availability of tamiflu related to potential avian flu pandemic and influenza generated international discussion over compulsory licensing of our tamiflu patent for example the canadian government considered allowing canadian manufacturer to manufacture and export the active ingredient in tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed country under canada access to medicine regime furthermore roche issued voluntary license to permit third party manufacturing of tamiflu for example roche granted sublicense to shanghai pharmaceutical group co ltd for china and sublicense to india hetero drug limited for india and certain developing country if compulsory license permit generic manufacturing to override our product patent for sovaldi harvoni our hiv product or tamiflu or if we are required to grant compulsory license for these product it could reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in addition certain country do not permit enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer are able to sell generic version of our product in those country compulsory license or sale of generic version of our product could significantly reduce our sale and adversely affect our result of operation particularly if generic version of our product are imported into territory where we have existing commercial sale employeesas of january we had approximately full time employee we believe we have good relation with our employee environment health and safety we have evaluated our current level of environmental impact and have identified way to reduce our energy consumption some factor that contribute to our environmental impact include greenhouse gas emission produced by employee commute the energy and water consumed by our facility and the use of hazardous material such chemical virus and radioactive compound in our facility pursuant to our evaluation we have taken some initial measure to address these impact for example we have established employee commuter program evaluated the energy efficiency of our building and installed low flow water fixture we have also implemented proactive program to minimize the occurrence of hazardous material incident and to reduce the risk of accidental environmental contamination and worker injury we are subject to number of law and regulation that require compliance with federal state and local regulation regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment we anticipate additional regulation in the near future law and regulation are implemented and under consideration to mitigate the effect of climate change mainly caused by greenhouse gas emission our business is not energy intensive therefore we do not anticipate being subject to cap and trade system or other mitigation measure that would materially impact our capital expenditure operation or competitive position based on current information and subject to the finalization of proposed regulation we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is increased energy cost we use hazardous material chemical virus and various radioactive compound in our activity and can not eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these material misuse or accident involving hazardous material could lead to significant litigation fine and penalty information we are subject to the information requirement of the exchange act therefore we file periodic report proxy statement and other information with the sec such report proxy statement and other information may be obtained by visiting the public reference room of the sec at street ne washington or by calling the sec at sec by sending an electronic message to the sec at publicinfo sec gov or by sending fax to the sec at in addition the sec maintains website www sec gov that contains report proxy and information statement and other information regarding issuer that file electronically the mailing address of our headquarters is lakeside drive foster city california and our telephone number at that location is our website is www gilead com through link on the investor section of our website under sec filing in the financial information section we make available the following filing soon reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the sec our annual report on form quarterly report on form current report on form and any amendment to those report filed or furnished pursuant to section or of the exchange act all such filing are available free of charge upon request transaction with iran we did not have any transaction with iran during that would require disclosure in this annual report on form risk factor in evaluating our business you should carefully consider the following risk in addition to the other information in this annual report on form manifestation of any of the following risk could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition we note these factor for investor permitted by the private security litigation reform act of it is not possible to predict or identify all such factor and therefore you should not consider the following risk to be complete statement of all the potential risk or uncertainty that we face substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hcv and hiv if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sale of these product our result of operation may be adversely affected during the year ended december sale of sovaldi and harvoni for the treatment of hcv accounted for approximately of our total product sale since sovaldi and harvoni were only recently launched we can not be certain if sale of our hcv product are indicative of future sale with the approval of competitor hcv product in december and the potential entry of other competitive product we can not predict whether and to extent our hcv revenue may be adversely affected in the future result of the launch of competing regimen we have experienced and may continue to experience increased pricing pressure in certain case we have provided significant discount or rebate to public and private payer in order to obtain formulary status or to expand access for patient to our hcv product in addition future sale of sovaldi and harvoni are difficult to estimate because demand depends in part on the extent of reimbursement of our hcv product by private and public payer in the united state and country outside the united state in light of the continued fiscal and debt crisis experienced by several country in the european union several government have announced or implemented measure to manage healthcare expenditure we continue to experience pricing pressure such increase in the amount of discount required on our product and delayed reimbursement which could negatively impact our future product sale and result of operation also private and public payer can choose to exclude sovaldi or harvoni from their formulary or limit the type of patient for coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of sovaldi and harvoni any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue if we are unable to maintain the current or expected future sale level of sovaldi and harvoni or obtain approval or reimbursement for our hcv product candidate in the currently anticipated timeline our result of operation and stock price could be negatively affected we receive substantial portion of our revenue from sale of our product for the treatment of hiv infection particularly our single tablet regimen product atripla complera eviplera and stribild during the year ended december sale of our hiv product accounted for more than of our total product sale most of our hiv product contain tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and or emtricitabine which belong to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutic if the treatment paradigm for hiv change causing nucleoside based therapeutic to fall out of favor or if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing our hiv product sale our result of operation would likely suffer and we would likely need to scale back our operation including our spending on research and development effort we may not be able to sustain or increase the growth rate of sale of our hiv product especially atripla complera eviplera and stribild for any number of reason including but not limited to the following our hiv product are used over longer period of time in many patient and in combination with other product and additional study are conducted new issue with respect to safety resistance and interaction with other drug may arise which could cause to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label narrow our approved indication or halt sale of product each of which could reduce our revenue our hiv product mature private insurer and government payer often reduce the amount they will reimburse patient for these product which increase pressure on to reduce price large part of the market for our hiv product consists of patient who are already taking other hiv drug if physician do not see the benefit of our hiv product the sale of our hiv product will be limited generic hiv product are introduced into major market our ability to maintain pricing and market share may be affected for example generic version of sustiva efavirenz component of our atripla are now available in canada and europe and we anticipate competition from generic efavirenz in the united state in december we have observed some pricing pressure related to the sustiva component of our atripla sale we fail to commercialize new product or expand the indication for existing product our prospect for future revenue may be adversely affected if we do not introduce new product to market or increase sale of our existing product we will not be able to increase or maintain our total revenue continue to expand our effort drug development is inherently risky and many product candidate fail during the drug development process for example we recently announced result from our phase study of simtuzumab for the treatment of pancreatic cancer myelofibrosis and colorectal cancer showing that the product candidate did not provide clinical benefit in june we submitted nda with japan pharmaceutical and medical device agency pmda for approval of sofosbuvir for the treatment of hcv and in september we submitted nda with the pmda for approval of the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir in the fourth quarter of we filed our marketing application for approval of the single tablet regimen of elvitegravir cobicistat emtricitabine and taf for the treatment of hiv infection in adult in the united state and european union these marketing application may not be approved by the regulatory authority on timely basis or at all even if marketing approval is granted for these product there may be significant limitation on their use further we may be unable to file our marketing application for new product our inability to accurately predict demand for our product the uptake of new product or the timing of fluctuation in the inventory maintained by customer make it difficult for to accurately forecast sale and may cause our revenue and earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our financial result and our stock price we may be unable to accurately predict demand for our product including the uptake of new product demand is dependent on number of factor for example our hcv product sovaldi and harvoni represent significant change in the treatment paradigm for hcv infected patient due to the shortened duration of treatment and the reduction or elimination of the need for pegylated interferon injection and ribavirin in certain patient population because these product are in new therapeutic area for and product demand is dependent on number of factor revenue from these product in and beyond are difficult for and investor to estimate demand for sovaldi and harvoni will depend in part on the extent of reimbursement of our hcv product by private and public payer in the united state and country outside the united state private and public payer can choose to exclude sovaldi or harvoni from their formulary or limit the type of patient for whom coverage will be provided which would negatively impact the demand for and revenue of sovaldi and harvoni also because our hcv product represent significant change in the treatment paradigm of hcv infection and in light of the launch of competitor regimen sale level or prescription growth rate early in the launch may not be indicative of future sale result of the launch of competing regimen we have experienced increased pricing pressure in the united state and in certain case have provided significant discount to private and public payer in order to obtain formulary status or to expand access for patient to our hcv product any change in the formulary coverage reimbursement level or discount or rebate offered on our hcv product to payer may negatively impact our anticipated revenue we expect pricing pressure in the hcv market to continue because hcv related revenue are difficult to predict investor may have widely varying expectation that may be materially higher or lower than our actual revenue to the extent our hcv product revenue exceed or fall short of these expectation our stock price may experience significant volatility in the year ended december approximately of our product sale in the united state were to three wholesaler amerisourcebergen corp mckesson corp and cardinal health inc the wholesaler with whom we have entered into inventory management agreement make estimate to determine end user demand and may not be completely effective in matching their inventory level to actual end user demand result change in inventory level held by those wholesaler can cause our operating result to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sale to these wholesaler do not match end user demand in addition inventory is held at retail pharmacy and other non wholesaler location with whom we have no inventory management agreement and no control over buying pattern adverse change in economic condition or other factor may cause retail pharmacy to reduce their inventory of our product which would reduce their order from wholesaler and consequently the wholesaler order from even if end user demand ha not changed for example during the fourth quarter of strong wholesaler and sub wholesaler purchase of our hiv product resulted in inventory draw down by wholesaler and sub wholesaler in the first quarter of inventory in the distribution channel fluctuates from quarter to quarter we may continue to see fluctuation in our earnings and mismatch between prescription demand for our product and our revenue in addition the non retail sector in the united state which includes government institution including state aid drug assistance program adaps correctional facility and large health maintenance organization tends to be even le consistent in term of buying pattern and often cause quarter over quarter fluctuation that do not necessarily mirror patient demand for our product federal and state budget pressure including sequestration well the annual grant cycle for federal and state adap fund may cause adap purchasing pattern to not reflect patient demand of our hiv product for example in the first quarter of certain prior year we observed large non retail purchase of our hiv product by number state adaps that exceeded patient demand we believe such purchase were driven by the grant cycle for federal adap fund we expect to continue to experience fluctuation in the purchasing pattern of our non retail customer which may result in fluctuation in our product sale revenue and earnings in the future in light of the global economic downturn and budget crisis faced by many european country we have observed variation in purchasing pattern induced by cost containment measure in europe we believe these measure have caused some government agency and other purchaser to reduce inventory of our product in the distribution channel which ha decreased our revenue and caused fluctuation in our product sale and earnings we may continue to see this trend in the future our result of operation may be adversely affected by current and potential future healthcare reform legislative and regulatory change to government prescription drug procurement and reimbursement program occur relatively frequently in the united state and foreign jurisdiction in march healthcare reform legislation wa adopted in the united state requiring to further rebate or discount product reimbursed or paid for by various public payer including medicaid and other entity eligible to purchase discounted product through the drug pricing program under the public health service act such adaps result of the legislation the discount rebate and fee that impacted include our minimum base rebate amount owed to medicaid on product reimbursed by medicaid increased by and the discount or rebate we owe to adaps and other public health service entity which reimburse or purchase our product also increased by we are required to extend rebate to patient receiving our product through medicaid managed care organization we are required to provide discount on product sold to patient while they are in the medicare part donut hole and we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of new industry fee also known the branded prescription drug bpd fee of billion for calculated based on select government sale during the calendar year percentage of total industry government sale the amount of the annual industry fee imposed on the pharmaceutical industry whole will be billion in through increase to billion in increase to peak of billion in and then decrease to billion in and thereafter we expect our portion of the bpd fee to increase our revenue grow and the amount of the annual industry fee increase through and drug patent expire on major drug of other company in addition during the third quarter of the internal revenue service irs issued final regulation which indicated that manufacturer obligation to pay it portion of the bpd fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sale in the previous year instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year result of the final irs regulation we were required to recognize our fee of million and fee of million in our consolidated statement of income our bpd fee were approximately million million and million in and respectively the bpd fee is not tax deductible further even though not addressed in the healthcare reform legislation discussion continue at the federal level on legislation that would either allow or require the federal government to directly negotiate price concession from pharmaceutical manufacturer or set minimum requirement for medicare part pricing in addition state medicaid program could request additional supplemental rebate on our product result of the increase in the federal base medicaid rebate private insurer could also use the enactment of these increased rebate to exert pricing pressure on our product and to the extent that private insurer or managed care program follow medicaid coverage and payment development the adverse effect may be magnified by private insurer adopting lower payment schedule our existing product are subject to reimbursement from government agency and other third party pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressure may reduce profitability successful commercialization of our product depends in part on the availability of governmental and third party payer reimbursement for the cost of such product and related treatment government health administration authority private health insurer and other organization generally provide reimbursement in the united state the european union and other significant or potentially significant market for our product and product candidate government authority and third party payer are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical product and service which ha resulted in lower average selling price significant portion of our sale of the majority of our product are subject to significant discount from list price and rebate obligation in the united state state adaps which purchase significant portion of our hiv product rely on federal supplemental federal and state funding to help fund purchase of our product in the past we have experienced shift in our payer mix for hiv patient previously covered by private insurance move to public reimbursement program that require rebate or discount from or patient previously covered by one public reimbursement program move to another reimbursement program that requires greater rebate or discount from if federal and state fund are not available in amount sufficient to support the number of patient that rely on adaps sale of our hiv product could be negatively impacted which would reduce our revenue in prior quarter because of the insufficiency of federal and state fund and many state reduced eligibility criterion we saw an increase in the number of patient on state adap waitlists and we may see similar increase in future period result of any reduction in federal and state adap support resulting from the sequestration until these patient are enrolled in an adap they generally receive product from industry supported patient assistance program or are unable to access treatment the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the united state and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement control in the european union will put additional pressure on product pricing reimbursement and usage which may adversely affect our product sale and profitability these pressure can arise from rule and practice of managed care group judicial decision and governmental law and regulation related to medicare medicaid and healthcare reform pharmaceutical reimbursement policy and pricing in general we have also experienced increased pricing pressure in the united state and in certain case have provided discount to private payer in order to obtain formulary status or to expand access for patient to our hcv product see also our risk factor substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sale of product to treat hcv and hiv if we are unable to maintain or continue increasing sale of these product our result of operation may be adversely affected in july we received letter from the senate committee on finance requesting information and supporting documentation from related to sovaldi and the pricing of sovaldi in the united state the letter raised concern about our approach to pricing sovaldi it affordability and it impact on federal government spending and public health we are cooperating with the inquiry it is both costly and time consuming for to comply with these inquiry we can not predict the outcome it is possible that the inquiry could result in negative publicity or other negative action that could harm our reputation reduce demand for sovaldi harvoni or other sofosbuvir containing product and or reduce coverage of sovaldi harvoni or other sofosbuvir containing product including by federal health care program such medicare and medicaid if any or all of these event occur our business and stock price could be materially and adversely affected in country outside the united state the success of our commercialized product and any other product candidate we may develop will depend largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because in many country patient are unlikely to use prescription drug that are not reimbursed by their government in addition negotiating price with certain governmental authority can delay commercialization by month or more reimbursement policy may adversely affect our ability to sell our product on profitable basis in many international market government control the price of prescription pharmaceutical including through the implementation of reference pricing price cut rebate revenue related tax tender and profit control and they expect price of prescription pharmaceutical to decline over the life of the product or volume increase recently many country in the european union have increased the level of discounting required on our product and these effort could continue country attempt to manage healthcare expenditure especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crisis experienced by many country in the european union some country have instituted clawback and enacted tax on specific product generic drug come to market we may face price decrease for our product in some country in the european union further cost containment pressure in the european union especially in southern europe could lead to delay in the treatment of patient and also delay pricing approval which could negatively impact the commercialization of new product government agency also issue regulation and guideline directly applicable to and to our product in addition from time to time professional society practice management group private health science foundation and organization publish guideline or recommendation directed to certain health care and patient community such recommendation and guideline may relate to such matter product usage dosage route of administration and use of related or competing therapy and can consequently result in increased or decreased usage of our product approximately of our product sale occur outside the united state and currency fluctuation and hedging expense may cause our earnings to fluctuate which could adversely affect our stock price because significant percentage of our product sale are denominated in foreign currency primarily the euro we face exposure to adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens against these foreign currency the relative value of sale made in the respective foreign currency decrease conversely when the dollar weakens against these currency the relative value of such sale increase overall we are net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weaker dollar and are adversely affected by stronger dollar relative to those foreign currency in which we transact significant amount of business we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contract to hedge percentage of our forecasted international sale primarily those denominated in the euro we also hedge certain monetary asset and liability denominated in foreign which reduces but doe not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuation between the date transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid we can not predict future fluctuation in the foreign currency exchange rate of the dollar if the dollar appreciates significantly against certain currency and our hedging program doe not sufficiently offset the effect of such appreciation our result of operation will be adversely affected and our stock price may decline additionally the expense that we recognize in relation to our hedging activity can also cause our earnings to fluctuate the level of hedging expense that we recognize in particular period is impacted by the change in interest rate spread between the foreign currency that we hedge and the dollar we face significant competition we face significant competition from large global pharmaceutical and biotechnology company specialized pharmaceutical firm and generic drug manufacturer our hcv product sovaldi and harvoni compete with product marketed by abbvie inc abbvie and janssen ireland olysio simeprevir in the united state our hiv product compete primarily with product from viiv healthcare viiv which market fixed dose combination product that compete with stribild complera eviplera atripla and truvada for example lamivudine marketed by this joint venture competes with emtricitabine the active pharmaceutical ingredient of emtriva and component of complera eviplera atripla and truvada for tybost we compete with ritonavir marketed by abbvie in addition tivicay dolutegravir an integrase inhibitor launched in the fourth quarter of by viiv and triumeq single tablet triple combination antiretroviral regimen launched in the third quarter of by viiv could adversely impact sale of our hiv product we also face competition from generic hiv product in may the compound patent covering epivir lamivudine expired in the united state and generic lamivudine is now available in the united state spain portugal and italy we expect that generic version of lamivudine will be launched in other country within the european union in may generic version of combivir lamivudine and zidovudine wa approved and wa recently launched in the united state in addition in late generic tenofovir also became available in turkey which resulted in an increase in the rebate for viread in turkey generic version of sustiva efavirenz component of our atripla are now available in canada and europe and we anticipate competition from generic efavirenz to be in the united state in december we have observed some pricing pressure related to the sustiva component of our atripla sale for viread and hepsera for treatment of chronic hepatitis virus hbv infection we face competition from baraclude entecavir marketed by bristol myers squibb company well generic entecavir our hbv product also compete with tyzeka sebivo telbivudine marketed by novartis pharmaceutical corporation novartis ambisome competes predominantly with vfend voriconazole developed by pfizer and caspofungin product developed by merck that is marketed cancidas in the united state and caspofungin elsewhere in addition we are aware of at least three lipid formulation that claim similarity to ambisome becoming available outside of the united state including the possible entry of such formulation in taiwan these formulation may reduce market demand for ambisome furthermore the manufacture of lipid formulation of amphotericin is very complex and if any of these formulation are found to be unsafe sale of ambisome may be negatively impacted by association letairis competes directly with tracleer bosentan and opsumit macitentan produced by actelion pharmaceutical inc and also with adcirca tadalafil from united therapeutic corporation and pfizer ranexa competes predominantly with generic compound from three distinct class of drug beta blocker calcium channel blocker and long acting nitrate for the treatment of chronic angina in the united state cayston competes with tobi tobramycin inhalation solution marketed by novartis tamiflu competes with relenza zanamivir sold by gsk and product sold by generic competitor in relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia zydelig competes with imbruvica ibrutinib marketed by pharmacyclics inc in addition number of company are pursuing the development of technology which are competitive with our existing product or research program these competing company include specialized pharmaceutical firm and large pharmaceutical company acting either independently or together with other pharmaceutical company furthermore academic institution government agency and other public and private organization conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangement for competitive product or program if any of these competitor gain market share on our product it could adversely affect our result of operation and stock price significant safety issue arise for our marketed product or our product candidate our future sale may be reduced which would adversely affect our result of operation the data supporting the marketing approval for our product and forming the basis for the safety warning in our product label were obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration and in some case from post approval use our product are used over longer period of time by many patient with underlying health problem taking numerous other medicine we expect to continue to find new issue such safety resistance or drug interaction issue which may require to provide additional warning or contraindication on our label or narrow our approved indication each of which could reduce the market acceptance of these product our product letairis which wa approved by the food and drug administration fda in june is member of class of compound called endothelin receptor antagonist which pose specific risk including serious risk of birth defect because of these risk letairis is available only through the letairis education and access program leap restricted distribution program intended to help physician and patient learn about the risk associated with the product and assure appropriate use of the product the product is used by additional patient we may discover new risk associated with letairis which may result in change to the distribution program and additional restriction on the use of letairis which may decrease demand for the product regulatory authority have been moving towards more active and transparent pharmacovigilance and are making greater amount of stand alone safety information and clinical trial data directly available to the public through website and other mean periodic safety update report summary risk management plan summary and various adverse event data safety information without the appropriate context and expertise may be misinterpreted and lead to misperception or legal action which may potentially cause our product sale or stock price to decline further if serious safety resistance or drug interaction issue arise with our marketed product sale of these product could be limited or halted by or by regulatory authority and our result of operation would be adversely affected our operation depend on compliance with complex fda and comparable international regulation failure to obtain broad approval on timely basis or to maintain compliance could delay or halt commercialization of our product the product we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory authority and once approved are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the ema and comparable regulatory agency in other country we are continuing clinical trial for sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread emtriva hepsera tybost vitekta letairis ranexa cayston and zydelig for currently approved and additional us we anticipate that we will file for marketing approval in additional country and for additional indication and product over the next several year these product may fail to receive such marketing approval on timely basis or at all further our marketed product and how we manufacture and sell these product are subject to extensive regulation and review discovery of previously unknown problem with our marketed product or problem with our manufacturing or promotional activity may result in restriction on our product including withdrawal of the product from the market if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirement including those related to promotion and manufacturing we could be subject to penalty including fine suspension of regulatory approval product recall seizure of product and criminal prosecution for example under fda rule we are often required to conduct post approval clinical study to ass known serious risk signal of serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk and implement risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for our product which could include medication guide patient package insert communication plan to healthcare provider or other element the fda deems are necessary to assure safe use of the drug which could include imposing certain restriction on the distribution or use of product failure to comply with these or other requirement if imposed on sponsor by the fda could result in significant civil monetary penalty and our operating result may be adversely affected the result and anticipated timeline of our clinical trial are uncertain and may not support continued development of product candidate which would adversely affect our prospect for future revenue growth we are required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product that we develop for each intended use through extensive preclinical study and clinical trial the result from preclinical and early clinical study do not always accurately predict result in later large scale clinical trial even successfully completed large scale clinical trial may not result in marketable product if any of our product candidate fails to achieve it primary endpoint in clinical trial if safety issue arise or if the result from our clinical trial are otherwise inadequate to support regulatory approval of our product candidate commercialization of that product candidate could be delayed or halted for example we recently announced result from our study of simtuzumab for the treatment of pancreatic cancer myelofibrosis and colorectal cancer showing that the product candidate did not provide clinical benefit in addition we may also face challenge in clinical trial protocol design if the clinical trial for any of the product candidate in our pipeline are delayed or terminated our prospect for future revenue growth would be adversely impacted for example we face numerous risk and uncertainty with our product candidate including the fixed dose combination of sofosbuvir and for hcv the fixed dose combination of emtricitabine with taf for hiv idelalisib for the treatment of indolent non hodgkin lymphoma and frontline and relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia momelotinib for the treatment of myelofibrosis ranolazine for the treatment of incomplete revascularization post percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of lqt and taf standalone agent each currently in phase clinical trial that could prevent completion of development of these product candidate these risk include our ability to enroll patient in clinical trial the possibility of unfavorable result of our clinical trial the need to modify or delay our clinical trial or to perform additional trial and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approval result our product candidate may never be successfully commercialized further we may make strategic decision to discontinue development of our product candidate if for example we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunity in our pipeline if these program and others in our pipeline can not be completed on timely basis or at all then our prospect for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted in addition clinical trial involving our commercial product could raise new safety issue for our existing product which could in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business due to our reliance on third party contract research organization to conduct our clinical trial we are unable to directly control the timing conduct expense and quality of our clinical trial we extensively outsource our clinical trial activity and usually perform only small portion of the start up activity in house we rely on independent third party contract research organization cro to perform most of our clinical study including document preparation site identification screening and preparation pre study visit training program management and bioanalytical analysis many important aspect of the service performed for by the cro are out of our direct control if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cro our clinical trial may be delayed moreover in our regulatory submission we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party cro if any of our cro process methodology or result were determined to be invalid or inadequate our own clinical data and result and related regulatory approval could be adversely affected we depend on relationship with other company for sale and marketing performance development and commercialization of product candidate and revenue failure to maintain these relationship poor performance by these company or dispute with these company could negatively impact our business we rely on number of significant collaborative relationship with major pharmaceutical company for our sale and marketing performance in certain territory these include collaboration with bm for atripla in the united state europe and canada hoffmann la roche ltd together with hoffmann la roche inc roche for tamiflu worldwide and gsk for ambrisentan in territory outside of the united state in some country we rely on international distributor for sale of truvada viread hepsera emtriva and ambisome some of these relationship also involve the clinical development of these product by our partner reliance on collaborative relationship pose number of risk including the risk that we are unable to control the resource our corporate partner devote to our program or product dispute may arise with respect to the ownership of right to technology developed with our corporate partner disagreement with our corporate partner could cause delay in or termination of the research development or commercialization of product candidate or result in litigation or arbitration contract with our corporate partner may fail to provide significant protection or may fail to be effectively enforced if one of these partner fails to perform our corporate partner have considerable discretion in electing whether to pursue the development of any additional product and may pursue alternative technology or product either on their own or in collaboration with our competitor our corporate partner with marketing right may choose to pursue competing technology or to devote fewer resource to the marketing of our product than they do to product of their own development and our distributor and our corporate partner may be unable to pay particularly in light of current economic condition given these risk there is great deal of uncertainty regarding the success of our current and future collaborative effort if these effort fail our product development or commercialization of new product could be delayed or revenue from product could decline addition letairis and cayston are distributed through third party specialty pharmacy which are pharmacy specializing in the dispensing of medication for complex or chronic condition that may require high level of patient education and ongoing counseling the use of specialty pharmacy requires significant coordination with our sale and marketing medical affair regulatory affair legal and finance organization and involves risk including but not limited to risk that these specialty pharmacy will not provide with accurate or timely information regarding their inventory patient data or safety complaint not effectively sell or support letairis or cayston not devote the resource necessary to sell letairis or cayston in the volume and within the time frame that we expect not be able to satisfy their financial obligation to or others or cease operation we also rely on third party to administer leap the restricted distribution program designed to support letairis this third party provides information and education to prescribers and patient on the risk of letairis confirms insurance coverage and investigates alternative source of reimbursement or assistance ensures fulfillment of the risk management requirement mandated for letairis by the fda and coordinate and control dispensing to patient through the third party specialty pharmacy failure of this third party or the specialty pharmacy that distribute letairis to perform expected may result in regulatory action from the fda or decreased letairis sale either of which would harm our business further cayston may only be taken by patient using specific inhalation device that delivers the drug to the lung of patient our ongoing distribution of cayston is entirely reliant upon the manufacturer of that device this manufacturer could encounter other issue with regulatory agency related to the device or be unable to supply sufficient quantity of this device in addition the manufacturer may not be able to provide adequate warranty support for the device after it ha been distributed to patient with respect to distribution of the drug and device to patient we are reliant on the capability of specialty pharmacy for example the distribution channel for drug and device is complicated and requires coordination the reimbursement approval process associated with both drug and device are similarly complex if the device manufacturer is unable to obtain reimbursement approval or receives approval at lower than expected price sale of cayston may be adversely affected any of the previously described issue may limit the sale of cayston which would adversely affect our financial result our success will depend to significant degree on our ability to defend our patent and other intellectual property right both domestically and internationally we may not be able to obtain effective patent to protect our technology from use by competitor and patent of other company could require to stop using or pay for the use of required technology patent and other proprietary right are very important to our business our success will depend to significant degree on our ability to obtain patent and license to patent right preserve trade secret defend against infringement and effort to invalidate our patent and operate without infringing on the intellectual property of others if we have properly drafted and enforceable patent it can be more difficult for our competitor to use our technology to create competitive product and more difficult for our competitor to obtain patent that prevents from using technology we create part of our business strategy we actively seek patent protection both in the united state and internationally and file additional patent application when appropriate to cover improvement in our compound product and technology we have number of and foreign patent patent application and right to patent related to our compound product and technology but we can not be certain that issued patent will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent application will result in issued patent patent application are confidential for period of time before patent is issued result we may not know if our competitor filed patent application for technology covered by our pending application or if we were the first to invent or first to file an application directed toward the technology that is the subject of our patent application competitor may have filed patent application or received patent and may obtain additional patent and proprietary right that block or compete with our product in addition if competitor file patent application covering our technology we may have to participate in litigation interference or other proceeding to determine the right to patent litigation interference or other proceeding are unpredictable and expensive such that even if we are ultimately successful our result of operation may be adversely affected by such event do not cover the ranolazine compound the active ingredient of ranexa instead when it wa discovered that only sustained release formulation of ranolazine would achieve therapeutic plasma level patent were obtained on those formulation and the characteristic plasma level they achieve patent do not cover the active ingredient in ambisome in addition we do not have patent filing in china or certain other asian country covering all form of adefovir dipivoxil the active ingredient in hepsera asia is major market for therapy for hbv the indication for which hepsera ha been developed we may obtain patent for certain product many year before marketing approval is obtained for those product because patent have limited life which may begin to run prior to the commercial sale of the related product the commercial value of the patent may be limited however we may be able to apply for patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate in some country generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval to market generic version of our product through an abbreviated new drug application anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug see description of our anda litigation in legal proceeding beginning on page and risk factor entitled litigation with generic manufacturer ha increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and generic version of our product could be launched prior to our patent expiry beginning on page our success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patent or other proprietary right of third party if we infringe the valid patent of third party we may be prevented from commercializing product or may be required to obtain license from these third party we may not be able to obtain alternative technology or any required license on reasonable term or at all if we fail to obtain these license or alternative technology we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our product for example we are aware of patent that may relate to our operation of leap our restricted distribution program designed to support letairis and we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may claim to cover the use of sofosbuvir see description of our litigation regarding sofosbuvir in the risk factor entitled if any party is successful in establishing exclusive right to sovaldi and or harvoni our expected revenue and earnings from the sale of sovaldi and or harvoni could be adversely affected beginning on page furthermore we also rely on unpatented trade secret and improvement unpatented internal know how and technological innovation in particular great deal of our liposomal manufacturing expertise which is key component of our liposomal technology is not covered by patent but is instead protected trade secret we protect these right mainly through confidentiality agreement with our corporate partner employee consultant and vendor these agreement provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with will be kept confidential and will not be used or disclosed to third party except in specified circumstance in the case of employee the agreement provide that all invention made by an individual while employed by will be our exclusive property we can not be certain that these party will comply with these confidentiality agreement that we have adequate remedy for any breach or that our trade secret will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitor under some of our agreement invention become jointly owned by and our corporate partner and in other case become the exclusive property of one party in certain circumstance it can be difficult to determine who owns particular invention and dispute could arise regarding those invention if our trade secret or confidential information become known or independently discovered by competitor or if we enter into dispute over ownership of invention our business and result of operation could be adversely affected if any party is successful in establishing exclusive right to sovaldi and or harvoni our expected revenue and earnings from the sale of sovaldi and or harvoni could be adversely affected we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing sovaldi or harvoni for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may be alleged by such party to cover the use of sovaldi and harvoni we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to sovaldi or harvoni and we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending against these claim if these party successfully obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by sovaldi and or harvoni we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain license under such patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all proceeding and litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc idenix in february we received notice that the patent and trademark office uspto had declared interference no first idenix interference between our patent no the patent and idenix pending patent application no an interference is an administrative proceeding before the uspto designed to determine who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both party our patent cover metabolite of sofosbuvir idenix is attempting to patent class of compound including these metabolite the purpose of the first idenix interference wa to determine who wa first to invent these compound and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compound in march the uspto patent trial and appeal board the board determined that idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of it early application filing date because none of those patent application including the application granted idenix patent no the patent taught how to make the compound in dispute the board also determined that because we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application we were first to file the patent application on the compound in dispute and we were therefore the senior party in the first idenix interference on january the board determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the compound in dispute and accordingly gilead prevailed in the first idenix interference in it decision the board held that idenix failed to prove that it wa first to conceive of any of the compound in dispute specifically idenix failed to prove that the idenix inventor had identified the structure method of making and use for any of the disputed compound the board went on to conclude that idenix failed to work diligently toward making and testing the compound in dispute during the relevant time period idenix ha appealed the board decision to the district court for the district of delaware in december after receiving our request to do so the uspto declared interference no second idenix interference between our pending patent application no and the patent the patent includes claim directed to method of treating hcv with nucleoside compound similar to those which were involved in the first idenix interference the second idenix interference will determine who wa first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv on january the board issued decision in favor of gilead in the first phase of the second idenix interference the board decided that we were first to file the patent application on the disputed method of treating hcv designated gilead the senior party in the second idenix interference and invalidated the patent claim of the idenix patent that are involved in the second idenix interference the senior party we are presumed to be the first to have invented the disputed method of treating hcv because idenix failed to teach how to make and use the invention in it patent the board invalidated the idenix claim involved in the second idenix interference for lack of enablement the board ha also placed idenix under an order to show cause requiring idenix to explain why judgment should not be entered against it in the second idenix interference based upon the decision by the board in the first idenix interference the decision in the second idenix interference is consistent with the board earlier ruling in march and january in the first idenix interference in which gilead wa declared the senior party and the first to invent certain fluoro methyl nucleoside compound these compound are relevant to the method of treating hcv at issue in the second idenix interference we believe that the idenix claim involved in the first and second idenix interference and similar and foreign patent claiming the same compound metabolite and us thereof are invalid result we filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada to invalidate idenix canadian patent no the patent which is the canadian patent that corresponds to the patent and the idenix patent application that wa the subject of the first idenix interference idenix ha asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in canada will infringe it patent and that our canadian patent no corresponding to the patent involved in the first idenix interference is invalid trial on these issue commenced in january we filed similar legal action in norway in the oslo district court seeking to invalidate idenix norwegian patent corresponding to the patent in september idenix filed an invalidation action in the norwegian proceeding against our norwegian patent no patent which corresponds to the patent on march the norwegian court found all claim in the idenix norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claim in the challenged gilead patent on april idenix appealed the march decision to the norwegian court of appeal idenix obligation to pay our attorney fee will be stayed during the pendency of the appeal the appeal from the march decision is scheduled to commence in february in august and april idenix filed two separate request for invalidation with the chinese patent office of our chinese patent cn which corresponds to our patent in august idenix withdrew it invalidation request and the chinese proceeding were terminated with our challenged patent remaining valid and enforceable in january we filed legal action in the federal court of australia seeking to invalidate idenix australian patent corresponding to the patent in april idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in australia will infringe the australian patent corresponding to the patent trial on these issue is scheduled to commence in september in sydney on march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent also on that day idenix initiated infringement proceeding against gilead in the united kingdom uk germany and france alleging that the commercialization of sovaldi in those country would infringe the respective national counterpart of the patent in the united kingdom trial wa held in october to determine the issue of infringement and validity of the idenix uk patent in december the high court of justice of england and wale uk court invalidated all claim of the patent on multiple ground specifically the uk court held that the patent lacked novelty over our earlier filed patent application teaching some of the same compound the patent lacked an inventive step because it did not add anything to the knowledge existing at the time and the disclosure in the idenix patent application wa insufficient because it did not teach how to make the compound or show which of the claimed compound would have activity against virus like the hepatitis virus on january the uk court held hearing at which the court ordered idenix to pay of gilead cost with an interim payment due within day of the hearing the uk court granted idenix permission to appeal the december judgment on february the german court in düsseldorf held hearing to determine the issue of infringement of the idenix german patent we do not have trial date for the french lawsuit idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent issue we expect to challenge them in proceeding similar to those we invoked in other country in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no and on june the court in massachusetts granted our request and transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware we believe that idenix patent are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir the district court ha set trial date in october and december for resolution of these issue decision by the district court can be appealed by either party to the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc idenix wa acquired by merck in august while the acquisition doe not change our view of the lack of merit in the claim made by idenix merck ha greater resource than idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher level than idenix litigation with merck in august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no and which it co owns with isi pharmaceutical inc we believe that merck patent are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir accordingly in august we filed lawsuit in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed merck patent no and cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir and ultimately extract royalty payment for sofosbuvir commercialization or to exclude it from the market if the court determines that merck patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to merck to commercialize sofosbuvir either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the court ha set trial date of march for this litigation litigation with abbvieabbvie ha obtained patent no and abbvie patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir or harvoni for the treatment of hcv we are aware that abbvie ha pending patent application in other country we own published and pending patent application directed to the use of combination for the treatment of hcv and specifically to the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir certain of those application were filed before the abbvie patent for this reason and others we believe the abbvie patent are invalid accordingly in december we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the abbvie patent are invalid and unenforceable well other relief we believe that abbott laboratory inc and abbvie conspired to eliminate competition in the hcv market by falsely representing to the uspto that they and not gilead invented method of treating hcv using combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir in february and march abbvie responded to our lawsuit by filing two lawsuit also in the district court for the district of alleging that our fixed dose combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir will infringe it patent all of those lawsuit have been consolidated into single action either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the abbvie patent have not blocked or delayed the commercialization of our combination product in the united state and we do not expect any other foreign patent to block or delay the commercialization around the world if court determines that the abbvie patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to abbvie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination product manufacturing problem including at our third party manufacturer and corporate partner could cause inventory shortage and delay product shipment and regulatory approval which may adversely affect our result of operation in order to generate revenue from our product we must be able to produce sufficient quantity of our product to satisfy demand many of our product are the result of complex manufacturing process the manufacturing process for pharmaceutical product is also highly regulated and regulator may shut down manufacturing facility that they believe do not comply with regulation our product are either manufactured at our own facility or by third party manufacturer or corporate partner we depend on third party to perform manufacturing activity effectively and on timely basis for the majority of our solid dose product in addition roche either by itself or through third party is responsible for manufacturing tamiflu we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner are subject to good manufacturing practice gmp which are extensive regulation governing manufacturing process stability testing record keeping and quality standard defined by the fda and the ema similar regulation are in effect in other country our third party manufacturer and corporate partner are independent entity who are subject to their own unique operational and financial risk which are out of our control if we or any of these third party manufacturer or corporate partner fail to perform required this could impair our ability to deliver our product on timely basis or receive royalty or cause delay in our clinical trial and application for regulatory approval further we may have to write off the cost of manufacturing any batch that fails to pas quality inspection or meet regulatory approval to the extent these risk materialize and affect their performance obligation to our financial result may be adversely affected in addition we our third party manufacturer and our corporate partner may only be able to produce some of our product at one or limited number of facility and therefore have limited manufacturing capacity for certain product for example in due to unexpected delay both in qualifying two new external site and with expanding cayston manufacturing in san dimas we were unable to supply enough cayston to fulfill our projected demand from february through september we suspended access for patient with new prescription for cayston subject to certain exception where specific medical need existed result of our inability to manufacture sufficient cayston to meet demand the amount of revenue we received from the sale of cayston wa reduced our manufacturing operation are subject to routine inspection by regulatory agency for example in april the fda conducted an inspection of our foster city facility and issued form inspectional observation which noted deficiency in documentation and validation of certain quality testing procedure and method result of the observation the fda delivered complete response letter notifying that it wa unable to approve our ndas for elvitegravir and cobicistat standalone agent in mid october the fda completed it sofosbuvir pre approval inspection of our foster city facility following that inspection the fda issued additional form inspectional observation citing deficiency related to testing and reconciliation of stability sample testing protocol testing of shipping sample and procedure for calibrating test equipment we completed and filed our response to these observation with the fda in we received letter from fda related to the extent of method revalidations being conducted stability program oversight audit trail review data management and quality management system gap we have filed our response to these observation with the fda if we are unable to remedy the deficiency cited by the fda in these inspection our currently marketed product and the timing of regulatory approval of product in development could be adversely affected further there is risk that regulatory agency in other country where marketing application are pending will undertake similar additional review or apply heightened standard of review which could delay the regulatory approval for product in those country if approval of any of our product candidate were delayed or if production of our marketed product wa interrupted our anticipated revenue and our stock price would be adversely affected we may not be able to obtain material or supply necessary to conduct clinical trial or to manufacture and sell our product which would limit our ability to generate revenue we need access to certain supply and product to conduct our clinical trial and to manufacture our product if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantity of these material or find suitable alternate material in timely manner our development effort for our product candidate may be delayed or our ability to manufacture our product would be limited which would limit our ability to generate revenue of key component and material must be named in an nda filed with the fda ema or other regulatory authority for any product candidate for which we are seeking marketing approval and significant delay can occur if the qualification of new supplier is required even after manufacturer is qualified by the regulatory authority the manufacturer must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure full compliance with gmp manufacturer are subject to regular periodic inspection by the regulatory authority following initial approval if result of these inspection regulatory authority determines that the equipment facility laboratory or process do not comply with applicable regulation and condition of product approval the regulatory authority may suspend the manufacturing operation if the manufacturing operation of any of the single supplier for our product are suspended we may be unable to generate sufficient quantity of commercial or clinical supply of product to meet market demand which would in turn decrease our revenue and harm our business in addition if delivery of material from our supplier were interrupted for any reason we may be unable to ship certain of our product for commercial supply or to supply our product in development for clinical trial in addition some of our product and the material that we utilize in our operation are made at only one facility for example we manufacture certain drug product intermediate utilized in ambisome exclusively at our facility in san dimas california in the event of disaster including an earthquake equipment failure or other difficulty we may be unable to replace this manufacturing capacity in timely manner and may be unable to manufacture ambisome to meet market need in addition we depend on single supplier for high quality cholesterol and active pharmaceutical ingredient which is used in the manufacture of ambisome we also rely on single source for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of zydelig letairis astellas llc which market lexiscan in the united state is responsible for the commercial manufacture and supply of product in the united state and is dependent on single supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient of lexiscan problem with any of the single supplier we depend on may negatively impact our development and commercialization effort significant portion of the raw material and intermediate used to manufacture our antiviral product sovaldi atripla truvada harvoni complera eviplera stribild viread emtriva and tybost are supplied by china based company result an international trade dispute between china and the united state or any other action by the chinese government that would limit or prevent chinese company from supplying these material would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our antiviral product to meet market need and have material and adverse effect on our operating result litigation with generic manufacturer ha increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings if we are unsuccessful in all or some of these lawsuit some or all of our claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and generic version of our product could be launched prior to our patent expiry part of the approval process for some of our product the fda granted new chemical entity nce exclusivity period during which other manufacturer application for approval of generic version of our product will not be approved generic manufacturer may challenge the patent protecting product that have been granted nce exclusivity one year prior to the end of the nce exclusivity period generic manufacturer have sought and may continue to seek fda approval for similar or identical drug through an anda the application form typically used by manufacturer seeking approval of generic drug current legal proceeding of significance with some of our generic manufacturer include mylanin april we received notice that mylan inc mylan submitted an anda to the fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of truvada in the notice mylan alleges that two of the patent associated with emtricitabine and one of our patent associated with the fixed dose combination of emtricitabine with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by mylan manufacture use or sale of generic version of truvada in june we filed lawsuit against mylan in district court for the northern district of west virginia for infringement of our patent in june we received notice that mylan inc submitted petition for inter partes review ipr to the board alleging that four patent associated with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate are invalid we opposed mylan petition in december the ptab issued decision denying each of mylan petition for ipr against the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate associated patent on the ground that mylan had not established reasonable likelihood of success that it would prevail in it challenge to each of these patent mylan ha requested rehearing on the basis that it belief the ptab decision is wrong apotexin june we received notice that apotex inc apotex submitted an abbreviated new drug submission ands to the canadian minister of health requesting permission to manufacture and market generic fixed dose combination of emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and separate ands requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of viread in the notice apotex alleges that three of the patent associated with truvada and two of the patent with viread are invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by apotex manufacture use or sale of generic version of truvada or viread in august we filed lawsuit against apotex in the federal court of canada seeking an order of prohibition against approval of this ands natcoin march we and hoffmann la roche ltd roche filed lawsuit against natco pharma ltd natco in district court for the district of new jersey for infringement of one of the patent associated with tamiflu in december the court issued ruling in favor of gilead and roche that our patent is not invalid for the reason stated in natco notice letter natco ha appealed this decision to the cafc in april the cafc issued decision which will allow natco patent invalidity challenge to proceed if the case is remanded to the district court for full trial on the merit on june we filed petition for rehearing en banc with the cafc which wa subsequently denied we have submitted request for an extension of time to submit our petition for certiorari to the supreme court of the united state and are concurrently proceeding before the district court tevain august teva pharmaceutical teva filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada seeking invalidation of our two canadian patent associated with viread in september hearing on the consolidated request for order of prohibition in connection with all three of teva ands filing to the canadian minister of health for teva generic version of viread truvada and atripla took place in december the court issued our requested order prohibiting the canadian ministry of health from issuing notice of compliance for teva generic version of our viread truvada and atripla product until expiry of our patent in july teva appealed the decision of the court prohibiting the minister of heath from issuing the notice of compliance until expiry of our patent in july this decision did not rule on the validity of the patent and accordingly the only issue on appeal is whether the minister of health should be prohibited from issuing the notice of compliance for teva product separately the court will determine the validity of the patent in the pending impeachment action trial in the impeachment action is scheduled for september if teva is successful in invalidating our patent teva may be able to launch generic version of our viread truvada and atripla product in canada prior to the expiry of our patent watsonin february we received notice that watson laboratory inc watson submitted an anda to the fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of letairis in the notice watson alleges that one of the patent associated with ambrisentan tablet is invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by watson manufacture use or sale of generic version of letairis we are currently evaluating watson notice and will file patent infringement lawsuit necessary to protect the exclusivity of the product astellas apotexin december astellas informed that they had received notice that apotex submitted an anda to the fda requesting permission to manufacture and market generic version of lexiscan in the notice apotex alleges that one of the patent associated with regadenoson is invalid unenforceable and or will not be infringed by apotex manufacture use or sale of generic version of lexiscan because apotex ha not challenged several of the patent associated with regadenoson apotex product would not be eligible for final approval until expiry of the patent that have not been challenged we and astellas have the opportunity to file patent infringement lawsuit against apotex in the future should we decide that it is necessary to protect the exclusivity of the product we can not predict the ultimate outcome of the foregoing action and other litigation with generic manufacturer and we may spend significant resource enforcing and defending these patent if we are unsuccessful in these lawsuit some or all of our original claim in the patent may be narrowed or invalidated and the patent protection for truvada viread and tamiflu in the united state and atripla truvada and viread in canada could be substantially shortened further if all of the patent covering one or more product are invalidated the fda or canadian minister of health could approve the request to manufacture generic version of such product in the united state or canada respectively prior to the expiration date of those patent the sale of generic version of these product earlier than their patent expiration would have significant negative effect on our revenue and result of operation we face credit risk from our emerging market and southern european customer that may adversely affect our result of operation we have exposure to customer credit risk in emerging market and southern europe southern european product sale to government owned or supported customer in southern europe specifically spain italy portugal and greece have been and continue to be subject to significant payment delay due to government funding and reimbursement practice this ha resulted and may continue to result in day sale outstanding being significantly higher in these country due to the average length of time that account receivable remain outstanding of december our account receivable in these country totaled approximately million of which million were past due greater than day and million were past due greater than day historically receivable balance with certain publicly owned hospital accumulate over period of time and are then subsequently settled large lump sum payment this pattern is also experienced by other pharmaceutical company that sell directly to hospital if significant change were to occur in the reimbursement practice of these european government or if government funding becomes unavailable we may not be able to collect on amount due to from these customer and our result of operation would be adversely affected our revenue and gross margin could be reduced by import from country where our product are available at lower price price for our product are based on local market economics and competition and sometimes differ from country to country our sale in country with relatively higher price may be reduced if product can be imported into those or other country from lower price market there have been case in which other pharmaceutical product were sold at steeply discounted price in the developing world and then exported to european country where they could be re sold at much higher price if this happens with our product particularly truvada and viread which we have agreed to make available at substantially reduced price to more than country participating in our gilead access program or atripla which merck distributes at substantially reduced price to hiv infected patient in developing country under our agreement our revenue would be adversely affected in addition we have established partnership with india based generic manufacturer to distribute generic version of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate to developing world country including india we expanded these agreement to include right to stribild tybost and vitekta we also entered into agreement with certain india based generic manufacturer to produce and distribute generic emtricitabine in the developing world including single tablet regimen containing emtricitabine and fixed dose combination of emtricitabine co formulated with our other hiv medicine in september we entered into licensing agreement with india based generic manufacturer to produce and distribute generic sofosbuvir and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir to developing country if generic version of our hiv and hcv medication under these license are then re exported to the united state europe or other market outside of these country our revenue would be adversely affected part of our commitment to make sovaldi available in the developing world at discounted price we entered into an agreement to make sovaldi available in egypt country that ha among the highest hcv prevalence in the world if the discounted sovaldi is re exported from these developing country into the united state or other higher price market our revenue could be adversely affected in addition purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high may adversely impact our revenue and gross margin and may cause our sale to fluctuate from quarter to quarter for example in the european union we are required to permit product purchased in one country to be sold in another country purchase of our product in country where our selling price are relatively low for resale in country in which our selling price are relatively high can affect the inventory level held by our wholesaler and can cause the relative sale level in the various country to fluctuate from quarter to quarter and not reflect the actual consumer demand in any given quarter these quarterly fluctuation may impact our earnings which could adversely affect our stock price and harm our business expensive litigation and government investigation have increased our expense which may continue to reduce our earnings we are involved in number of litigation investigation and other dispute related matter that require to expend substantial internal and financial resource we expect these matter will continue to require high level of internal and financial resource for the foreseeable future these matter have reduced and will continue to reduce our earnings please see description of our litigation regarding sofosbuvir and litigation with generic manufacturer in legal proceeding beginning on page the outcome of such lawsuit or any other lawsuit that may be brought against the investigation or any other investigation that may be initiated are inherently uncertain and adverse development or outcome can result in significant expense monetary damage penalty or injunctive relief against that could significantly reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in some country we may be required to grant compulsory license for our product or our patent may not be enforced in number of developing country government official and other interested group have suggested that pharmaceutical company should make drug for hcv or hiv infection available at low cost alternatively government in developing country could require that we grant compulsory license to allow competitor to manufacture and sell their own version of our product thereby reducing our product sale for example there is growing attention on the availability of hcv therapy and some activist are advocating for the increased availability of hcv therapy through mean including compulsory license in the past certain office of the government of brazil have expressed concern over the affordability of our hiv product and declared that they were considering issuing compulsory license to permit the manufacture of otherwise patented product for hiv infection including viread in addition concern over the cost and availability of tamiflu related to potential avian flu pandemic and influenza generated international discussion over compulsory licensing of our tamiflu patent for example the canadian government considered allowing canadian manufacturer to manufacture and export the active ingredient in tamiflu to eligible developing and least developed country under canada access to medicine regime furthermore roche issued voluntary license to permit third party manufacturing of tamiflu for example roche granted sublicense to shanghai pharmaceutical group co ltd for china and sublicense to india hetero drug limited for india and certain developing country if compulsory license permit generic manufacturing to override our product patent for sovaldi harvoni our hiv product or tamiflu or if we are required to grant compulsory license for these product it could reduce our earnings and cash flow and harm our business in addition certain country do not permit enforcement of our patent and third party manufacturer are able to sell generic version of our product in those country for example in july the brazilian patent authority rejected our patent application for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate the active pharmaceutical ingredient in viread this wa the highest level of appeal available to within the brazilian patent authority because we do not currently have patent in brazil the brazilian government now purchase it supply of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate from generic manufacturer sale of generic version of our product could significantly reduce our sale and adversely affect our result of operation particularly if generic version of our product are imported into territory where we have existing commercial sale we may face significant liability resulting from our product that may not be covered by insurance and successful claim could materially reduce our earnings the testing manufacturing marketing and use of our commercial product well product candidate in development involve substantial risk of product liability claim these claim may be made directly by consumer healthcare provider pharmaceutical company or others in recent year coverage and availability of cost effective product liability insurance ha decreased so we may be unable to maintain sufficient coverage for product liability that may arise in addition the cost to defend lawsuit or pay damage for product liability claim may exceed our coverage if we are unable to maintain adequate coverage or if claim exceed our coverage our financial condition and our ability to clinically test our product candidate and market our product will be adversely affected in addition negative publicity associated with any claim regardless of their merit may decrease the future demand for our product and impair our financial condition business disruption from natural or man made disaster may harm our future revenue our worldwide operation could be subject to business interruption stemming from natural or man made disaster for which we may be self insured our corporate headquarters and fremont location which together house majority of our activity and our san dimas and oceanside manufacturing facility are located in california seismically active region we do not carry earthquake insurance and significant recovery time could be required to resume operation our financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected in the event of major earthquake we are dependent on information technology system infrastructure and data we are dependent upon information technology system infrastructure and data the multitude and complexity of our computer system make them inherently vulnerable to service interruption or destruction malicious intrusion and random attack likewise data privacy or security breach by employee or others may pose risk that sensitive data including our intellectual property trade secret or personal information of our employee patient customer or other business partner may be exposed to unauthorized person or to the public cyberattacks are increasing in their frequency sophistication and intensity cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware denial of service social engineering and other mean to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability our business partner face similar risk and any security breach of their system could adversely affect our security posture while we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure there can be no assurance that our effort will prevent service interruption or identify breach in our system that could adversely affect our business and operation and or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information which could result in financial legal business or reputational harm to in addition our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover against claim related to security breach cyberattacks and other related breach in our effective income tax rate could reduce our earnings we are subject to income tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction including ireland due to economic and political condition various country are actively considering change to existing tax law we can not predict the form or timing of potential legislative change that could have material adverse impact on our result of operation in addition significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax various factor may have favorable or unfavorable effect on our income tax rate including but not limited to change in forecasted demand for our hcv product our portion of the non tax deductible bpd fee also known the pharmaceutical excise tax the accounting for stock option and other share based award merger and acquisition the ability to manufacture product in our cork ireland facility the amortization of certain acquisition related intangible for which we receive no tax benefit expiration of the federal research tax credit future level of spending change in the mix of earnings in the various tax jurisdiction in which we operate change in overall level of pre tax earnings and resolution of federal state and foreign income tax audit the impact on our income tax provision resulting from the above mentioned factor may be significant and could have negative impact on our consolidated result of operation our income tax return are audited by federal state and foreign tax authority we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the and tax year and by various state and foreign jurisdiction there are differing interpretation of tax law and regulation and result significant dispute may arise with these tax authority involving issue of the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction resolution of one or more of these exposure in any reporting period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period if we fail to attract and retain highly qualified personnel we may be unable to successfully develop new product candidate conduct our clinical trial and commercialize our product candidate our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific technical and management personnel well personnel with expertise in clinical testing governmental regulation and commercialization we face competition for personnel from other company university public and private research institution government entity and other organization competition for qualified personnel in the biopharmaceutical field is intense and there is limited pool of qualified potential employee to recruit we may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable term if we are unsuccessful in our recruitment and retention effort our business may be harmed there can be no assurance that we will pay dividend or continue to repurchase stock in february we announced that our board of director authorized dividend program under which we intend to pay quarterly dividend of per share beginning in the second quarter of subject to quarterly declaration by our board of director and that our board of director also approved the repurchase of up to an additional billion of our common stock the declaration amount and timing of such dividend and or the amount and timing of such stock repurchase are subject to capital availability and determination by our board of director that cash dividend and or stock repurchase are in the best interest of our stockholder and are in compliance with all respective law and our agreement applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividend and the repurchase of stock our ability to pay dividend and or repurchase stock will depend upon among other factor our cash balance and potential future capital requirement for strategic transaction including acquisition debt service requirement result of operation financial condition and other factor beyond our control that our board of director may deem relevant reduction in or elimination of our dividend payment our dividend program and or stock repurchase could have negative effect on our stock price item unresolved staff comment not applicable item property our corporate headquarters is located in foster city california where we house our administrative manufacturing and activity we also have facility

proceeding litigation regarding sofosbuvirin january we acquired pharmasset inc pharmasset through the acquisition we acquired sofosbuvir nucleotide analog that act to inhibit the replication of the hcv in december we received fda approval of sofosbuvir now known commercially sovaldi in october we also received approval of the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir now known commercially harvoni we have received number of contractual and intellectual property claim regarding sofosbuvir we have carefully considered these claim both prior to and following the acquisition and believe they are without merit we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing sovaldi or harvoni for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may be alleged by such party to cover the use of sovaldi and harvoni we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to sovaldi or harvoni and we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending against these claim if these party successfully obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by sovaldi and or harvoni we could be prevented from selling these product unless we were able to obtain license under such patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all interference proceeding and litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc idenix in february we received notice that the patent and trademark office uspto had declared interference no first idenix interference between our patent no the patent and idenix pending patent application no an interference is an administrative proceeding before the uspto designed to determine who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both party our patent cover metabolite of sofosbuvir idenix is attempting to patent class of compound including these metabolite the purpose of the first idenix interference wa to determine who wa first to invent these compound and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compound in march the uspto patent trial and appeal board the board determined that idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of it early application filing date because none of those patent application including the application granted idenix patent no the patent taught how to make the compound in dispute the board also determined that because we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application we were first to file the patent application on the compound in dispute and we were therefore the senior party in the first idenix interference on january the board determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the compound in dispute and accordingly gilead prevailed in the first idenix interference in it decision the board held that idenix failed to prove that it wa first to conceive of any of the compound in dispute specifically idenix failed to prove that the idenix inventor had identified the structure method of making and use for any of the disputed compound the board went on to conclude that idenix failed to work diligently toward making and testing the compound in dispute during the relevant time period idenix ha appealed the board decision to the district court for the district of delaware in december after receiving our request to do so the uspto declared interference no second idenix interference between our pending patent application no and the patent the patent includes claim directed to method of treating hcv with nucleoside compound similar to those which were involved in the first idenix interference the second idenix interference will determine who wa first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv on january the board issued decision in favor of gilead in the first phase of the second idenix interference the board decided that we were first to file the patent application on the disputed method of treating hcv designated gilead the senior party in the second idenix interference and invalidated the patent claim of the idenix patent that are involved in the second idenix interference the senior party we are presumed to be the first to have invented the disputed method of treating hcv because idenix failed to teach how to make and use the invention in it patent the board invalidated the idenix claim involved in the second idenix interference for lack of enablement the board ha also placed idenix under an order to show cause requiring idenix to explain why judgment should not be entered against it in the second idenix interference based upon the decision by the board in the first idenix interference the decision in the second idenix interference is consistent with the board earlier ruling in march and january in the first idenix interference in which gilead wa declared the senior party and the first to invent certain fluoro methyl nucleoside compound these compound are relevant to the method of treating hcv at issue in the second idenix interference we believe that the idenix claim involved in the first and second idenix interference and similar and foreign patent claiming the same compound metabolite and us thereof are invalid result we filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada to invalidate idenix canadian patent no the patent which is the canadian that corresponds to the patent and the idenix patent application that wa the subject of the first idenix interference idenix ha asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in canada will infringe it patent and that our canadian patent no corresponding to the patent involved in the first idenix interference is invalid trial on these issue commenced in january we filed similar legal action in norway in the oslo district court seeking to invalidate idenix norwegian patent corresponding to the patent in september idenix filed an invalidation action in the norwegian proceeding against our norwegian patent no patent which corresponds to the patent on march the norwegian court found all claim in the idenix norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claim in the challenged gilead patent on april idenix appealed the march decision to the norwegian court of appeal idenix obligation to pay our attorney fee will be stayed during the pendency of the appeal the appeal from the march decision is scheduled to commence in february in august and april idenix filed two separate request for invalidation with the chinese patent office of our chinese patent cn which corresponds to our patent in august idenix withdrew it invalidation request and the chinese proceeding were terminated with our challenged patent remaining valid and enforceable in january we filed legal action in the federal court of australia seeking to invalidate idenix australian patent corresponding to the patent in april idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in australia will infringe the australian patent corresponding to the patent trial on these issue is scheduled to commence in september in sydney on march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent also on that day idenix initiated infringement proceeding against gilead in the united kingdom uk germany and france alleging that the commercialization of sovaldi in those country would infringe the respective national counterpart of the patent in the united kingdom trial wa held in october to determine the issue of infringement and validity of the idenix uk patent in december the high court of justice of england and wale uk court invalidated all claim of the patent on multiple ground specifically the uk court held that the patent lacked novelty over our earlier filed patent application teaching some of the same compound the patent lacked an inventive step because it did not add anything to the knowledge existing at the time and the disclosure in the idenix patent application wa insufficient because it did not teach how to make the compound or show which of the claimed compound would have activity against virus like the hepatitis virus on january the uk court held hearing at which the court ordered idenix to pay of gilead cost with an interim payment due within day of the hearing the uk court granted idenix permission to appeal the december judgment on february the german court in düsseldorf held hearing to determine the issue of infringement of the idenix german patent we do not have trial date for the french lawsuit idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent issue we expect to challenge them in proceeding similar to those we invoked in other country in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no and on june the court in massachusetts granted our request and transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware we believe that idenix patent are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir the district court ha set trial date in october and december for resolution of these issue decision by the district court can be appealed by either party to the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc idenix wa acquired by merck in august while the acquisition doe not change our view of the lack of merit in the claim made by idenix merck ha greater resource than idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher level than idenix litigation with merck co inc merck in august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no and which it co owns with isi pharmaceutical inc we believe that merck patent are invalid and are not infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize in august we filed lawsuit in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed merck patent no and cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir with the apparent goal of ultimately extracting royalty payment for sofosbuvir commercialization or eliminating competition by excluding it from the market if the court determines that merck patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to merck to commercialize sofosbuvir either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the court ha set trial date of march for this lawsuit litigation with abbvie inc abbvie abbvie ha obtained patent no and abbvie patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir or harvoni for the treatment of hcv gilead is aware that abbvie ha pending patent application in the united state and other country we own published and pending patent application directed to the use of combination for the treatment of hcv and specifically to the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir certain of our application were filed before the abbvie patent for this reason and others we believe the abbvie patent are invalid accordingly in december we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the abbvie patent are invalid and unenforceable well other relief we believe that abbott laboratory inc and abbvie conspired to eliminate competition in the hcv market by falsely representing to the uspto that they and not gilead invented method of treating hcv using combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir in february and march abbvie responded to our lawsuit by filing two lawsuit also in the district court for the district of delaware alleging that our fixed dose combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir will infringe it patent all of those lawsuit have been consolidated into single action in the united state either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the abbvie patent have not blocked or delayed the commercialization of our combination product in the united state or europe we do not expect any other foreign patent to block or delay the commercialization around the world if court determines that the abbvie patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to abbvie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination product litigation with generic manufacturer part of the approval process for some of our product the fda granted new

manufacturing capability or office facility the possibility of acquiring other company or new product cost associated with the settlement and conversion of our convertible senior note and related warrant the establishment of additional collaborative relationship with other company and cost associated with the defense settlement and adverse result of litigation and government investigation we may in the future require additional funding which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financing if such funding is required we can not guarantee that it will be available to on favorable term if at all accounting policy estimate and judgment the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition allowance for doubtful account valuation of intangible asset and contingent consideration liability resulting from business combination and our tax provision we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other market specific and other relevant assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ significantly from these estimate we believe the following critical accounting policy reflect the more significant judgment and estimate used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement revenue recognition product sale we recognize revenue from product sale when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured we record product sale net of estimated mandatory and supplemental discount to government payer in addition to discount to private payer and other related charge these are generally referred to gross to net deduction and are recorded in the same period the related sale occur government and other rebate and chargebacks represent the majority of our gross to net deduction and require complex and significant judgment by management estimate are assessed each period and updated to reflect current information government and other rebate and chargebacksgovernment and other rebate and chargebacks include amount paid to payer and healthcare provider in the united state including medicaid rebate adaps veteran administration and public health service discount and other rebate well foreign government rebate rebate and chargebacks are based on contractual arrangement or statutory requirement which may vary by product by payer and individual payer plan for qualified program that can purchase our product through wholesaler or other distributor at lower contractual price the wholesaler or distributor charge back to the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contractual price our consolidated allowance for government and other chargebacks that are payable to our direct customer are classified reduction of account receivable and totaled million of december and million of december our consolidated allowance for government and other rebate that will be paid to party other than our direct customer are recorded in accrued government and other rebate on our consolidated balance sheet and totaled billion of december and billion of december our allowance for government and other rebate and chargebacks are estimated based on product sold historical utilization rate pertinent third party industry information estimated patient population known market event or trend channel inventory and or other market data we also take into consideration new information regarding change in program regulation and guideline that would impact the amount of the actual rebate and or our expectation regarding future utilization rate for these program we believe that the methodology that we use to estimate our government and other rebate and chargebacks is reasonable and appropriate given the current fact and circumstance however actual result may differ significantly from our estimate during the last three year our actual government rebate and chargebacks claimed for prior period have varied by le than from our estimate following table summarizes the consolidated activity in our government and other rebate and chargebacks account in million accrued government and other rebate and chargebacks balance atbeginningof year decrease increase to product sale payment balance atend ofyearyear ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to ended december activity related to sale related to sale prior to for doubtful account we maintain an allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment this allowance is based on our analysis of several factor including but not limited to contractual payment term historical payment pattern of our customer and individual customer circumstance an analysis of day sale outstanding by geographic region and review of the local economic environment and it potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practice if the financial condition of our customer or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate resulting in an inability to make payment additional allowance may be required we believe that the allowance for doubtful account is adequate however significant deterioration in any of the above factor could materially change these expectation and may result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful account of december and our allowance for doubtful account wa million and million respectively valuation of intangible assetsin conjunction with our business combination we have recorded intangible asset primarily related to ipr project we had total intangible asset of billion of december and billion of december the identifiable intangible asset are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date the model used in valuing these intangible asset require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to estimate of revenue and operating profit related to the product or product candidate the probability of success for unapproved product candidate considering their stage of development the time and resource needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risk including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in developing product candidate such obtaining fda and other regulatory approval and risk related to the viability of and potential alternative treatment in any future target market we believe the fair value used to record intangible asset acquired in connection with business combination are based upon reasonable estimate and assumption given the fact and circumstance of the related valuation date intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset would be deemed finite lived and would then be amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time during the period the asset are considered indefinite lived they will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis well between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the ipr project below their respective carrying amount the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible asset is dependent on assumption such the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestone change in projected revenue or change in discount rate significant judgment is employed in determining these assumption and change to our assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis intangible asset with finite useful life are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable of contingent consideration liability resulting from business combinationsin conjunction with our business combination and consolidation of variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary we have recorded contingent consideration liability payable upon the achievement of specified development regulatory approval sale based milestone event or financial result the contingent consideration liability are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition or initial consolidation date the model used in valuing these contingent consideration liability require the use of significant estimate and assumption including but not limited to estimate of revenue and operating profit related to the product or product candidate the probability of success for unapproved product candidate considering their stage of development the time and resource needed to complete the development and approval of product candidate the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risk including the inherent difficulty and uncertainty in developing product candidate such obtaining fda and other regulatory approval and risk related to the viability of and potential alternative treatment in any future target market we revalue contingent consideration obligation each reporting period and record change in their fair value in expense within our consolidated statement of income change in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability can result from update to one or multiple assumption such the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestone change in projected revenue or change in discount rate significant judgment is employed in determining these assumption of the acquisition date and for each subsequent reporting period update to assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period actual result may differ from estimate we had total contingent consideration liability of million of december and million of december tax provision we estimate our income tax provision including deferred tax asset and liability based on significant management judgment we evaluate the realization of all or portion of our deferred tax asset on quarterly basis we record valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that are more likely than not to be realized we consider future taxable income ongoing tax planning strategy and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for valuation allowance if we expect to realize deferred tax asset for which we have previously recorded valuation allowance we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made we are subject to income tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction including ireland due to economic and political condition various country are actively considering change to existing tax law we can not predict the form or timing of potential legislative change that could have material adverse impact on our result of operation in addition significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax we record liability related to uncertain tax position in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we do not believe any such uncertain tax position currently pending will have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statement although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period at december and we had total federal state and foreign unrecognized tax benefit of million and million respectively of the total unrecognized tax benefit million and million at december and respectively if recognized would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition of december we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by approximately million in the next month we expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authority regarding our uncertain tax position with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefit we are currently unable to make reasonable estimate to the period of cash settlement if any with the respective tax authority we file federal state and foreign income tax return in many jurisdiction in the united state and abroad for federal income tax purpose the statute of limitation is open for and onwards for certain acquired entity the statute of is open for all year from inception due to our utilization of their net operating loss and credit carried over from prior year for california income tax purpose the statute of limitation is open for and onwards our income tax return are audited by federal state and foreign tax authority we are currently under examination by the irs for the and tax year and by various state and foreign jurisdiction there are differing interpretation of tax law and regulation and result significant dispute may arise with these tax authority involving issue of the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we periodically evaluate our exposure associated with our tax filing position branded prescription drug fee we along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of the bpd fee which is calculated based on select government sale during each calendar year percentage of total industry government sale the fee is determined by estimating our total sale to government agency along with an assumption of the total pharmaceutical industry sale to government agency our estimate are based on past history along with expectation of future branded drug sale activity by along with other pharmaceutical company judgment is employed in determining these assumption update to assumption could have an impact on our result of operation adjustment to our estimate in the past have not been material in the irs issued final regulation related to the bpd fee which indicate that an entity obligation to pay it portion of the bpd fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sale in the previous year instead of the first qualifying sale in the current calendar year result of the final irs regulation we were required to recognize our fee of million and fee of million in our consolidated statement of income our bpd fee were approximately million million and million in and respectively the irs is expected to communicate the final bpd fee amount due for sale during the third quarter of and for sale during the third quarter

cancelable we historically have not canceled such contract these amount reflect commitment based on existing contract and do not reflect any future modification to or termination of existing contract or anticipated or potential new contract we had total gross unrecognized tax benefit liability including interest and penalty of million of december we believe that it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefit will decrease by approximately million in the next month we expect to have clarification from the irs and other tax authority regarding our uncertain tax position with respect to the remaining unrecognized tax benefit we are currently unable to make reasonable estimate to the period of cash settlement if any with the respective tax authority the unrecognized tax benefit were included in current and long term income tax payable and long term deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above recent accounting pronouncement the information required by this item is included in item note organization and summary of significant accounting policy in our consolidated financial statement included in this annual

our risk management program foreign currency exchange risk our operation include manufacturing and sale activity in the united state canada and ireland well sale activity in country outside the united state including europe and asia pacific result our financial result could be significantly affected by factor such change in foreign currency exchange rate or weak economic condition in the foreign market in which we distribute our product our operating result are exposed to change in foreign currency exchange rate between the dollar and various foreign currency the most significant of which is the euro when the dollar strengthens against these currency the relative value of sale made in the respective foreign currency decrease conversely when the dollar weakens against these currency the relative amount of such sale increase overall we are net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weaker dollar and are adversely affected by stronger dollar relative to those foreign currency in which we transact significant amount of business approximately of our product sale were denominated in foreign currency during to partially mitigate the impact of change in currency exchange rate on net cash flow from our foreign currency denominated sale we may enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contract we also hedge certain monetary asset and liability denominated in foreign currency which reduces but doe not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuation between the date transaction is recorded and the date that cash is collected or paid in general the market risk of these contract are offset by corresponding gain and loss on the transaction being hedged of december and we had open foreign currency forward contract with notional amount of billion and billion respectively hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and if realized would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contract the same hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rate compared with the dollar relative to exchange rate at december would have resulted in reduction in fair value of these contract of approximately million on this date and if realized would negatively affect earnings over the remaining life of the contract the analysis doe not consider the impact that hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate would have on

the security issuer the number of security in an unrealized loss position the severity and duration of the unrealized loss whether we have the intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of their amortized cost basis when we determine that the decline in fair value of an investment is below our accounting basis and this decline is other than temporary we reduce the carrying value of the security we hold and record loss for the amount of such decline result of entering into collaboration from time to time we may hold investment in non public company we record these nonmarketable security at cost in other long term asset le any amount for other than temporary impairment we regularly review our security for

specifically greece italy portugal and spain totaled approximately million of which million were greater than day past due and million were greater than day past due to date we have not experienced significant loss with respect to the collection of our account receivable we believe that our allowance for doubtful account wa adequate at december of the raw material and component that we utilize in our operation are obtained through single supplier certain of the raw material that we utilize in our operation are made at only one facility since the supplier of key component and raw material must be named in new drug application nda filed with the food and drug administration fda for product significant delay can occur if the qualification of new supplier is required if delivery of material from our supplier were interrupted for any reason we may be unable to ship our commercial product or to supply our product candidate for clinical trial account receivable trade account receivable are recorded net of allowance for wholesaler chargebacks related to government and other program cash discount for prompt payment and doubtful account estimate for wholesaler chargebacks for government and other program and cash discount are based on contractual term historical trend and our expectation regarding the utilization rate for these program estimate of our allowance for doubtful account are determined based on existing contractual payment term historical payment pattern of our customer and individual customer circumstance an analysis of day sale outstanding by geographic region and review of the local economic environment and it potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practice historically the amount of uncollectible account receivable that have been written off have been insignificant and consistent with management expectation inventory inventory are recorded at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on first in first out basis we periodically review the composition of our inventory in order to identify obsolete slow moving or otherwise unsaleable item if unsaleable item are observed and there are no alternate us for the inventory we will record write down to net realizable value in the period that the impairment is first recognized when future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized based on management judgment we capitalize pre launch inventory cost prior to regulatory approval number of factor are taken into consideration including the current

business combination intangible asset with indefinite useful life are related to purchased in process research and development ipr project and are measured at their respective fair value of the acquisition date we do not amortize goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite useful life intangible asset related to ipr project are considered to be indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated effort if and when development is complete which generally occurs if and when regulatory approval to market product is obtained the associated asset are deemed finite lived and are amortized based on their respective estimated useful life at that point in time we test goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis and in between annual test if we become aware of any event or change that would indicate the fair value of the asset are below their carrying amount intangible asset with finite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life primarily on straight line basis and are reviewed for impairment when fact or circumstance suggest that the carrying value of these asset may not be recoverable impairment of long lived asset the carrying value of long lived asset is reviewed on regular basis for the existence of fact or circumstance both internally and externally that may suggest impairment specific potential indicator of impairment include significant decrease in the fair value of an asset significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or significant physical change in an asset significant adverse change in legal factor or in the business climate that affect the value of an asset an adverse action or assessment by the fda or another regulator an accumulation of cost significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset and operating or cash flow loss combined with history of operating or cash flow loss or projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing loss associated with an income producing asset should there be an indication of impairment we will test for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and it eventual disposition to the carrying amount of the asset or asset group any excess of the carrying value of the asset or asset group over it estimated fair value will be recognized an impairment loss valuation of contingent consideration resulting from business combinationin connection with certain business combination we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of specified development regulatory approval or sale based milestone event we record contingent consideration resulting from business combination at it fair value on the acquisition date in connection with the consolidation of variable interest entity for which we are primary beneficiary we record contingent consideration related to future earn out payment based upon percentage of gross margin of the entity each reporting period thereafter we revalue these obligation and record change in their fair value within our consolidated statement of income we record change in fair value related to future milestone payment expense until such time that the related product candidate receives marketing approval change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from update to assumption such the expected timing or probability of achieving the specified milestone change in projected revenue or change in discount rate significant judgment is employed in determining these assumption of the acquisition or consolidation date and for each subsequent period update to assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period actual result may differ from estimate foreign currency translation transaction gain and loss and hedging contract non entity operation are recorded in the functional currency of each entity result of operation for non dollar functional currency entity are translated into dollar using average currency

foreign currency transaction gain and loss are recorded in other income expense net on our consolidated statement of income net foreign currency transaction gain totaled million in and loss totaled million in and million in we hedge portion of our foreign currency exposure related to outstanding monetary asset and liability well forecasted product sale using foreign currency exchange forward and option contract in general the market risk related to these contract is offset by corresponding gain and loss on the hedged transaction the credit risk associated with these contract is driven by change in interest and currency exchange rate and result varies over time by working only with major bank and closely monitoring current market condition we seek to limit the risk that counterparties to these contract may be unable to perform we also seek to limit our risk of loss by entering into contract that permit net settlement at maturity therefore our overall risk of loss in the event of counterparty default is limited to the amount of any unrecognized gain on outstanding contract those contract that have positive fair value at the date of default we do not enter into derivative contract for trading purpose nor do we hedge our net investment in any of our foreign subsidiary value of financial instrument we apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and non financial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on recurring basis we define fair value the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk derivative financial instrumentswe recognize all derivative instrument either asset or liability at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet change in the fair value of derivative are recorded each period in current earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss depending on whether derivative is designated part of hedge transaction and if it is the type of hedge transaction we classify the cash flow from these instrument in the same category the cash flow from the hedged item we do not hold or issue derivative instrument for trading or speculative purpose we ass both at inception and on an ongoing basis whether the derivative that are used in hedging transaction are highly effective in offsetting the change in cash flow or fair value of the hedged item we also ass hedge ineffectiveness on quarterly basis and record the gain or loss related to the ineffective portion to current earnings to the extent significant if we determine that forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring we discontinue hedge accounting for the affected portion of the hedge instrument and any related unrealized gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings income tax our income tax provision is computed under the liability method deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse significant estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax some of these estimate are based on interpretation of existing tax law or regulation we record liability related to uncertain tax position in accordance with the guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise financial statement by prescribing minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we do not believe any such uncertain tax position currently pending will have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statement although an adverse resolution of one or more of these uncertain tax position in any period could have material impact on the result of operation for that period branded prescription drug feewe along with other pharmaceutical manufacturer of branded drug product are required to pay portion of the bpd fee which is calculated based on select government sale during each calendar year percentage of total industry government sale in the internal revenue service irs issued final regulation related to the bpd fee which indicate that an entity obligation to pay it portion of the bpd fee in any given calendar year is triggered by the qualifying sale in the previous

december and million of december on our consolidated balance sheet recent accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standard board jointly with the international accounting standard board issued comprehensive new standard on revenue recognition from contract with customer the standard core principle is that reporting entity will recognize revenue when it transfer promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service in applying this new guidance to contract within it scope an entity will identify the contract with customer identify the performance obligation in the contract determine the transaction price allocate the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract and recognize revenue when or the entity satisfies performance obligation additionally this new guidance will require significantly expanded revenue recognition disclosure this guidance will become effective for beginning in the first quarter of early application is not permitted entity have the option of using either full or modified retrospective approach to adopt this new guidance we are currently evaluating the impact of our adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statement fair value measurement we determine the fair value of financial and non financial asset and liability using the fair value hierarchy which establishes three level of input that may be used to measure fair value follows level input which include quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input which include observable input other than level input such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active or other input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability for our marketable security we review trading activity and pricing of the measurement date when sufficient quoted pricing for identical security is not available we use market pricing and other observable market input for similar security obtained from various third party data provider these input either represent quoted price for similar asset in active market or have been derived from observable market data and level input which include unobservable input that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset or liability level asset and liability include those whose fair value measurement are determined using pricing model discounted cash flow methodology or similar valuation technique and significant management judgment or

by performing review of the assumption listed above and record increase or decrease in the fair value of these contingent consideration obligation within our consolidated statement of income we record fair value related to future milestone payment in expense until such time that the related product candidate receives marketing approval the change in the fair value of future earn out payment is recorded in selling general and administrative sg expense in the absence of any significant change in key assumption the quarterly determination of fair value of these contingent consideration obligation would primarily reflect the passage of time judgment is employed in determining level input and fair value measurement of the acquisition date or initial consolidation date and for each subsequent period update to assumption could have significant impact on our result of operation in any given period and actual result may differ from estimate for example significant increase in the probability of achieving milestone or projected revenue would result in significantly higher fair value measurement while significant decrease in the estimated probability of achieving milestone or projected revenue would result in significantly lower fair value measurement significant increase in the discount rate or in the anticipated timeline would result in significantly lower fair value measurement while significant decrease in the discount rate or anticipated timeline would result in significantly higher fair value measurement the potential contingent consideration payment required

significant of these are described below it is not possible to determine the outcome of these matter and we can not reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure or the range of possible loss litigation related to sofosbuvirin january we acquired pharmasset through the acquisition we acquired sofosbuvir nucleotide analog that act to inhibit the replication of the hcv in december we received fda approval of sofosbuvir now known commercially sovaldi in october we also received approval of the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir now known commercially harvoni we own patent and patent application that claim sofosbuvir sovaldi chemical entity and it metabolite and the fixed dose combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir harvoni third party may have or may obtain right to patent that allegedly could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent from commercializing sovaldi or harvoni for example we are aware of patent and patent application owned by other party that may be alleged by such party to cover the use of sovaldi and harvoni we can not predict the ultimate outcome of intellectual property claim related to sovaldi or harvoni and we have spent and will continue to spend significant resource defending against these claim if these party successfully obtain valid and enforceable patent and successfully prove infringement of those patent by sovaldi and or harvoni we could be prevented from selling sofosbuvir unless we were able to obtain license under such patent such license may not be available on commercially reasonable term or at all we can not predict the ultimate outcome of the intellectual property claim related to sofosbuvir and may spend significant resource enforcing and defending our patent any range of loss can not be estimated at this time current legal proceeding of significance regarding sofosbuvir include arbitration with hoffman la roche ltd and hoffman la roche inc collectively roche gilead successor to pharmasset is party to collaboration agreement with roche the agreement granted roche right to develop psi cytidine analog and it prodrugs for the treatment of hcv infection the collaborative research effort under the agreement ended in in march roche served an arbitration against and pharmasset predecessor to gilead pharmasset llc in the arbitration demand roche asserted that it had an exclusive license to sofosbuvir pursuant to the collaboration agreement because sofosbuvir prodrug of uridine analog is allegedly prodrug of psi cytidine analog roche further claimed that because it had exclusive right to sofosbuvir it also had an exclusive license to patent covering sofosbuvir and that we infringed that patent by selling and offering for sale product containing sofosbuvir gilead and gilead pharmasset llc filed their response to roche arbitration demand in april the arbitration hearing wa held in june in august the arbitration panel determined that roche failed to establish any of their claim and ruled in our favor result roche is not entitled to any damage or other relief proceeding and litigation with idenix pharmaceutical inc in february we received notice that the patent and trademark office uspto had declared interference no first idenix interference between our patent no the patent and idenix pending patent application no an interference is an administrative proceeding before the uspto designed to determine who wa the first to invent the subject matter claimed by both party our patent cover metabolite of sofosbuvir idenix is attempting to patent class of compound including these metabolite the purpose of the first idenix interference wa to determine who wa first to invent these compound and therefore who is entitled to the patent claiming these compound in march the uspto patent trial and appeal board the board determined that idenix is not entitled to the benefit of any of it early application filing date because none of those patent application including the application granted idenix patent no the patent taught how to make the compound in dispute the board also determined that because we are entitled to the filing date of our earliest application we were first to file the patent application on the compound in dispute and we were therefore the senior party in the first idenix interference on january the board determined that pharmasset and not idenix wa the first to invent the compound in dispute and accordingly gilead prevailed in the first idenix interference in it decision the board held that idenix failed to prove that it wa first to conceive of any of the compound in dispute specifically idenix failed to prove that the idenix inventor had identified the structure method of making and use for any of the disputed compound the board went on to conclude that idenix failed to work diligently toward making and testing the compound in dispute during the relevant time period idenix ha appealed the board decision to the district court for the district of delaware in december after receiving our request to do so the uspto declared interference no second idenix interference between our pending patent application no and the patent the patent includes claim directed to method of treating hcv with nucleoside compound similar to those which were involved in the first idenix interference the second idenix interference will determine who wa first to invent the claimed method of treating hcv on january the board issued decision in favor of gilead in the first phase of the second idenix interference the board decided that we were first to file the patent application on the disputed method of treating hcv designated gilead the senior party in the second idenix interference and invalidated the patent claim of the idenix patent that are involved in the second idenix interference the senior party we are presumed to be the first to have invented the disputed method of treating hcv because idenix failed to teach how to make and use the invention in it patent the board invalidated the idenix claim involved in the second idenix interference for lack of enablement the board ha also placed idenix under an order to show cause requiring idenix to explain why judgment should not be entered against it in the second idenix interference based upon the decision by the board in the first idenix interference the decision in the second idenix interference is consistent with the board earlier ruling in march and january in the first idenix interference in which gilead wa declared the senior party and the first to invent certain fluoro methyl nucleoside compound these compound are relevant to the method of treating hcv at issue in the second idenix interference we believe that the idenix claim involved in the first and second idenix interference and similar and foreign patent claiming the same compound metabolite and us thereof are invalid result we filed an impeachment action in the federal court of canada to invalidate idenix canadian patent no the patent which is the canadian patent that corresponds to the patent and the idenix patent application that wa the subject of the first idenix interference idenix ha asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in canada will infringe it patent and that our canadian patent no corresponding to the patent involved in the first idenix interference is invalid trial on these issue commenced in january we filed similar legal action in norway in the oslo district court seeking to invalidate idenix norwegian patent corresponding to the patent in september idenix filed an invalidation action in the norwegian proceeding against our norwegian patent no patent which corresponds to the patent on march the norwegian court found all claim in the idenix norwegian patent to be invalid and upheld the validity of all claim in the challenged gilead patent on april idenix appealed the march decision to the norwegian court of appeal idenix obligation to pay our attorney fee will be stayed during the pendency of the appeal the appeal from the march decision is scheduled to commence in february in january we filed legal action in the federal court of australia seeking to invalidate idenix australian patent corresponding to the patent in april idenix asserted that the commercialization of sovaldi in australia will infringe the australian patent corresponding to the patent trial on these issue is scheduled to commence in september in sydney on march the european patent office epo granted idenix european patent no the patent which corresponds to the patent the same day that the patent granted we filed an opposition with the epo seeking to revoke the patent also on that day idenix initiated infringement proceeding against gilead in the united kingdom uk germany and france alleging that the commercialization of sovaldi in those country would infringe the respective national counterpart of the patent in the united kingdom trial wa held in october to determine the issue of and validity of the idenix uk patent in december the high court of justice of england and wale uk court invalidated all claim of the patent on multiple ground specifically the uk court held that the patent lacked novelty over our earlier filed patent application teaching some of the same compound the patent lacked an inventive step because it did not add anything to the knowledge existing at the time and the disclosure in the idenix patent application wa insufficient because it did not teach how to make the compound or show which of the claimed compound would have activity against virus like the hepatitis virus the uk court granted idenix permission to appeal the december judgment on february the german court in düsseldorf held hearing to determine the issue of infringement of the idenix german patent we do not have trial date for the french lawsuit idenix ha not been awarded patent corresponding to the patent in japan or china in the event such patent issue we expect to challenge them in proceeding similar to those we invoked in other country in december idenix universita degli studi di cagliari udsg centre national de la recherche scientifique and université montpellier ii sued in district court for the district of delaware alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe the patent and that an interference exists between the patent and our patent no also in december idenix and udsg sued in the district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that the commercialization of sofosbuvir will infringe patent no and on june the court in massachusetts granted our request and transferred the massachusetts litigation to the district court for the district of delaware we believe that idenix patent are invalid and would not be infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir the district court ha set trial date in october and december for resolution of these issue decision by the district court can be appealed by either party to the court of appeal for the federal circuit cafc idenix wa acquired by merck in august while the acquisition doe not change our view of the lack of merit in the claim made by idenix merck ha greater resource than idenix and may therefore choose to fund the litigation at higher level than idenix litigation with merck co inc in august merck contacted requesting that we pay royalty on the sale of sofosbuvir and obtain license to patent no and which it co owns with isi pharmaceutical inc we believe that merck patent are invalid and are not infringed by our commercialization of sofosbuvir and that we have the sole right to commercialize sofosbuvir in august we filed lawsuit in the district court for the northern district of california seeking declaratory judgment that the merck patent are invalid and not infringed merck patent no and cover compound which do not include but may relate to sofosbuvir during patent prosecution merck amended it patent application in an attempt to cover compound related to sofosbuvir with the apparent goal of ultimately extracting royalty payment for sofosbuvir commercialization or eliminating competition by excluding it from the market if the court determines that merck patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to merck to commercialize sofosbuvir either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the court ha set trial date of march for this lawsuit litigation with abbvie inc abbvie abbvie ha obtained patent no and abbvie patent which purport to cover the use of combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir or harvoni for the treatment of hcv gilead is aware that abbvie ha pending patent application in the united state and other country we own published and pending patent application directed to the use of combination for the treatment of hcv and specifically to the combination of ledipasvir and sofosbuvir certain of our application were filed before the abbvie patent for this reason and others we believe the abbvie patent are invalid accordingly in december we filed lawsuit in the district court for the district of delaware seeking declaratory judgment that the abbvie patent are invalid and unenforceable well other relief we believe that abbott laboratory inc and abbvie conspired to eliminate competition in the hcv market by falsely representing to the uspto that they and not gilead invented method of treating hcv using combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir in february and march abbvie responded to our lawsuit by filing two lawsuit also in the district court for the district of delaware alleging that our fixed dose combination of ledipasvir sofosbuvir will infringe it patent all of those lawsuit have been consolidated into single action in the united state either party can appeal decision by the district court to the cafc the abbvie patent have not blocked or delayed the commercialization of our combination product in the united state or europe we do not expect any other foreign patent to block or delay the commercialization around the world if court determines that abbvie patent are valid and that we have infringed those claim we may be required to obtain license from and pay royalty to abbvie to commercialize sofosbuvir combination product litigation with generic manufacturer part of the approval process for some of our product the fda granted new chemical entity nce exclusivity period during

patent trial and appeal board ptab issued decision denying each of mylan petition for ipr against the tenofovir disoproxil fumarate associated patent on the ground that mylan had not established

valuation model the black scholes option valuation model wa developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded option which have no vesting restriction and are fully transferable in addition
