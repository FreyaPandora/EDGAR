however significant portion of our operating expenditure and capital purchase are incurred in other currency primarily the euro the japanese yen the israeli shekel and the chinese yuan we have established currency risk management program to protect against currency exchange rate risk associated with non dollar forecasted future cash flow and existing non dollar monetary asset and liability we may also hedge currency risk arising from funding of foreign currency denominated future investment we may utilize foreign currency contract such currency forward or option contract in these

equity security and equity derivative instrument we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our equity market exposure through hedging activity at the inception of our investment in the event we do decide to enter into hedge arrangement before so we evaluate legal market and economic factor well the expected timing of disposal to determine whether hedging is appropriate our equity market risk management program may include equity derivative with or without hedge accounting designation that utilize warrant equity option or other equity derivative we also utilize total return swap to offset change in liability related to the equity market risk of certain deferred compensation arrangement gain or loss from change in fair value of these total return swap are generally offset by the

patent and other ip may already have patent covering similar product there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain patent covering our own product or that we will be able to obtain license from other company on favorable term or at all the software that we distribute including software embedded in our component level and platform product is entitled to copyright and other ip protection to distinguish our product from our competitor product we have obtained trademark and trade name for our product and we maintain cooperative advertising program with customer to promote our brand and to identify product containing genuine intel component we also protect detail about our process product and strategy trade secret keeping confidential the information that we believe provides with competitive advantage intel carefully protects it innovation and we have long history of vigilantly enforcing our ip right against infringement strong ip protection make it possible for intel to continue to invest the enormous resource required to innovate and advance our strategic goal to make the world best semiconductor lead technology inflection and be the leading end to end platform provider for the new data world steve rodgers executive vice president and general counsel other key information of contentscritical accounting estimatesthe method assumption and estimate that we use in applying our accounting policy may require to apply judgment regarding matter that are inherently uncertain we consider an accounting policy to be critical estimate if we must make assumption that were uncertain when the judgment wa made and change in the estimate assumption or selection of different estimate methodology could have significant impact on our financial position and the result that we report in our consolidated financial statement while we believe that our estimate assumption and judgment are reasonable they are based on information available when the estimate wa made refer to note accounting policy within the consolidated financial statement for further information on our critical accounting estimate and policy which are follows inventory the transition of manufacturing cost to inventory excluding factory excess capacity cost inventory reflected at the lower of cost or net realizable value considering future demand and market condition long lived asset the valuation method and assumption used in assessing the impairment of property plant and equipment identified intangible and goodwill including the determination of asset grouping and the identification and allocation of goodwill to reporting unit non marketable equity investment the valuation estimate and assessment of impairment and observable price adjustment and loss contingency the estimation of when loss is probable and reasonably estimable risk factorsthe following risk could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition cash flow and result of operation and the trading price of our common stock could decline these risk factor do not identify all risk that we face our operation could also be affected by factor that are not presently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operation due to risk and uncertainty known and unknown our past financial result may not be reliable indicator of future performance and historical trend should not be used to anticipate result or trend in future period refer also to the other information set forth in this annual report on form including in md and our consolidated financial statement and the related note change in product demand can adversely affect our financial result demand for our product is variable and hard to predict our product are used in different market segment and demand for our product varies within or among the market segment served by our pc centric and data centric business it is difficult to forecast these change and their impact for example in the first half of customer of our dcg business worked through inventory and absorbed computing capacity purchased in leading to year over year decline in dcg platform revenue in the first half followed by growth in dcg platform demand and revenue in the second half of change in the demand for our product particularly our ccg and dcg platform product can reduce our revenue lower our gross margin or require to write down the value of our asset important factor that lead to variation in the demand for our product include business condition including downturn in the market segment in which we operate or in the global or regional economy consumer confidence or income level and the level of customer capital spending which may be impacted by change in market condition including change in government borrowing taxation or spending policy the credit market or expected inflation employment and energy or other commodity price our ability to timely introduce competitive product competitive and pricing pressure including new product introduction and other action taken by competitor the level of our customer inventory and computing capacity customer order pattern including order cancellation which can be affected by maturing product cycle for our product customer product and related product such operating system upgrade cycle disruption affecting customer and other factor market acceptance and industry support of our new and maturing product including the introduction and availability of product used together with our product and customer product need and emerging technology trend including change in the level and nature of customer and end user computing workload other key information of contentsdue to the complexity of our manufacturing operation we are not always able to timely respond to fluctuation in demand and we may incur significant charge and cost because we own and operate high tech fabrication facility our operation have high cost that are fixed or difficult to reduce in the short term including our cost related to utilization of existing facility facility construction and equipment and the employment and training of highly skilled workforce to the extent product demand decrease or we fail to forecast demand accurately we could be required to write off inventory or record excess capacity charge which would lower our gross margin to the extent the demand decrease is prolonged our manufacturing or assembly and test capacity could be underutilized and we may be required to write down our long lived asset which would increase our expense we may also be required to shorten the useful life of under used facility and equipment and accelerate depreciation conversely to the extent product demand increase or we fail to forecast accurately and produce the mix of product demanded we may be unable to add capacity or increase production fast enough to meet market demand which can result in loss of revenue opportunity or market share legal claim and or damage to customer relationship for example we have been experiencing supply constraint and have been prioritizing production of our server and high performance pc product which during contributed to loss of share in the value end of the pc market where we were short of supply while demand remained healthy we face significant competition the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market development change in industry standard change in customer and end user need expectation and preference and frequent product introduction and improvement if we do not anticipate and respond to these development our competitive position can weaken and our product or technology can become uncompetitive or obsolete our competitive environment ha intensified and we expect it to continue to do so in the future our product primarily compete based on performance energy efficiency integration ease of use innovative design feature price quality reliability security software ecosystem and developer support time to market reliable product roadmap execution brand recognition customer support and customization and availability the importance of these factor varies by product for example performance is key competitive factor for data center platform product and failure to introduce new product with performance advantage can harm our competitive position and market segment share in our dcg business for our memory product price density and non volatility are among the most important competitive factor we will not realize our strategic goal to become the leading end to end provider for the new data world if our product do not meet our customer requirement across these factor in an increasingly competitive landscape we face intense competition across our product portfolio from company offering platform product such amd and qualcomm accelerator product such gpus including those offered by nvidia other accelerator product such asics application specific standard product and fpgas memory and storage product connectivity and networking product and other semiconductor product some of these competitor have developed or utilize competing computing architecture and platform for specific market segment or application such the arm architecture and these architecture and platform can produce beneficial network effect for competitor when an ecosystem of customer and application developer for such architecture and platform grows at scale we also compete with internally developed semiconductor from oems cloud service provider and others including customer some of these customer vertically integrate their own semiconductor design with their software asset or customize their design for specific computing workload most of our competitor rely on third party foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd or samsung electronics co ltd and subcontractor for manufacture and assembly and test of their semiconductor component and product an idm we have higher capital expenditure and spending than many of our fable competitor we also face new source of competition result of change in industry participant through for example acquisition or business collaboration well new entrant including in china which could have significant impact on our competitive position introduction of competitive new product and technology aggressive pricing and other action taken by competitor can harm demand for our product exert downward pricing pressure on our product and adversely affect our business additionally number of business combination and strategic partnership in the semiconductor industry have occurred over the last several year and more could occur in the future consolidation could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result to compete successfully we must maintain successful effort develop new product and production process and improve our existing product and process all ahead of competitor we are focusing our effort across six engineering pillar process technology architecture memory interconnect security and software these include ambitious initiative such our unified oneapi portfolio of developer tool and we can not guarantee that all of these effort will deliver the benefit we anticipate for example to the extent we do not timely introduce new manufacturing process technology that improve transistor density with sufficient manufacturing yield and operational efficiency relative to competing foundry process we can face cost and product performance disadvantage similarly to the extent our effort do not timely produce semiconductor design for our platform product with improvement in area like performance performance per watt die utilization and core count and with new feature such optimization for ai and other workload our competitive position can be harmed we do not expect all of our investment to be successful some of our effort to develop and market new product fail and the product and technology we invest in and develop are not always well received by customer who may adopt competing technology we make significant investment in and our investment at time do not contribute to our future operating result for several year if at all and such contribution at time do not meet our expectation or even cover the cost of such investment if we are not able to compete effectively our financial result will be adversely affected including reduced revenue and gross margin and we may be required to accelerate the write down of the value of certain asset other key information of contentsour investment in new business product and technology are inherently risky and do not always succeed in recent year in connection with our strategic transformation to data centric company we have entered new area and introduced adjacent product in programmable solution ai and autonomous driving we also expanded our adjacent product offering in client computing the data center the internet of thing and memory with offering such modem silicon photonics solution and intel optane technology product and we have made investment in discrete graphic and networking infrastructure product these effort are not always successful in april we announced that we would be exiting the smartphone modem business based on our determination that there wa no clear path to profitability for the business and in november we completed the sale of the majority of our smartphone modem business these new and developing area and product represent significant portion of our expanded tam and they also introduce new source of competition including in certain of these market segment incumbent competitor with established technology and customer base lower price or cost and greater brand recognition these developing product and market segment require significant investment do not always grow significantly projected or at all or sometimes utilize technology that are different from the one that we develop and manufacture and we may not realize an adequate return on our investment for example ai and machine learning are increasingly driving innovation in technology but if they fail to deliver the benefit anticipated or if our customer use competing technology for these workload we may not realize return on our investment in these area similarly while we see significant opportunity in networking infrastructure and the distribution of computing to the network edge we expect intense competition for this opportunity and may not succeed in our effort to be successful we need to cultivate new industry relationship with customer and partner in these market segment in addition we must continually improve the cost performance integration time to market and energy efficiency of our product well expand our software capability to provide customer with comprehensive computing solution some of these new business face challenging market condition for example market pricing for nand memory product ha been and may continue to be highly volatile and nand pricing pressure led to an operating loss for our nsg business in despite our ongoing effort there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our product and service in these various market segment or realize an adequate return on our investment which could lead to impairment of asset and restructuring charge change in the mix of product sold can impact our financial result our pricing and margin vary across our product and market segment due in part to marketability of our product and difference in their feature or manufacturing cost for example our platform product offering range from lower priced and entry level platform such those based on intel atom processor to higher end platform based on intel xeon processor our adjacent product also typically have significantly lower margin than our higher priced platform product to the extent demand shift from our higher priced to lower priced platform product in any of our market segment or our adjacent product represent an increasingly greater share of our mix of product sold our gross margin percentage may decrease we operate globally and are subject to significant risk in many jurisdiction global or regional condition can harm our financial result we have manufacturing assembly and test sale and other operation in many country and some of our business activity are concentrated in one or more geographic area moreover sale outside the accounted for approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended december with revenue from billing to china including hong kong contributing approximately of our total revenue result our operation and our financial result including our ability to manufacture assemble and test design develop or sell product and the demand for our product are at time adversely affected by number of global and regional factor outside of our control adverse change in global or regional economic condition including recession or slowing growth change or uncertainty in fiscal monetary or trade policy higher interest rate tighter credit inflation lower capital expenditure by business including on it infrastructure increase in unemployment and lower consumer confidence and spending periodically occur and can significantly harm demand for our product and make it more challenging to forecast our operating result and make business decision including regarding prioritization of investment in our business an economic downturn or increased uncertainty may also lead to increased credit and collectability risk higher borrowing cost or limit on our access to capital market reduced liquidity adverse impact on our supplier failure of counterparties and other financial institution and decline in the value of our financial instrument international trade dispute at time result in increased tariff trade barrier and other protectionist measure that can increase our manufacturing cost make our product le competitive reduce demand for our product limit our ability to sell to certain customer limit our ability to procure component or raw material or impede or slow the movement of our good across border increasing protectionism and economic nationalism may lead to further change in trade policy domestic sourcing initiative or other formal and informal measure that could make it more difficult to sell our product in or restrict our access to some market escalating trade tension between the and china have led to increased tariff and trade restriction including tariff applicable to some of our product and have affected customer ordering pattern the ha imposed restriction on the export of regulated product and technology to certain chinese technology company including certain of our customer these restriction have reduced our sale and continuing or future restriction could adversely affect our financial result result in reputational harm to due to our relationship with such company or lead such company to develop or adopt technology that compete with our product it is difficult to predict what further trade related action government may take which may include additional or increased tariff and trade restriction and we may be unable to quickly and effectively react to such action for example legislation ha expanded the power of the department of commerce to restrict the export of emerging and foundational technology yet to be identified which could impact our current or future product other key information of contentstrade dispute and protectionist measure or continued uncertainty about such matter could result in declining consumer confidence and slowing economic growth or recession and could cause our customer to reduce cancel or alter the timing of their purchase with sustained trade tension could lead to long term change in global trade and technology supply chain which could adversely affect our business and growth prospect we can be adversely affected by other global and regional factor that periodically occur including geopolitical and security issue such armed conflict and civil or military unrest political instability human right concern and terrorist activity including for example geopolitical tension and conflict affecting israel where our mobileye business headquarters and certain of our fabrication facility are located natural disaster public health issue and other catastrophic event inefficient infrastructure and other disruption such supply chain interruption and large scale outage or unreliable provision of service from utility transportation data hosting or telecommunication provider formal or informal imposition of new or revised export import or doing business regulation including trade sanction tariff and change in the ability to obtain export license which could be changed without notice government restriction on or nationalization of our operation in any country or restriction on our ability to repatriate earnings from particular country adverse change relating to government grant tax credit or other government incentive differing employment practice and labor issue ineffective legal protection of our ip right in certain country local business and cultural factor that differ from our current standard and practice continuing uncertainty regarding social political immigration and tax and trade policy in the and abroad including result of the united kingdom vote to withdraw from the european union fluctuation in the market value of our domestic and international investment which can be negatively affected by liquidity credit deterioration or loss interest rate change financial result political risk sovereign risk or other factor and uncertainty regarding libor certain of our interest rate derivative and investment are based on libor and portion of our indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rate primarily based on libor libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposal for reform which may cause libor to disappear entirely after or to perform differently than in the past and while we expect that reasonable alternative to libor will be implemented prior to the target date we can not predict the consequence and timing of these development and they could include an increase in our interest expense and or reduction in our interest income we are subject to law and regulation worldwide that differ among jurisdiction affecting our operation in area including but not limited to ip ownership and infringement tax import and export requirement anti corruption foreign exchange control and cash repatriation restriction data privacy requirement competition advertising employment product regulation environment health and safety requirement and consumer law compliance with such requirement can be onerous and expensive and may otherwise impact our business operation negatively for example unfavorable development with evolving law and regulation worldwide related to or autonomous driving technology may limit global adoption impede our strategy and negatively impact our long term expectation for our investment in these area expanding privacy legislation and compliance cost of privacy related and data protection measure could adversely affect our customer and their product and service particularly in cloud internet of thing and ai application which could in turn reduce demand for our product used for those workload although we have policy control and procedure designed to help ensure compliance with applicable law there can be no assurance that our employee contractor supplier or agent will not violate such law or our policy violation of these law and regulation can result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or our employee prohibition on the conduct of our business and damage to our reputation the technology industry is subject to intense medium political and regulatory scrutiny which can increase our exposure to government investigation legal action and penalty we are affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate we are exposed to adverse well beneficial movement in currency exchange rate although most of our sale occur in dollar expense may be paid in local currency an increase in the value of the dollar can increase the real cost to our customer of our product in those market outside the where we sell in dollar and weakened dollar can increase the cost of expense such payroll utility tax and marketing expense well overseas capital expenditure we also conduct certain investing and financing activity in local currency our hedging program may not be effective to offset any or more than portion of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movement therefore change in exchange rate can harm our result of operation and financial condition other key information of contentscatastrophic event can have material adverse effect on our operation and financial result our operation and business and those of our customer and supplier can be disrupted by natural disaster industrial accident public health issue cybersecurity incident interruption of service from utility transportation telecommunication or it system provider manufacturing equipment failure or other catastrophic event for example we have at time experienced disruption in our manufacturing process result of power outage improperly functioning equipment and disruption in supply of raw material or component including due to cybersecurity incident affecting our supplier our headquarters and many of our operation and facility are in location that are prone to earthquake and other natural disaster global climate change can result in certain natural disaster occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such drought wildfire storm sea level rise and flooding and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facility located in semi arid region catastrophic event could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver product to our customer receive production material from our supplier or perform critical function which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditure to resume operation while we maintain business recovery plan that are intended to enable to recover from natural disaster or other event that can be disruptive to our business some of our system are not fully redundant and we can not be sure that our plan will fully protect from all such disruption furthermore even if our operation are unaffected or recover quickly if our customer can not timely resume their own operation due to catastrophic event they may reduce or cancel their order which may adversely affect our result of operation we maintain program of insurance coverage for variety of property casualty and other risk the type and amount of insurance we obtain vary depending on availability cost and decision with respect to risk retention some of our policy have large deductible and broad exclusion in addition one or more of our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim loss not covered by insurance may be large which could harm our result of operation and financial condition damage to our reputation can damage our business our reputation is critical factor in our relationship with customer employee government supplier and other stakeholder our failure to address or the appearance of our failure to address issue that give rise to reputational risk including those described throughout this risk factor section could significantly harm our reputation and our brand our reputation is also impacted by how we respond to corporate crisis corporate crisis can arise from catastrophic event well from incident involving unethical behavior or misconduct product quality security or safety issue allegation of legal noncompliance internal control failure corporate governance issue data breach workplace safety incident environmental incident the use of our product for illegal or objectionable application marketing practice medium statement the conduct of our supplier or representative and other issue or incident that whether actual or perceived result in adverse publicity to the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address such crisis the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brand and could lead to increase in litigation claim and asserted damage or subject to regulatory action or restriction damage to our reputation could reduce demand for our product and adversely affect our business and operating environment it could reduce investor confidence in adversely affecting our stock price it may also limit our ability to be seen an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employee moreover repairing our reputation and brand may be difficult time consuming and expensive we are vulnerable to product and manufacturing related risk we are subject to risk associated with the development and implementation of new manufacturing process technology production of integrated circuit is complex process realizing the economics of moore law is strategic priority and we are continually engaged in the development of next generation process technology at increasingly advanced node we are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process node and production process for example we experienced significant delay in implementing our process technology although we began shipping product based on our process technology in volume in our delay in transitioning to this node occurred while third party foundry developed new competitive process technology competitor using third party foundry are able to benefit from the improvement such process technology made in performance energy efficiency and other feature which can help increase the competitiveness of their product our effort to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risk including difficulty in designing and developing next generation process technology and investment in manufacturing asset and facility that are made year in advance of the process node introduction we can not guarantee that we will realize the expected benefit of next generation process technology including the expected cost and density advantage or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital investment particularly development of new node ha grown increasingly expensive risk inherent in the development of next generation process technology include production timing delay lower than anticipated manufacturing yield longer manufacturing throughput time and product defect and erratum production timing delay have at time caused to miss customer product design window which can result in lost revenue opportunity and damage to our customer relationship furthermore when the introduction of next generation process node is delayed including additional competitive feature in our product can result in larger die size product manufacturing supply constraint and increased product cost lower manufacturing yield and longer manufacturing throughput time compared to previous process node can increase our product cost and adversely affect our gross margin and can contribute to manufacturing supply constraint in addition the die size of our product ha increased and our manufacturing process node have shrunk our product and manufacturing process have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defect and erratum which can also contribute to production timing delay and lower yield other key information of contentsfrom time to time disruption in the production process result from error defect in material delay in obtaining or revising operating permit and license interruption in our supply of material or resource and disruption at our fabrication and assembly and test facility due to accident maintenance issue or unsafe working condition all of which could affect the timing of production ramp and yield production issue periodically lead to increased cost and affect our ability to meet product demand which can adversely impact our business and the result of operation in addition to the extent we face delay in the timing of our product introduction we could become le competitive and lose revenue opportunity and our gross margin could be adversely affected because we incur significant cost up front in the product development stage and earn revenue to offset these cost over time we face supply chain risk thousand of supplier provide material and equipment that we use in production and other aspect of our business where possible we seek to have several source of supply however for certain material and equipment including certain photolithography tool we rely on single or limited number of supplier or upon supplier in single location in addition supplier consolidation or business failure can impact the nature quality availability and pricing of the product and service available to the inability of supplier to deliver necessary production material or equipment can disrupt our production process and make it more difficult for to implement our business strategy production can be disrupted by the unavailability of resource such water silicon electricity gas and other material the unavailability or reduced availability of material or resource can require to reduce production or incur additional cost which could harm our business and result of operation our manufacturing operation and ability to meet product demand may also be impacted by ip or other litigation between our supplier where an injunction against intel or supplier could interrupt the availability of good or service supplied to intel by others we also rely on third party provider to manufacture assemble and test and supply certain component or product these have included component and product related to networking communication programmable semiconductor solution and memory and may include these and other component and product in the future to the extent any of these third party are unable to perform these service on timely or cost effective basis in sufficient volume or at all we can encounter supply delay or disruption or incur additional cost that could adversely affect our business and financial result for example while we have supply agreement providing for the supply of intel xpoint memory from imft for period following the close of micron purchase of our interest in imft we will need to fund and develop internal manufacturing option to continue xpoint memory supply in the longer term in addition increased regulation or stakeholder expectation regarding responsible sourcing practice could cause our compliance cost to increase or result in publicity that negatively affect our reputation moreover given that we use many material in the manufacturing of our product and rely on many supplier to provide these material but do not directly control the procurement or employment practice of such supplier we could be subject to similar financial or reputational risk result of our supplier conduct we are subject to the risk of product defect erratum or other product issue from time to time we identify product defect erratum deviation from published specification and other product issue which can result from problem in our product design or our manufacturing and assembly and test process component and product we purchase or license from third party supplier or attain through acquisition can also contain defect product issue also sometimes result from the interaction between our product and third party product and software we also face risk if product that we design manufacture or sell or that include our technology cause personal injury or property damage even where the cause is unrelated to product defect or erratum these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market segment technology or application including transportation and autonomous driving healthcare communication and financial service and other industrial critical infrastructure and consumer us cost from defect erratum or other product issue could include writing off some or all of the value of inventory recalling product that have been shipped providing product replacement or modification reimbursing customer for certain cost they incur defending against litigation and or paying resulting damage and paying fine imposed by regulatory agency these cost could be large and may increase expense and lower gross margin and result in delay or loss of revenue mitigation technique designed to address product issue including software and firmware update are not always available on timely basis or at all do not always operate intended or effectively resolve such issue for all application and can result in adverse performance effect any product defect erratum or other issue could damage our reputation negatively affect product demand delay product release or result in legal liability product defect or erratum could cause customer to purchase product from competitor any of these occurrence could harm our business and financial result in addition although we maintain liability insurance our coverage ha certain exclusion or may not adequately cover liability incurred our insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to pay claim and loss not covered by insurance could be large which could harm our financial condition other key information of contentswe are subject to risk associated with environmental health and safety regulation the manufacturing and assembly and test of our product require the use of hazardous material that are subject to broad array of environmental health and safety law and regulation our failure to comply with these law or regulation can result in regulatory penalty fine and legal liability suspension of production alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test process damage to our reputation and restriction on our operation or sale our failure to manage the use transportation emission discharge storage recycling or disposal of hazardous material can lead to increased cost or future liability our ability to expand or modify our manufacturing capability in the future may be impeded by environmental regulation such air quality and wastewater requirement environmental law and regulation sometimes require to acquire additional pollution abatement or remediation equipment modify product design or incur other expense regulation in response to climate change could result in increased manufacturing cost associated with air pollution requirement and increased compliance and energy cost many new material that we are evaluating for use in our operation are subject to regulation under environmental law and regulation these restriction could harm our business and result of operation by increasing our expense or requiring to alter manufacturing and assembly and test process we are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risk we face risk related to cybersecurity threat and incident we regularly face attempt by others to gain unauthorized access through the internet or to introduce malicious software to our it system additionally individual or organization including malicious hacker state sponsored organization insider threat including employee and third party service provider or intruder into our physical facility at time attempt to gain unauthorized access and corrupt the process used to design and manufacture our hardware product and our associated software and service due to the widespread use of our product we are frequent target of computer hacker and organization that intend to sabotage take control of or otherwise corrupt our manufacturing or other process product and service we are also target of malicious attacker who attempt to gain access to our network or data center or those of our customer or end user steal proprietary information related to our business product employee and customer interrupt our system and service or those of our customer or others or demand ransom to return control of such system and service such attempt are increasing in number and in technical sophistication and if successful expose and the affected party to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary or confidential information or disruption of our business operation including our manufacturing operation our it infrastructure also includes product and service provided by third party and these provider can experience breach of their system and product that impact the security of our system and our proprietary or confidential information from time to time we encounter intrusion or unauthorized access to our network product service or infrastructure to date none have resulted in any material adverse impact to our business or operation such incident whether or not successful could result in our incurring significant cost related to for example rebuilding internal system writing down inventory value implementing additional threat protection measure providing modification to our product and service defending against litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage providing customer with incentive to maintain the business relationship or taking other remedial step with respect to third party well reputational harm in addition these threat are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measure while we seek to detect and investigate all unauthorized attempt and attack against our network product and service and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through change to our internal process and tool and change or update to our product and service we remain potentially vulnerable to additional known or unknown threat in some instance we our customer and the user of our product and service can be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect we face risk related to security vulnerability in our product we or third party regularly identify security vulnerability with respect to our processor and other product well the operating system and workload that run on them component and ip we purchase or license from third party for use in our product well industry standard specification we implement in our product are also regularly subject to security vulnerability we have become more data centric company our processor and other product are being used in additional and new critical application area that create new or increased cybersecurity and privacy risk including application that gather and process large amount of data such the cloud or internet of thing and critical infrastructure and automotive application the security vulnerability identified in our processor include category known side channel exploit such the variant referred to spectre and meltdown additional category and variant have been identified such the md and taa side channel variant and are expected to continue to be identified publicity about these and other security vulnerability ha resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased attempt by third party to identify additional vulnerability vulnerability are not always mitigated before they become known we our customer and the user of our product do not always promptly learn of or have the ability to fully ass the magnitude or effect of vulnerability including the extent if any to which vulnerability ha been exploited subsequent event or new information can develop that change our assessment of the impact of security vulnerability including additional information learned we develop and deploy mitigation or update become aware of additional variant evaluate the competitiveness of existing and new product and address future warranty or other claim or customer satisfaction consideration well development in the course of any litigation or regulatory inquiry or action over these matter other key information of contentsmitigation technique designed to address security vulnerability including software and firmware update or other preventative measure are not always available on timely basis or at all and at time do not operate intended or effectively resolve vulnerability for all application in addition we are often required to rely on third party including hardware software and service vendor well our customer and end user to develop and or deploy mitigation technique and the availability effectiveness and performance impact of mitigation technique can depend solely or in part on the action of these third party in determining whether and how to develop and deploy mitigation we and such third party may make prioritization decision about which vulnerability to address which can delay or limit development or deployment of mitigation and harm our reputation security vulnerability and or mitigation technique can result in adverse performance effect reboots system instability or unavailability loss of functionality data loss or corruption unpredictable system behavior decision by customer and end user to limit or change the application in which they use our product or product feature and or the misappropriation of data by third party security vulnerability and any limitation of or adverse effect resulting from mitigation technique can adversely affect our result of operation financial condition customer relationship prospect and reputation in number of way any of which may be material for example whether or not they involve attempted or successful exploit they may result in our incurring significant cost related to developing and deploying update and mitigation writing down inventory value defending against product claim and litigation responding to regulatory inquiry or action paying damage addressing customer satisfaction consideration providing product replacement or modification or taking other remedial step with respect to third party adverse publicity about security vulnerability or mitigation could damage our reputation with customer or user and reduce demand for our product and service these effect may be greater to the extent that competing product are not susceptible to the same vulnerability or if vulnerability can be more effectively mitigated in competing product moreover third party can release information regarding potential vulnerability of our product before mitigation are available which in turn could lead to attempted or successful exploit adversely affect our ability to introduce mitigation or otherwise harm our business and reputation for example information on the spectre and meltdown side channel variant wa prematurely reported publicly before mitigation technique to address all vulnerability were made widely available and certain of the mitigation technique did not operate intended theft loss or misuse of personal data about our employee customer or other third party could increase our expense damage our reputation or result in legal or regulatory proceeding the theft loss or misuse of personal data collected used stored or transferred by to run our business could result in significantly increased business and security cost or cost related to defending legal claim global privacy legislation enforcement and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating complex regulatory compliance environment cost to comply with and implement these privacy related and data protection measure could be significant and noncompliance could expose to significant monetary penalty damage to our reputation suspension of online service or site in certain country and even criminal sanction even our inadvertent failure to comply with federal state or international privacy related or data protection law and regulation could result in audit regulatory inquiry or proceeding against by governmental entity or other third party we are subject to ip risk and risk associated with litigation and regulatory proceeding we can not always enforce or protect our ip right we regard our patent copyright trade secret and other ip right important to the success of our business we rely on ip law well confidentiality and licensing agreement with our customer employee technology development partner and others to protect our ip right our ability to enforce these right is subject to general litigation risk well uncertainty to the enforceability of our ip right in various country we are not always able to enforce or protect our ip right enforcement is costly and time consuming and can divert management attention when we seek to enforce our right we may be subject to claim that our ip right are invalid not enforceable or licensed to an opposing party our assertion of ip right may result in another party seeking to assert claim against which could

pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we at time need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction that could help achieve our financial or strategic objective where an existing investment doe not meet our criterion for success we routinely evaluate opportunity for possible divestiture and other option we may not realize the anticipated benefit of divestiture due to risk that include unfavorable price and term change in market condition limitation due to regulatory or governmental approval contractual term or other condition and continued financial obligation or unanticipated liability associated with such transaction in some case we are not able to divest investment on acceptable term or at all any of these risk could have

overhead cost can be included in inventory based on the normal capacity of our manufacturing and assembly and test facility we apply our historical loading compared to our total available capacity in statistical model to determine our normal capacity level if the factory loading are below the established normal capacity level portion of our fixed production overhead cost would not be included in the cost of inventory instead it would be recognized cost of sale in that period we refer to these cost excess capacity charge excess capacity charge are insignificant in the year presented charge in year prior to those presented have ranged up to billion taken in connection with the economic recession financial statement note to financial of contentsinventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and market condition product specific fact and circumstance reviewed in the inventory valuation process include review of our customer base the stage of the product life cycle variation in market pricing and an assessment of selling price in relation to product cost lower of cost or net realizable value inventory reserve fluctuate we ramp new process technology with cost improving over time due to scale and improved yield additionally inventory valuation is impacted by cyclical change in market condition and the associated pricing environment the valuation of inventory also requires to estimate obsolete and excess inventory well inventory that is not of salable quality we use the demand forecast to develop our short term manufacturing plan to enable consistency between inventory valuation and build decision for certain new product we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecast we compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished good inventory level to determine the amount if any of obsolete or excess inventory when our demand forecast for specific product is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly we are required to write off inventory property plant and equipmentwe compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of asset we also capitalize interest on borrowing related to eligible capital expenditure capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified asset and depreciated together with that asset cost we record capital related government grant earned reduction to property plant and equipment we evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property plant and equipment considering factor such the process technology cadence between node transition change in machinery and equipment technology and re use of machinery and tool across each generation of process technology we make manufacturing process conversion and other factory planning decision we use assumption involving the use of management judgment regarding the remaining useful life of asset primarily process specific semiconductor manufacturing tool and building improvement when we determine that the useful life of asset are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the asset revised useful life asset are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow we ass property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset or the asset grouping may not be recoverable factor that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of business or product line in relation to expectation significant negative industry or economic trend and significant change or planned change in our use of the asset we measure the recoverability of asset that we will continue to use in our operation by comparing the carrying value of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future undiscounted net cash flow arising from the use of that asset grouping if an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired we measure the impairment by comparing the difference between the asset grouping carrying value and it fair value fair valuewhen determining fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact well assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability our financial asset are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis except for equity security measured using the measurement alternative equity method investment cost method loan receivable grant receivable and reverse repurchase agreement with original maturity greater than three month we ass fair value hierarchy level for our issued debt and fixed income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type the three level of input that may be used to measure fair value are level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability we evaluate security specific market data when determining whether market is active level observable input other than level price such quoted price for similar asset or liability quoted price in le active market or model derived valuation all significant input used in our valuation such discounted cash flow are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability we use libor based yield curve overnight indexed swap curve currency spot and forward rate and credit rating significant input in our valuation level input also include non binding market consensus price well quoted price that were adjusted for security specific restriction when we use non binding market consensus price we corroborate them with quoted market price for similar instrument or compare them to output from internally developed pricing model such discounted cash flow model level unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of asset or liability we monitor and review the input and result of these valuation model to help ensure the fair value measurement are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset class level input also include non binding market consensus price or non binding broker quote that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data financial statement note to financial of contentsdebt investmentswe consider all highly liquid debt investment with original maturity from the date of purchase of three month or le cash equivalent cash equivalent can include investment such corporate debt financial institution instrument government debt and reverse repurchase agreement marketable debt investment are generally designated trading asset when market risk is economically hedged at inception with related derivative instrument or when the marketable debt investment is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement investment designated trading asset are reported at fair value gain or loss on these investment arising from change in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuation and credit market volatility largely offset by loss or gain on the related derivative instrument and balance sheet remeasurement are recorded in interest and other net marketable debt investment are considered available for sale investment when the interest rate and foreign currency risk are not hedged at the inception of the investment or when our criterion for designation trading asset are not met available for sale debt investment with original maturity of approximately three month or le from the date of purchase are classified within cash and cash equivalent available for sale debt investment with original maturity at the date of purchase greater than approximately three month and remaining maturity of le than one year are classified short term investment available for sale debt investment with remaining maturity beyond one year are classified other long term investment available for sale debt investment are reported at fair value with unrealized gain or loss net of tax recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss we determine the cost of the investment sold based on an average cost basis at the individual security level and record the interest income and realized gain or loss on the sale of these investment in interest and other net our available for sale debt investment are subject to periodic impairment review for these investment we consider whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investment before recovery of it amortized cost basis or whether recovery of the entire amortized cost basis of the investment is unlikely because credit loss exists when we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the investment we separate other than temporary impairment into amount representing credit loss which are recognized in interest and other net and amount not related to credit loss which are recognized in other comprehensive income loss equity investmentswe regularly invest in equity security of public and private company to promote business and strategic objective equity investment are measured and recorded follows marketable equity security are equity security with rdfv that are measured and recorded at fair value on recurring basis with change in fair value whether realized or unrealized recorded through the income statement prior to these security were classified available for sale security and measured and recorded at fair value with unrealized change in fair value recorded through other comprehensive income non marketable equity security are equity security without rdfv that are measured and recorded using measurement alternative that measure the security at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from qualifying observable price change prior to fiscal these security were accounted for using the cost method of accounting measured at cost le other than temporary impairment equity method investment are equity security in investees we do not control but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence equity method investment are measured at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss our proportionate share of the income or loss from equity method investment is recognized on one quarter lag realized and unrealized gain and loss resulting from change in fair value or the sale of our equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net prior to we recorded unrealized gain and loss through other comprehensive income loss and realized gain and loss on the sale exchange or impairment of these equity investment through gain loss on equity investment net the carrying value of our non marketable equity security is adjusted for qualifying observable price change resulting from the issuance of similar or identical security by the same issuer determining whether an observed transaction is similar to security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the right and preference of the security recording upward and downward adjustment to the carrying value of our equity security result of observable price change requires quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security using various valuation methodology and involves the use of estimate non marketable equity security and equity method investment collectively referred to non marketable equity investment are also subject to periodic impairment review our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant impact on the investee fair value qualitative factor considered include the investee financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance market for technology operational and financing cash flow activity and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessment of the fair value of our non marketable equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others financial statement note to financial of content non marketable equity security are tested for impairment using qualitative model similar to the model used for goodwill and long lived asset upon determining that an impairment may exist the security fair value is calculated and compared to it carrying value and an impairment is recognized immediately if the carrying value exceeds the fair value prior to non marketable equity security were tested for impairment using the other than temporary impairment model equity method investment are subject to periodic impairment review using the other than temporary impairment model which considers the severity and duration of decline in fair value below cost and our ability and intent to hold the investment for sufficient period of time to allow for recovery impairment of equity investment are recorded in gain loss on equity investment net derivative financial instrumentsour primary objective for holding derivative financial instrument is to manage currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk and to lesser extent equity market risk commodity price risk and credit risk we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty master netting arrangement allows counterparties to net settle amount owed to each other result of multiple separate derivative transaction we also enter into collateral security arrangement with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instrument fluctuates from contractually established threshold we record the collateral within other current asset and other long term asset with corresponding liability for presentation on our consolidated balance sheet we do not offset fair value amount recognized for derivative instrument under master netting arrangement our derivative financial instrument are presented at fair value on gross basis and are included in other current asset other long term asset other accrued liability or other long term liability cash flow hedge use foreign currency contract such currency forward and currency interest rate swap to hedge exposure for the following item variability in the dollar equivalent of non dollar denominated cash flow associated with our forecasted operating and capital purchase spending and coupon and principal payment for our non dollar denominated indebtedness the after tax gain or loss from the effective portion of cash flow hedge is reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or period in which the hedged transaction affect earnings and in the same line item on the consolidated statement of income the impact of the hedge transaction for foreign currency contract hedging our capital purchase forward point are excluded from the hedge effectiveness assessment and are recognized in earnings in interest and other net if the cash flow hedge transaction become improbable the corresponding amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss would be immediately reclassified to interest and other net these derivative are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow in the same section the underlying item fair value hedge use interest rate contract such interest rate swap to hedge against change in the fair value on certain of our fixed rate indebtedness attributable to change in the benchmark interest rate the gain or loss on these hedge well the offsetting loss or gain related to the change in the fair value of the underlying hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings in the current period primarily in interest and other net these derivative are classified in the consolidated statement of cash flow in the same section the underlying item primarily within cash flow from financing activity non designated hedge use foreign currency contract to economically hedge the functional currency equivalent cash flow of recognized monetary asset and liability non dollar denominated debt instrument classified trading asset and non dollar denominated loan receivables recognized at fair value we also use interest rate contract to hedge interest rate risk related to our dollar denominated fixed rate debt instrument classified trading asset the change in fair value of these derivative is recorded through earnings in the line item on the consolidated statement of income to which the derivative most closely relate primarily in interest and other net change in the fair value of the underlying asset and liability associated with the hedged risk are generally offset by the change in the fair value of the related derivative loan receivablewe elect the fair value option when the interest rate or foreign currency exchange rate risk is economically hedged at the inception of the loan with related derivative instrument when the fair value option is not elected the loan are carried at amortized cost we measure interest income for all loan receivable using the interest method which is based on the effective yield of the loan rather than the stated coupon rate we classify our loan within other current and long term asset financial statement note to financial of contentscredit riskfinancial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist principally of investment in debt instrument derivative financial instrument loan receivable reverse repurchase agreement and trade receivables we enter into master netting arrangement to mitigate credit risk in derivative transaction by permitting net settlement of transaction with the same counterparty we generally place investment with high credit quality counterparties and by policy we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty based on our analysis of that counterparty relative credit standing required per our investment policy substantially all of our investment in debt instrument and financing receivables are in investment grade instrument credit rating criterion for derivative instrument are similar to those for other investment due to master netting arrangement the amount subject to credit risk related to derivative instrument are generally limited to the amount if any by which the counterparty obligation exceed our obligation with that counterparty of december our total credit exposure to any single counterparty excluding money market fund invested in treasury and agency security and reverse repurchase agreement collateralized by treasury and agency security did not exceed million to further reduce credit risk we obtain and secure available collateral from counterparties against obligation including security lending transaction when we deem it appropriate substantial majority of our trade receivables are derived from sale to oems and odms we also have account receivable derived from sale to industrial and communication equipment manufacturer in the computing and communication industry we believe the net account receivable balance from our three largest customer of december do not represent significant credit risk based on cash flow forecast balance sheet analysis and past collection experience for more information about the customer that represent our account receivable balance see note operating segment we have adopted credit policy and standard intended to accommodate industry growth and inherent risk we believe credit risk are moderated by the financial stability of our major customer we ass credit risk through quantitative and qualitative analysis from this analysis we establish shipping and credit limit and determine whether we will seek to use one or more credit support protection device such obtaining parent guarantee standby letter of credit or credit insurance business combinationswe allocate the purchase price paid for asset acquired and liability assumed in connection with our acquisition based on their estimated fair value at the time of acquisition this allocation involves number of assumption estimate and judgment in determining the fair value of the following intangible asset including the valuation methodology estimation of future cash flow discount rate market segment growth rate and our assumed market segment share well the estimated useful life of intangible asset deferred tax asset and liability uncertain tax position and tax related valuation allowance which are initially estimated of the acquisition date inventory property plant and equipment pre existing liability or legal claim deferred revenue and contingent consideration each may be applicable and goodwill measured the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair value of the asset acquired and the liability assumed our assumption and estimate are based upon comparable market data and information obtained from our management and the management of the acquired company we allocate goodwill to the reporting unit of the business that are expected to benefit from the business combination goodwillwe perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if indicator of potential impairment exist the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment the reporting unit carrying value used in an impairment test represents the assignment of various asset and liability excluding certain corporate asset and liability such cash investment and debt qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit additionally part of this assessment we may perform quantitative analysis to support the qualitative factor above by applying sensitivity to assumption and input used in measuring reporting unit fair value our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value significant estimate include market segment growth rate our assumed market segment share estimated cost and discount rate based on reporting unit weighted average cost of capital we test the reasonableness of the input and outcome of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data in the current year the fair value for all of our reporting unit substantially exceeds their carrying value and our annual qualitative assessment did not indicate that more detailed quantitative analysis wa necessary financial statement note to financial of contentsidentified intangible assetswe amortize acquisition related intangible asset that are subject to amortization over their estimated useful life acquisition related in process asset represent the fair value of incomplete project that had not reached technological feasibility of the date of acquisition initially these are classified in process and are not subject to amortization once these project are completed the asset balance are transferred from in process to acquisition related developed technology and are subject to amortization from this point forward the asset balance relating to project that are abandoned after acquisition are impaired and expensed to we perform quarterly review of significant finite lived identified intangible asset to determine whether fact and circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable these review can be affected by various factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our forecast for specific product line employee equity incentive planswe use the straight line amortization method to recognize share based compensation expense over the service period of the award net of estimated forfeiture upon exercise cancellation forfeiture or expiration of stock option or upon vesting or forfeiture of rsus we eliminate deferred tax asset for option and rsus with multiple vesting date for each vesting period on first in first out basis if each vesting period were separate award income taxeswe compute the provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we measure deferred tax asset and liability using the currently enacted tax rate that apply to taxable income in effect for the year in which those tax asset are expected to be realized or settled we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet recovery of portion of our deferred tax asset is affected by management plan with respect to holding or disposing of certain investment therefore such change could also affect our future provision for tax we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if based on the technical merit of the position it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authority the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are measured based on the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement we recognize interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit within the provision for tax on the consolidated statement of income we recognize the tax impact of including certain foreign earnings in taxable income period cost we have recognized deferred income tax for local country income and withholding tax that could be incurred on distribution of certain non earnings or for outside basis difference in our subsidiary because we do not plan to indefinitely reinvest such earnings and basis difference remittance of non earnings are based on estimate and judgment of projected cash flow need well the working capital and investment requirement of our non and operation material change in our estimate of cash working capital and investment need in various jurisdiction could require repatriation of indefinitely reinvested non earnings which could be subject to applicable non income and withholding tax loss contingencieswe are subject to loss contingency including various legal and regulatory proceeding asserted and potential claim liability related to repair or replacement of part in connection with product defect well product warranty and potential asset impairment that arise in the ordinary course of business an estimated loss from such contingency is recognized charge to income if it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated note recent accounting standardsaccounting standard adoptedleasesstandard description this new lease accounting standard requires
