consumer financial product regulation in the united state our marketing sale and servicing of consumer financial product and our compliance with certain federal consumer financial law are supervised and examined by the cfpb which ha broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over provider of credit saving and payment service and product and authority to prevent unfair deceptive or abusive act or practice in addition number of state have significant consumer credit protection disclosure and other law in certain case more stringent than federal law federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practice which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief law can affect our ability to collect amount owed to or subject to regulatory scrutiny internal and regulatory review to ass compliance with such law and regulation have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in change to our practice product and procedure restitution to our card member and increased cost related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination such review may also result in additional regulatory action including civil money penalty these type of review are likely to be continuing focus for the cfpb and regulator more broadly well for the company for example in august we announced that certain of our subsidiary signed consent order with the cfpb to resolve issue related to previously disclosed internal review of our card product offering in puerto rico the virgin island and other territory an issuer of stored value prepaid product we are regulated in the united state under the money transmitter or sale of check law in effect in most state we are also required by the law of many state to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property law under which we must pay to state the face amount of any traveler cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after period of time depending on the type of product in country outside the united state we have seen an increase in regulatory focus in relation to number of key area impacting our card issuing business particularly consumer protection such the european union eu the united kingdom and canada and responsible lending such australia mexico new zealand and singapore regulator in number of country are shifting their focus from ensuring compliance with local rule and regulation toward paying greater attention to the product design and operation with focus on customer and outcome regulator expectation of firm in relation to their compliance risk and control framework continue to increase and regulator are placing significant emphasis on firm system and control relating to the identification and resolution of issue table of content payment regulation legislator and regulator in various country in which we operate have focused on the operation of card network including through antitrust action legislation and regulation to change certain practice or pricing of card issuer merchant acquirer and payment network and in some case to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regime for payment system the eu australia and other jurisdiction have focused on the fee merchant pay to accept card including the way bankcard network member collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party network like visa and mastercard well the rule contract term and practice governing merchant card acceptance in some case such regulation extends to certain aspect of our business even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fee can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decrease in competitor pricing in connection with cap on interchange fee antitrust action and government regulation relating to merchant pricing or term of merchant rule and contract can also adversely impact consumer and merchant among other thing lower interchange and or merchant discount revenue can lead card issuer to look to reduce cost by scaling back or eliminating reward service or benefit to cardholder merchant and other customer or to look for other source of revenue including from consumer through higher annual card fee or interest charge in various country such certain member state in the eu and australia merchant are permitted by law to surcharge card purchase in addition the law of number of state in the united state that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant group surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have material adverse effect on if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impact american express card member which is known differential surcharging in addition other steering practice that are permitted by regulation in some country could also have material adverse effect on if they become widespread and disproportionately impact american express card member in canada regulator have prompted the major international card network to make voluntary commitment on pricing specifically interchange fee level american express doe not operate with interchange fee in the case of american express our commitment extends to maintaining current pricing practice whereby issuer rate received by gns partner are agreed to bilaterally with each partner rather than multilaterally and merchant pricing is simple transparent and value based with the rate for the acquiring of credit and charge card transaction for particular merchant regardless of the type of card that is presented regulator may seek to change the commitment in canada in the future in some country government have established regulatory regime that require international card network to be locally licensed and or to localize aspect of their operation for example card network operator in india must obtain authorization from the reserve bank of india which ha broad power under the payment and settlement system act to regulate the membership and operation of card network in hong kong the local monetary authority ha implemented new regulatory framework under which card payment system including american express have been designated for supervision in russia card network operator must be authorized by the central bank and regulation requires network to place security deposit with the central bank process all local transaction using government owned infrastructure and ensure that local transaction data remains within the country government in some country also provide resource or protection to select domestic payment card network for example china adopted new regulation that will permit foreign card network to operate domestically in the country for the first time subject to licensing capital and other requirement the development and enforcement of these and other similar law regulation and policy in international market may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in such country and maintain and extend our global network european union payment legislation in the eu adopted legislation in two part covering wide range of topic across the payment industry the first part wa an eu wide regulation on interchange fee the interchange fee regulation the second consisted of the revised payment service directive the among other thing the interchange fee regulation cap interchange fee on consumer card transaction in the eu generally at basis point for debit and prepaid card and basis point for credit and charge card with the possibility of lower cap in some instance the interchange fee regulation excludes commercial card transaction from the scope of the cap although the discount rate we agree to with merchant are not capped the interchange cap have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressure on merchant fee across the industry including our discount rate the interchange fee regulation provides that three party network such american express should be subject to the interchange fee cap when they license third party provider to issue card and or acquire merchant in ruling issued on february the eu court of justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee cap provision well other provision in circumstance where three party network issue card with cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling give only limited guidance to when or how the provision might apply in such circumstance table of content the interchange fee regulation also prohibits with some exception anti steering and honor all card rule across all card network including non discrimination and honor all card provision in our card acceptance agreement the absence of these provision in our card acceptance agreement in the eu creates significant risk of customer confusion and card member dissatisfaction which would result in harm to the american express brand the make revision to the original payment service directive psd adopted in and prescribes common rule across the eu for licensing and supervision of payment service provider including card issuer and merchant acquirer and for their conduct of business with customer member state until january to transpose the into national law under the psd member state could choose to permit or prohibit surcharging and under the consumer right directive merchant were prohibited from surcharging consumer purchase more than the merchant cost of acceptance of given mean of payment the includes an outright ban on surcharging for those transaction falling in scope of the interchange fee regulation with an option for individual member state to prohibit surcharging altogether some member state such france and italy have chosen to exercise the option meaning that surcharging is banned altogether in other member state such germany and denmark card not subject to the interchange fee regulation card issued by three party network like american express and commercial card can still be surcharged up to the cost of acceptance the uk ha chosen to ban surcharging altogether on consumer card but allows surcharging on commercial card up to the cost of acceptance the revised surcharging rule may increase instance of differential surcharging of our card customer and merchant confusion to which transaction may be surcharged and lead to card member dissatisfaction the also requires all network including three party network that operate with licensing arrangement such our gns business to establish objective proportionate and non discriminatory criterion under which financial institution may access the network for example licensed issuer or acquirer the combined impact of the interchange fee regulation and the imposes regulatory burden on our gns business that render it no longer viable result we have shifted our focus to our proprietary card issuing business in the eu and will not issue new gns license there in addition we have terminated the license with our existing gns partner in the eu and are in the process of winding those operation australia payment regulation under regulation adopted by the reserve bank of australia in the interchange fee paid on visa and mastercard credit transaction well the payment we make to gns partner must not exceed weighted average benchmark of percent across all transaction with maximum interchange fee cap of percent for each individual credit card transaction the inclusion of our gns business under interchange regulation ha undermined our ability to attract and retain gns partner in australia while the discount rate we agree to with merchant are not capped the interchange cap have exerted and will likely continue to exert downward pressure on merchant fee across the industry including our discount rate the regulation also changed the rule on merchant surcharging to limit surcharging to the actual cost of card acceptance paid to the merchant acquirer recorded on the merchant statement issued by the merchant acquirer privacy data protection information and cyber security regulatory and legislative activity

event or circumstance could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operation these event could also have negative effect on the trading price of our security strategic business and competitive risk difficult condition in the business and economic environment well political condition in the united state and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and result of operation our result of operation are materially affected by economic market political and social condition in the united state and abroad we offer broad array of product and service to consumer small business and commercial client and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing product slow economic growth or deterioration in economic condition could change customer behavior including spending on our card and the ability and willingness of card member to borrow and pay amount owed to political condition in certain region or country could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including in other part of the world factor such consumer spending and confidence unemployment rate business investment government spending interest rate tax including the broad and complex change made by the tax cut and job act to the tax code fuel and other energy cost the volatility and strength of the capital market inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability such factor may also cause our earnings billing loan balance credit metric and margin to fluctuate and diverge from expectation of analyst and investor who may have differing assumption regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting and or increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common share table of content travel and entertainment expenditure which comprised approximately percent of our billed business during for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending level and tend to decline during general economic downturn likewise spending by small business and corporate client which comprised approximately percent of our worldwide billed business during depends in part on the economic environment and favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation increase in delinquency and write off rate result of increase in bankruptcy unemployment rate change in customer behavior or otherwise could also have negative impact on our result of operation the consequence of negative circumstance impacting or the environment generally can be sudden and severe our operating result may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payment industry the payment industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card network issuer and acquirer paper based transaction cash and check bank transfer model wire transfer and ach well evolving and growing alternative non traditional payment and financing provider we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most country result card issuer and acquirer on the visa and mastercard network may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resource marketing and pricing of those network our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase merchant acceptance and our card are not accepted at merchant that accept card on the visa and mastercard network some of our competitor have developed or may develop for example result of the recent reduction in the corporate tax rate substantially greater financial and other resource than we have and may offer richer value proposition or wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategy to acquire and retain more customer capture greater share of spending and borrowing establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner program and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat or respond or adapt to change in consumer spending habit effectively our competitor we expect expense such card member reward and card member service expense to continue to increase we improve our value proposition for card member including in response to increased competition spending on our card could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit card issued on other network well adoption of alternative payment system to the extent other payment mechanism system and product continue to successfully expand our discount revenue and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated network could be negatively impacted the competitive value of our closed loop data may also be diminished traditional and non traditional competitor use other new data source and technology to derive similar insight if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor develop compelling value proposition for our customer and or effectively grow in area such mobile and online payment and emerging technology we may not be able to compete effectively to the extent we expand into new business area and new geographic region we may face competitor with more experience and more established relationship with relevant customer regulator and industry participant which could adversely affect our ability to compete we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business area and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resource to comply with regulatory requirement than our competitor particularly those that are not regulated financial institution in addition company that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choice through digital wallet commerce related experience mobile application or other technology or at the point of sale could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our product or could restrict our access to our customer and transaction data such company could also require payment from to participate in such digital wallet experience or application impacting our profitability on transaction law and business practice that favor local competitor require card transaction to be routed over domestic network or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain business could slow our growth in international region further expanding our service offering adding customer acquisition channel and forming new partnership could have higher cost than our current arrangement and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand many of our competitor are subject to different and in some case le stringent legislative and regulatory regime more restrictive law and regulation that do not apply to all of our competitor can put at competitive disadvantage including prohibiting from engaging in certain transaction regulating our contract term and practice governing merchant card acceptance or adversely affecting our cost structure see ongoing legal proceeding regarding provision in our merchant contract could have material adverse effect on our business result in additional litigation and or arbitration subject to substantial monetary damage and damage our reputation and brand for discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively if ongoing legal proceeding limit our ability to prevent merchant from engaging in various action to discriminate against our card product table of content we face substantial and increasingly intense competition for partner relationship which could result in loss or renegotiation of these arrangement that could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different type of contractual arrangement with business partner in variety of industry for example we have partnered with delta air line well many others globally to offer cobranded card for consumer and small business and through our membership reward program we have partnered with business in many industry including the airline industry to offer benefit to card member participant competition for relationship with key business partner is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationship or that they will remain profitable establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnership is particularly competitive among card issuer and network these partnership typically appeal to high spending loyal customer our entire cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december card member loan related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide card member loan of december delta cobrand account our largest cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december and approximately percent of worldwide card member loan of december our relationship with and revenue related to delta extend beyond cobrand account and include merchant acceptance of american express card participation in our membership reward program and travel related benefit and service cobrand arrangement are entered into for fixed period generally ranging from five to eight year and will terminate in accordance with their term including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the party or upon early termination result of an event of default or otherwise we face the risk that we could lose partner relationship even after we have invested significant resource in the relationship the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationship in addition some of our cobrand arrangement provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate third party to purchase the loan generated with respect to it program which could result in significant decline in our card member loan outstanding for example our cobrand relationship with costco ended in and we sold the outstanding card member loan associated with the costco portfolio we also face the risk that existing relationship will be renegotiated with le favorable term for competition for such relationship continues to increase we make payment to our cobrand partner which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding reward earned on such spending and under certain arrangement on the number of account acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partner ha increased particularly in the united state and may continue to increase arrangement are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partner among card issuer and network we may also choose to not continue certain cobrand relationship the loss of exclusivity arrangement with business partner or the loss of business partner altogether whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such the end of our relationship with costco in the united state in or the result of merger or otherwise such the withdrawal of american airline in from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card member or the renegotiation of existing partnership with term that are significantly worse for could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partner could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card member and merchant and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partner we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the price we charge merchant that accept our card for payment for good and service unlike our competitor in the payment industry that rely on revolving credit balance to drive profit our business model is focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fee generally charged to merchant when card member use their card to purchase good and service on our network is primarily driven by billed business volume and is our largest single revenue source in recent year we experienced some reduction in our global weighted average merchant discount rate and have been under increasing pressure including result of regulatory mandated reduction to competitor pricing to reduce merchant discount rate and undertake other repricing initiative we also face pressure from competitor that have other source of income or lower cost that can make their pricing more attractive to key business partner and merchant merchant are also able to negotiate incentive and pricing concession from condition to accepting our card or being cobrand partner merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentive and or concession we provide to certain merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive we also expect further erosion of our average merchant discount rate we seek to increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volume at new merchant in addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment model and technology from non traditional player in the alternative payment space could pose challenge to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate some merchant continue to invest in their own payment solution such proprietary branded mobile wallet using both traditional and new technology platform if merchant are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volume table of content continuing priority of is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchant which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial result if the average merchant discount rate decline more than expected we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing billed business volume increasing other source of revenue such fee based revenue or interest income or both we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rate or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rate particularly in the current regulatory environment which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added service for merchant and card member surcharging or steering by merchant could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation in certain country such australia and certain member state in the eu merchant are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchase in addition the law of number of state in the united state that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant group in jurisdiction allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on american express card in certain merchant category and in some case either the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard card or visa and mastercard card are not surcharged at all practice that are known differential surcharging even though there are many card issued on competing network that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant we also encounter merchant that accept our card but tell their customer that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our card our card member value the ability to use their card where and when they want to and we therefore take step to meet our card member expectation and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirement if surcharging steering or other form of discrimination become widespread american express card and credit and charge card generally could become le desirable to consumer which could result in decrease in card in force and transaction volume the impact could vary depending on such factor the manner in which surcharge is levied how card member are steered to other card product or payment form at the point of sale and whether and to what extent these action are applied to other payment card including whether it varies depending on the type of card network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express card could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation particularly to the extent it disproportionately impact our card member if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological development across all our business our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest across all area of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics customer interaction and communication alternative payment mechanism authentication technology and risk management and compliance system incorporating new technology into our product and service may require substantial expenditure and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technology in the payment industry will continue to emerge and these new technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service the process of developing new product and service enhancing existing product and service and adapting to technological change and evolving industry standard is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technological trend accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is key competitive factor and our competitor may develop product platform or technology that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new product and service before they generate material revenue if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technology or business process on acceptable term may also be limited by intellectual property right that third party including competitor and potential competitor may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technology may be inhibited by need for industry wide standard changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card member or merchant or the complexity of our system table of content we may not be successful in our effort to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member reward and service or to effectively control the cost of such investment both of which may impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our card and growing loan balance we have been investing in number of growth initiative over the past several year including to attract new card member reduce card member attrition and capture greater share of customer total spending and borrowing there can be no assurance that our investment to acquire card member provide differentiated feature and service and increase usage of our card will be effective for example we may not be successful in developing and issuing new and enhanced card or customer may not accept or be willing to pay for our new product and service which would negatively impact our result of operation in addition if we develop new product or offer that attract customer looking for short term incentive rather than incentivize long term loyalty card member attrition and cost could increase increasing spending on our card also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our card if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or revers itself our business could suffer another way we invest in customer value is through our membership reward program well other card member benefit any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemption of membership reward point and associated redemption cost could adversely affect our profitability in addition many credit card issuer have instituted reward and cobrand program and may introduce program and service that are similar to or more attractive than ours our inability to continue to differentiate our product and service generally could materially adversely affect we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefit including containing the growth of marketing promotion reward and card member service expense in the future if such expense continue to increase beyond our expectation we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume increasing other area of revenue such fee based revenue or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key asset of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and it attribute are key asset and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card member and corporate client is highly dependent upon the external perception of our level of service trustworthiness business practice management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition our response to unexpected event and other subjective quality negative perception or publicity regarding these matter even if related to seemingly isolated incident and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card member and corporate client which could make it difficult for to attract new card member and customer and maintain existing one negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activity or circumstance including card practice regulatory compliance and the use and protection of customer information and from action taken by regulator or others in response to such conduct social medium channel can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by action taken by third party that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of or controversy related to third party vendor merchant acquirer or gns partner may be attributed by card member and merchant to thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance or suppression of card usage by merchant can also negatively impact perception of our brand and our product lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment product or system adverse development with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against furthermore corporation with headquarters and operation located in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor development for area of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perception or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability significant operating disruption major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit card we and other third party process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit card and prepaid and other product and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volume of certain type of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customer and employee table of content global financial institution like have experienced significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent year and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer virus malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attack including phishing and impersonation hacking denial of service attack and other attack and similar disruption from the unauthorized use of or access to computer system for example we and other financial service provider have been the target of distributed denial of service attack from sophisticated third party our network and system are subject to constant attempt to identify and exploit potential vulnerability in our operating environment with intent to disrupt our business operation and capture destroy or manipulate various type of information relating to corporate trade secret customer information including card member travel and loyalty program account information employee information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity financial result and intellectual property there are number of motivation for cyber threat actor including criminal activity such fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nation state espionage political agenda public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology system and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerability in corporate system and website outsourcing specialization of function third party digital service and technology innovation within the payment industry increase including with respect to mobile technology tokenization big data and cloud storage solution more third party are involved in processing card transaction and there is risk the confidentiality integrity privacy and or security of data held by or accessible to third party including merchant that accept our card payment processor and our business partner may be compromised which could lead to unauthorized transaction on our card and cost associated with responding to such an incident in addition high profile data breach such the one announced in by equifax one of the three major credit reporting agency in the united state could change consumer behavior impact our ability to access data to make product offer and credit decision and result in legislation and additional regulatory requirement we develop and maintain system and process aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incident and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating technology and regulatory requirement change and effort to overcome security measure become more sophisticated despite our effort the possibility of information and cyber security incident malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activity and human error or malfeasance can not be eliminated entirely risk associated with each of these remain including the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary or other information including account data information or negative impact to online account and system these risk will likely evolve new technology is deployed for example with the increased use of emv technology we may see decrease in traditional fraud risk but sophisticated fraudsters may develop new way to commit fraud and we may see an increase in online fraud and impersonation and identity takeover attempt our information technology system including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement system and data center may experience service disruption or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increase in customer transaction volume natural disaster accident power outage internet outage telecommunication failure fraud denial of service and other cyberattacks terrorism computer virus physical or electronic break in or similar event service disruption could prevent access to our online service and account information compromise company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed country could also result in service disruption which could impact our ability to do business in those country if our information technology system experience significant disruption or breach or if actual or perceived fraud level or other illegal activity involving our card customer online account or system were to rise due to an information or cyber security incident at business partner merchant or other market participant employee error malfeasance or otherwise it could lead to the loss of data or data integrity regulatory investigation and intervention such mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation and response cost greater concern of customer and or business partner relating to the privacy and security of their data and reputational and financial damage to our brand which could reduce the use and acceptance of our card and have material adverse impact on our business if such disruption or breach are not detected quickly their effect could be compounded information or cyber security incident and other actual or perceived failure to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security including leaked business data may also disrupt our operation undermine our competitive advantage through the disclosure of sensitive company information divert management attention and resource and negatively impact the assessment of and our subsidiary by banking regulator and rating agency successful cyberattacks or data breach at other large financial institution large retailer or other market participant whether or not we are impacted could lead to general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measure or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our product and service although we have insurance for loss related to cyber risk and attack and information and cyber security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of material loss event table of content we have agreement with business partner in variety of industry including the airline industry that represent significant portion of our business we are exposed to risk associated with these industry including bankruptcy liquidation restructurings consolidation and alliance of our partner and the possible obligation to make payment to our partner we may be obligated to make or accelerate payment to certain business

reimburse card member for product and service purchased from merchant that have ceased operation or stopped accepting our card we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry which accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december to the extent we protect card member against non delivery of good and service such where we have remitted payment to an airline for card member purchase of ticket that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member for additional information relating to the general risk related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline industry under md we may not be successful in realizing the benefit associated with our acquisition strategic alliance joint venture and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted we have acquired number of business and have made number of strategic investment and continue to evaluate potential transaction these transaction could be material to our financial condition and result of operation there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidate on term and condition that are acceptable to or complete proposed acquisition and investment which could impair our growth the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure result in unanticipated liability and harm our business generally it may take longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefit of these transaction and those benefit may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating result including result of write down of goodwill and other intangible asset we may also face risk with other type of strategic transaction such the sale to incomm of the operation relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business in the united state which is still subject to final agreement on the program management and issuer processing arrangement if that transaction is consummated we could experience disruption in our ability to service our prepaid customer if incomm service are interrupted

party may act in way that could harm our business we rely on third party service provider merchant customer acquisition channel processor aggregator gns partner and other third party for service that are integral to our operation and are subject to the risk that activity of such third party may adversely affect our business for example we rely on third party for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of service to our customer if service provider or other third party cease to provide the data quality or communication capacity we expect or service upon which we rely result of natural disaster operational disruption or error terrorism information or cyber security incident or any other reason the failure could interrupt or

development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another to the extent that different regulatory system impose overlapping or inconsistent requirement on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional cost in our compliance effort if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirement or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital action such declaring dividend or repurchasing outstanding share or engage in certain activity or acquisition additionally our banking regulator have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statute and regulation and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activity or acquisition or require to maintain more capital in recent year legislator and regulator have focused on the operation of card network including interchange fee paid to card issuer in payment network such visa and mastercard and the fee merchant are charged to accept card even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fee can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decrease in competitor pricing in connection with cap on interchange fee in some case regulation extend to certain aspect of our business such gns and cobrand arrangement or term of card acceptance for merchant including term relating to non discrimination and honor all card for example regulation in the eu and australia have undermined our gns business in those jurisdiction and have resulted in the moderation of gns billed business growth in addition there is uncertainty to when or how interchange fee cap provision and other provision might apply when we work with cobrand partner and agent in the eu following ruling from the eu court of justice and there can be no

included claim for substantial compensatory or punitive damage while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreement with customer to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future the continued focus of merchant on issue relating to the acceptance of various form of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal action given the inherent uncertainty involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damage sought in some matter asserted against there is significant uncertainty to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matter we have been subject to regulatory action by the cfpb and other regulator and may continue to be

subject to significant fine penalty or other requirement resulting in card member reimbursement increased expense limitation or condition on our business activity and damage to our reputation and our

institution for example the basel committee finalized revision to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirement if these revision are adopted in the united state we could be required to hold significantly more capital result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our result of operation is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset level could lower our return on equity part of our required stress testing both internally and by the federal reserve we must continue to comply with applicable capital standard calculated under the standardized approach in the adverse and severely adverse economic scenario published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirement it may be necessary for to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rule compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rule including the capital rule and the lcr requires material investment of

of stressed market environment if the federal reserve object to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirement our ability to undertake capital action may be restricted in addition the capital rule include capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer which is currently set at zero but which could be increased by the federal reserve in the future these buffer can be satisfied only with capital if our risk based capital ratio were to fall below the applicable buffer level we would be subject to certain restriction on dividend stock repurchase and other capital distribution well discretionary bonus payment to executive officer failure to increase dividend along with our competitor or any reduction of or elimination of our common stock dividend

middle market and small business customer while large and global commercial customer grew at more modest pace global network service billed business grew at slower rate over the year than our proprietary business result of the impact of the evolving regulatory environment in europe and australia revenue net of interest expense grew year over year primarily due to growth in billed business net interest income and net card fee partially offset by an expected decline in the average discount rate our net interest yield increased year over year primarily related to shift in mix over time

credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our global commercial service global merchant service gns prepaid service and foreign exchange service business well investment and liquidity management activity unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic condition and by client specific event the absence of large loss in any given year or over several year is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolio given the infrequency of

exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign customer and counterparties and measure and manage concentration of risk by geographic region well by economic sector and industry primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weakness in economic and fiscal profile we evaluate country based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk of december we considered our gross credit exposure to government entity financial institution and corporation in those

are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policy and committee and properly reflected in all decision escalated to the ermc market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability value resulting from movement in market price our market risk exposure include interest rate risk due to change in the relationship between interest rate on our asset such loan receivables and investment security and our interest rate on our liability such debt and deposit and foreign exchange risk related to transaction funding investment and earnings in currency

other regulatory requirement market risk management is also guided and governed by policy covering the use of derivative financial instrument funding liquidity and investment we analyze variety of interest rate scenario to inform of the potential impact from interest rate change on earnings and the value of asset liability and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time result of among other thing the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposit compared to our card member loan and receivables interest rate swap are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuance to or from variable rate from or to fixed rate we do not engage in derivative financial instrument for trading purpose other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payment business activity refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our derivative financial instrument table of content of december hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rate would have detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately million this measure first project net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rate the detrimental impact from rate increase is measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rate by basis point it is further assumed that our interest rate sensitive asset and the majority of our liability that reprice within the twelve month horizon generally reprice by basis point our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liability reprice at lower magnitude than benchmark rate movement consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual change in our net interest income will depend on many factor and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to change in market interest rate in addition to parallel rate change our net interest income is subject to change in the relationship between market benchmark rate for example movement in prime rate change the yield on large portion of our variable rate lending receivables and loan while libor rate determine the effective interest rate on significant portion of our outstanding funding difference in the rate of change of these two benchmark index commonly referred to basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of hypothetical basis point decrease in the spread between prime and one month libor over the next twelve month is estimated to be million we currently have approximately billion of prime based variable rate lending receivables and loan and billion of libor indexed debt including asset securitizations the replacement of libor benchmark rate can have further detrimental impact on our libor indexed debt if rate suddenly rise new market activity transfer to other benchmark curve such the secured overnight financing rate foreign exchange exposure arise in four principal way card member spending in currency that are not the billing currency cross currency transaction and balance from our funding activity cross currency investing activity such in the equity of foreign subsidiary and revenue generated and expense incurred in foreign currency which impact earnings these foreign exchange risk are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transaction or hedged with foreign exchange forward contract when the hedge cost are economically justified and in notional amount designed to offset pretax impact from currency movement in the period in which they occur of december and foreign currency derivative instrument with total notional amount of approximately billion and billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transaction including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balance including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity of december with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currency the adverse impact on pretax income of hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar related to anticipated overseas operating result for the next twelve month would be approximately million of december to much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activity conducted by our foreign exchange international payment business we aim to minimize market risk from these activity through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limit to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate change will depend on among other factor the timing of rate change the extent to which different rate do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree change in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activity and change in the volume and mix of our business funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligation they become due at reasonable cost our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guide and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to diverse set of cash readily marketable security and contingent source of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirement and expected future financing obligation for at least twelve month period even in the event we are unable to raise new fund under our regular funding program during substantial weakening in economic condition we consider the trade offs between maintaining much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during liquidity event liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level well at certain subsidiary in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resource are maintained the funding and liquidity committee review forecast of our aggregate and subsidiary cash position and financing requirement approves funding plan designed to satisfy those requirement under normal and stressed condition establishes guideline to identify the amount of liquidity resource required and monitor position and determines any action to be taken table of content model risk management process we define model risk the risk of adverse consequence such financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decision based on incorrect or misused model output and report we manage model risk through comprehensive model governance framework including policy and procedure for model development independent model validation and change management capability that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology output and misuse we also ass model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objective due to poor strategic decision including decision related to merger acquisition and divestiture poor implementation of strategic decision or declining demand for our product and service strategic decision are reviewed and approved by business leader and various committee and must be aligned with company policy we seek to manage strategic and business risk through risk control embedded in these process well overall risk management oversight over business goal existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committee and business leader merger acquisition and divestiture can only be approved following deal committee due diligence comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leader provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committee all new product and material change in business process are reviewed and approved by the new product committee and appropriate credit or risk committee table of content critical accounting estimate refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for summary of our significant accounting policy certain of our accounting policy requiring significant management assumption and judgment are follows reserve for card member loss reserve for card member loss represent our best estimate of the probable loss inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member loan and receivables of the balance sheet date in estimating these loss we use statistical and analytical model that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative component of the reserve the model take into account several factor including delinquency based loss migration rate loss emergence period and average loss over an appropriate historical period well expected future recovery we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factor that may increase or decrease the reserve for loss on card member loan and receivables the process of estimating these reserve requires high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factor such environmental trend is not indicative of future performance actual loss could differ significantly from our judgment and expectation resulting in either higher or lower future provision for card member loss in any quarter of december percent increase in our estimate of loss inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loan and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserve for loss with corresponding change to provision for loss by approximately million this sensitivity analysis is provided hypothetical scenario to ass the sensitivity of the provision for loss it doe not represent our expectation for loss in the future nor doe it include how other portfolio factor such delinquency based loss migration rate or recovery or the amount of outstanding balance may impact the level of reserve for loss and the corresponding impact on the provision for loss liability for membership reward expense the membership reward program is our largest card based reward program card member can earn point for purchase charged on their enrolled card product significant portion of our card by their term allow card member to earn bonus point for purchase at merchant in particular industry category membership reward point are redeemable for broad variety of reward including travel shopping gift card and covering eligible charge point typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of point card member may earn membership reward expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled card customer participation in the program and contractual arrangement with redemption partner we record membership reward liability that represents the estimated cost of point earned that are expected to be redeemed by card member in the future the membership reward liability is impacted over time by enrollment level attrition the volume of point earned and redeemed and the associated redemption cost we estimate the membership reward liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the point of current enrollee refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of point earned by current enrollee that will ultimately be redeemed in future period we use statistical and actuarial model to estimate the urr of point earned to date by current card member based on redemption trend card product type enrollment tenure card spend level and credit attribute the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption cost and is primarily based on redemption choice made by card member reward offering by partner and membership reward program change the wac per point is derived from the previous month of redemption and is adjusted appropriate for certain change in redemption cost that are not representative of future cost expectation we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumption based on development in redemption pattern cost per point redeemed partner contract change and other factor the process of estimating the membership reward liability includes high degree of judgment actual redemption and associated redemption cost could differ significantly from our estimate resulting in either higher or lower membership reward expense change in the membership reward urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period marketing promotion reward and card member service expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all point previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollee of the end of the reporting period of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollee of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million table of content fair value measurement our investment security and derivative instrument are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet which require management to make assumption and apply judgment when assessing fair value the objective of fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability by utilizing the three level hierarchy of input to valuation technique used to measure fair value when available we use quoted market price to determine fair value level if quoted market price are not available we will measure fair value based on pricing model with significant observable input level we do not have any financial instrument measured at fair value on recurring basis using significant unobservable input level for additional information on our fair value hierarchy refer to note to the consolidated financial statement investment security our investment security are mostly composed of fixed income security issued by state and municipality in the united state the government and it agency and select foreign government the fair value of our investment security including investment comprising defined benefit pension plan asset are obtained primarily from third party pricing service the fair value provided by the pricing service are estimated using pricing model where the input to those model are based on observable market input or recent trade of similar security we did not apply any adjustment to price received from the pricing service used of december and for additional information on our investment security refer to note to the consolidated financial statement derivative instrument our primary derivative instrument are interest rate swap and foreign currency forward agreement the fair value of our derivative instrument is estimated internally by using third party pricing model where the input to those model are readily observable from actively quoted market for additional information on our derivative and hedging activity refer to note to the consolidated financial statement in the measurement of fair value for our investment security and derivative instrument although the underlying input used in the pricing model are based on observable market input the pricing model do entail certain amount of subjectivity and therefore differing judgment in the underlying input or how they are modeled could result in different estimate of fair value while we rely on the third party pricing model we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation technique at least annually and validate the valuation output on quarterly basis goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when event or circumstance arise such adverse change in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below it carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factor in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount the qualitative factor may include but are not limited to economic condition industry and market consideration cost factor overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit specific event if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting unit which inherently entail the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use combination of the income approach discounted cash flow and market approach market multiple in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit when preparing discounted cash flow model under the income approach we estimate future cash flow using the reporting unit internal multi year forecast and terminal value calculated using growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic condition to discount these cash flow we use our expected cost of equity determined using capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded company multiple earnings revenue to our reporting unit actual result the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flow discount rate and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting unit we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating result or macroeconomic condition differ significantly from management current assumption table of content income tax we are subject to the income tax law of the united state it state and municipality and those of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing provision for income tax expense we must make judgment about the application of inherently complex tax law in particular the tax act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provision to estimate the impact on our income tax expense the estimate are based on the information available and our current interpretation of the tax act and may change due to change in interpretation and assumption we make and additional guidance or context from the internal revenue service the treasury department the financial accounting standard board or others regarding the tax act our accounting for the impact of the tax act is provisional and actual income tax expense could differ from our estimate refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information unrecognized tax benefit we establish liability for unrecognized tax benefit which are the difference between tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statement in establishing liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumption may be made in determining whether and the extent to which tax position should be sustained tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on it technical merit the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement new information becomes available we evaluate our tax position and adjust our unrecognized tax benefit appropriate tax benefit ultimately realized can differ from amount previously recognized due to uncertainty with any such difference generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse since deferred tax measure the future tax effect of item recognized in the consolidated financial statement certain estimate and assumption are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary difference and available tax planning strategy these assessment are performed quarterly taking into account any new information change in fact or circumstance can lead to change in the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset due to uncertainty table of content other matter recently issued accounting standard refer to the recently

derivative and hedging activity the company us derivative financial instrument derivative to manage exposure to various market risk these instrument derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variable including interest rate foreign exchange rate and equity index or price and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet these instrument enable end user to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risk and for that reason are an integral component of the company market risk management the company doe not transact in derivative for trading purpose market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability value resulting from movement in market price the company market risk exposure include interest rate risk due to change in the relationship between interest rate on the company asset such loan receivables and investment security and interest rate on the company liability such debt and deposit and foreign exchange risk related to earnings funding transaction and investment in currency other than the dollar the company centrally monitor market risk using market risk limit and escalation trigger defined in it asset liability management policy the company market exposure are in large part byproduct of the delivery of it product and service interest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of card member receivables and fixed rate loan with variable rate borrowing well through the risk to net interest margin from change in the relationship between benchmark rate such prime libor and the overnight indexed swap rate interest rate exposure within the company charge card and fixed rate lending product is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short term and variable rate debt and deposit compared to fixed rate debt and deposit in addition interest rate swap are used from time to time to economically convert fixed rate debt obligation to variable rate obligation or to convert variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate obligation the company may change the mix between variable rate and fixed rate funding based on change in business volume and mix among other factor foreign exchange risk is generated by card member cross currency charge foreign currency balance sheet exposure foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in entity outside the united state the company foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreement to buy and sell currency on spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economically justified through various mean including the use of derivative such foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contract derivative may give rise to counterparty credit risk which is the risk that derivative counterparty will default on or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to an uncollateralized derivative exposure the company manages this risk by considering the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contract on the measurement date well estimating the maximum potential value of the contract over the next month considering such factor the volatility of the underlying or reference index to mitigate derivative credit risk counterparties are required to be pre approved by the company and rated investment grade and counterparty risk exposure are centrally monitored additionally in order to mitigate the bilateral counterparty credit risk associated with derivative the company ha in certain instance entered into master netting agreement with it derivative counterparties which provide right of offset for certain exposure between the party majority of the company derivative asset and liability of december and are subject to such master netting agreement with it derivative counterparties and there are no instance in which management make an accounting policy election to not net asset and liability subject to an enforceable master netting agreement on the company consolidated balance sheet to further mitigate bilateral counterparty credit risk the company exercise it right under executed credit support agreement with certain of it derivative counterparties these agreement require that in the event the fair value change in the net derivative position between the two party exceeds certain dollar threshold the party in the net liability position post collateral to it counterparty all derivative contract cleared through central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contract in relation to the company credit risk under the term of the derivative agreement it ha with it various counterparties the company is not required to either immediately settle any outstanding liability balance or post collateral upon the occurrence of specified credit risk related event the company ha no individually significant derivative counterparties and therefore no significant risk exposure to any single derivative counterparty based on it assessment of the credit risk of the company derivative counterparties of december and no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio wa required the company derivative are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet the accounting for change in fair value depends on the instrument intended use and the resulting hedge designation if any discussed below refer to note for description of

interest rate contract that are not subject to the ccp rule change and amount related to such contract are shown gross of any collateral exchanged includes foreign currency derivative embedded in certain operating agreement represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contract and certain foreign exchange contract with the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral the company held no non cash collateral of december of december the company received non cash collateral from counterparty in the form of security interest in treasury security with fair value of million none of which wa sold or repledged such non cash collateral economically reduced the company risk exposure to million of december but did not reduce the net exposure on the company consolidated balance sheet additionally the company posted million and million of december and respectively initial margin on it centrally cleared interest rate swap such amount are recorded within other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet and are not netted against the derivative balance represents the amount of netting of derivative asset and derivative liability executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement derivative financial instrument that qualify for hedge accounting derivative executed for hedge accounting purpose are documented and designated such when the company enters into the contract in accordance with it risk management policy the company structure it hedge with term similar to those of the item being hedged the company formally ass at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on quarterly basis whether derivative designated hedge are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flow of the hedged item these assessment usually are made through the application of regression analysis method if it is determined that derivative is not highly effective hedge the company will discontinue the application of hedge accounting fair value hedge fair value hedge involves derivative designated to hedge the company exposure to future change in the fair value of an asset or liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to particular risk interest rate contract the company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with it fixed rate long term debt obligation at the time of issuance certain fixed rate debt obligation are designated in fair value hedging relationship using interest rate swap to economically convert the fixed interest rate to floating interest rate the company ha billion and billion of fixed rate debt obligation designated in fair value hedging relationship of december and respectively to the extent the fair value hedge is effective the gain or loss on the hedging instrument offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk any difference between the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the hedged item is referred to hedge ineffectiveness and is reported component of other expense hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by difference between debt obligation interest rate and the benchmark rate primarily due to credit spread at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap furthermore hedge ineffectiveness may be caused by change in month libor month libor and the overnight indexed swap rate spread between these rate impact the fair value of the interest rate swap without causing an exact offsetting impact to the fair value of the hedged debt for the period presented the company considers all fair value hedge to be highly effective and did not de designate any fair value hedge relationship table
