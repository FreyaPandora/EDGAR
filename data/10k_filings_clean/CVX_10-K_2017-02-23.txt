company and it operating and financial result are subject to variety of risk inherent in the global oil gas and petrochemical business many of these risk are not within the company control and could materially impact the company result of operation and financial condition chevron is exposed to the effect of changing commodity price chevron is primarily in commodity business that ha history of price volatility the single largest variable that affect the company result of operation is the price of crude oil which can be influenced by general economic condition industry inventory level technology advancement production quota or other action that might be imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec weather related damage and disruption competing fuel price and geopolitical risk chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity price part of it business planning process an investment in the company carry significant exposure to fluctuation in global crude oil price extended period of low price for crude oil can have material adverse impact on the company result of operation financial condition and liquidity among other thing the company upstream earnings cash flow and capital and exploratory expenditure program could be negatively affected could it production and proved reserve upstream asset may also become impaired downstream earnings could be negatively affected they depend upon the supply and demand for refined product and the associated margin on refined product sale significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company credit rating potentially increase financing cost and reduce access to debt market the company may be unable to realize anticipated cost saving expenditure reduction and asset sale that are intended to compensate for such downturn in some case liability associated with divested asset may return to the company an acquirer of those asset subsequently declares bankruptcy in addition extended period of low commodity price can have material adverse impact on the result of operation financial condition and liquidity of the company supplier vendor partner and equity affiliate upon which the company own result of operation and financial condition depends the scope of chevron business will decline if the company not successfully develop resource the company is in an extractive business therefore if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produce with good prospect for future production or through acquisition the company business will decline creating and maintaining an inventory of project depends on many factor including obtaining and renewing right to explore develop and produce hydrocarbon drilling success ability to bring long lead time capital intensive project to completion on budget and on schedule and efficient and profitable operation of mature property the company operation could be disrupted by natural or human cause beyond it control chevron operates in both urban area and remote and sometimes inhospitable region the company operation are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human cause beyond it control including physical risk from hurricane severe storm flood and other form of severe weather war accident civil unrest political event fire earthquake system failure cyber threat and terrorist act any of which could result in suspension of operation or harm to people or the natural environment chevron risk management system are designed to ass potential physical and other risk to it operation and asset and to plan for their resiliency while capital investment review and decision incorporate potential range of physical risk such storm severity and frequency sea level rise air and water temperature precipitation fresh water access wind speed and earthquake severity among other factor it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing frequency or severity of such event any of which could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or financial condition cyberattacks targeting chevron process control network or other digital infrastructure could have material adverse impact on the company business and result of operation there are numerous and evolving risk to cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actor including criminal hacker state sponsored intrusion industrial espionage and employee malfeasance although chevron devotes significant resource to prevent unwanted intrusion and to protect it system and data the company ha experienced and will continue to experience cyber incident of varying degree in the conduct of it business cyber threat actor could compromise the company process control network or other critical system and infrastructure resulting in disruption to it business operation injury to people harm to the environment or asset access to it financial reporting system or loss misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information including intellectual property business information and that of it employee customer partner and other third party cyber event could result in significant financial loss legal or regulatory violation reputational harm and legal liability and could ultimately have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation the company operation have inherent risk and hazard that require significant and continuous oversight chevron result depend on it ability to identify and mitigate the risk and hazard inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas the company seek to minimize these operational risk by carefully designing and building it facility and conducting it operation in safe and reliable manner however failure to manage these risk effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incident including release explosion or mechanical failure resulting in personal injury loss of life environmental damage loss of revenue legal liability and or disruption to operation chevron ha implemented and maintains system of corporate policy process and system behavior and compliance mechanism to manage safety health environmental reliability and efficiency risk to verify compliance with applicable law and policy and to respond to and learn from unexpected incident in certain situation where chevron is not the operator the company may have limited influence and control third party which may limit it ability to manage and control such risk chevron business subject the company to liability risk from litigation or government action the company produce transport refines and market material with potential toxicity and it purchase handle and disposes of other potentially toxic material in the course of it business chevron operation also produce byproduct which may be considered pollutant often these operation are conducted through joint venture over which the company may have limited influence and control any of these activity could result in liability or significant delay in operation arising from private litigation or government action either result of an accidental unlawful discharge or result of new conclusion about the effect of the company operation on human health or the environment in addition to the extent that societal pressure or political or other factor are involved it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company causation of or contribution to the asserted damage or to other mitigating factor for information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved including information relating to ecuador matter see note to the consolidated financial statement beginning on page the company doe not insure all potential loss which could result in significant financial exposure the company doe not have commercial insurance or third party indemnity to fully cover all operational risk or potential liability in the event of significant incident or series of incident causing catastrophic loss result the company is to substantial extent self insured for such event the company relies on existing liquidity financial resource and borrowing capacity to meet short term obligation that would arise from such an event or series of event the occurrence of significant incident or unforeseen liability for which the company is not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or financial condition political instability and significant change in the regulatory environment could harm chevron business the company operation particularly exploration and production can be affected by changing economic regulatory and political environment in the various country in which it operates ha occurred in the past action could be taken by government to increase public ownership of the company partially or wholly owned business or to impose additional tax or royalty in certain location government have proposed or imposed restriction on the company operation export and exchange control burdensome tax and public disclosure requirement that might harm the company competitiveness or relation with other government or third party in other country political condition have existed that may threaten the safety of employee and the company continued presence in those country and internal unrest act of violence or strained relation between government and the company or other government may adversely affect the company operation those development have at time significantly affected the company operation and result and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such country in addition change in national state or local environmental regulation or law including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas such those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or ban on drilling could adversely affect the company current or anticipated future operation and profitability regulation of greenhouse gas ghg emission could increase chevron operational cost and reduce demand for chevron hydrocarbon and other product in the year ahead company in the energy industry like chevron may be challenged by an increase in international and domestic regulation relating to ghg emission such regulation could have the impact of curtailing profitability in the oil and gas sector or rendering the extraction of the company oil and gas resource economically infeasible although the iea world energy outlook scenario anticipate global demand for oil to continue increasing until and even ghg constrained scenario such the iea case anticipate significant demand for petroleum and natural gas given their respective advantage in transportation and power generation if new onset of regulation contributes to decline in the demand for the company product this could have material adverse effect on the company and it financial condition international agreement the paris agreement and the kyoto protocol and national carbon tax cap and trade or efficiency standard regional and state legislation california and low carbon fuel standard and regulatory measure the environmental protection agency methane performance standard that aim to limit or reduce ghg are currently in various stage of implementation for example the paris agreement went into effect in november and number of country are adopting policy to meet their paris agreement goal in the united state the company ha been complying with currently implemented program such the federal renewable fuel standard program and related volume standard and state regulation such california including the cap and trade program and related low carbon fuel standard obligation follow on legislation to california known california wa signed into law in with effect in and is currently in the scoping plan phase separately other state and locality have also sought to directly regulate ghg emission through mechanism such for example carbon tax many of the foregoing are still in proposal stage and others face legal challenge or legislative effort to be repealed or significantly reformed thus even with respect to existing regulatory compliance obligation the landscape continues to be in state of constant assessment and legal challenge making it difficult to predict with certainty the ultimate impact that such regulation will have on the company ghg emission related law and related regulation and the effect of operating in potentially carbon constrained environment may result in increased and substantial capital compliance operating and maintenance cost and could among other thing reduce demand for hydrocarbon and the company hydrocarbon based product make the company product more expensive adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company resource and adversely affect the company sale volume revenue and margin ghg emission carbon dioxide and methane that could be regulated include among others those associated with the company exploration and production of hydrocarbon such crude oil and natural gas the upgrading of production from oil sand into synthetic oil power generation the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon product the processing liquefaction and regasification of natural gas the transportation of crude oil natural gas and related product and consumer or customer use of the company hydrocarbon product many of these activity such consumer and customer use of the company product well action taken by the company competitor in response to such law and regulation are beyond the company control in addition increasing attention to climate change risk ha resulted in an increased possibility of governmental investigation and potentially private litigation against the company consideration of ghg issue and the response to those issue through international agreement and national regional or state legislation or regulation are integrated into the company strategy and planning capital investment review and risk management tool and process where applicable they are also factored into the company long range supply demand and energy price forecast these forecast reflect long range effect from renewable fuel penetration energy efficiency standard climate related policy action and demand response to oil and natural gas price additionally the company ass carbon pricing risk by considering carbon cost in these forecast the actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change related law and regulation and amount of additional investment in new or existing technology or facility such carbon dioxide injection is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual law and regulation enacted in jurisdiction the company activity in it and market condition the ultimate effect of international agreement and national regional and state legislation and regulatory measure to limit ghg emission on the company financial performance and the timing of these effect will depend on number of factor such factor include among others the sector covered the greenhouse gas emission reduction required the extent to which chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocation or would need to purchase compliance instrument on the open market or through auction the price and availability of emission allowance and credit and the extent to which the company is able to recover the cost incurred through the pricing of the company product in the competitive marketplace further the ultimate impact of ghg emission related agreement legislation and measure on the company financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty for multitude of individual jurisdiction the outcome of political decision making process and the variable and tradeoff that inevitably occur in connection with such process

angola argentina australia azerbaijan bangladesh brazil canada china colombia democratic republic of the congo denmark indonesia kazakhstan myanmar nigeria the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait the philippine republic of congo singapore south africa south korea thailand trinidad and tobago the united kingdom the united state and venezuela earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of it upstream business segment the biggest factor affecting the result of operation for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil the price of crude oil ha fallen significantly since mid year reflecting persistently high global crude oil inventory and production the downturn in the price of crude oil ha impacted and depending upon it duration will continue to significantly impact the company result of operation cash flow leverage capital and exploratory investment program and production outlook the company is responding with reduction in operating expense including employee reduction pacing and re focusing of capital and exploratory expenditure and increased asset sale the company anticipates that crude oil price will increase in the future continued growth in demand and slowing in supply growth should bring global market into balance however the timing of any such increase is unknown in the company downstream business crude oil is the largest cost component of refined product it is the company objective to deliver competitive result and shareholder value in any business environment the effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during period of significant earnings volatility this is due to the mix effect that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or loss and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdiction result decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected result in future period note provides the company effective income tax rate for the last three year refer to the cautionary statement relevant to forward looking information on page and to risk factor in part item on page through for discussion of some of the inherent risk that could materially impact the company result of operation or financial condition the company continually evaluates opportunity to dispose of asset that are not expected to provide sufficient long term value or to acquire asset or operation complementary to it asset base to help augment the company financial performance and discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsvalue growth refer to the result of operation section beginning on page for discussion of net gain on asset sale during asset disposition and restructurings may also occur in future period and could result in significant gain or loss the company closely monitor development in the financial and credit market the level of worldwide economic activity and the implication for the company of movement in price for crude oil and natural gas management take these development into account in the conduct of daily operation and for business planning comment related to earnings trend for the company major business area are follows upstream earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry price for crude oil and natural gas crude oil and natural gas price are subject to external factor over which the company ha no control including product demand connected with global economic condition industry inventory level technology advancement production quota or other action imposed by the organization of petroleum exporting country opec action of regulator weather related damage and disruption competing fuel price and regional supply interruption or fear thereof that may be caused by military conflict civil unrest or political uncertainty any of these factor could also inhibit the company production capacity in an affected region the company closely monitor development in the country in which it operates and hold investment and seek to manage risk in operating it facility and business the longer term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also function of other factor including the company ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas change in fiscal term of contract and change in tax law and regulation the company continues to actively manage it schedule of work contracting procurement and supply chain activity to effectively manage cost however price level for capital and exploratory cost and operating expense associated with the production of crude oil and natural gas can be subject to external factor beyond the company control including among other thing the general level of inflation commodity price and price charged by the industry material and service provider which can be affected by the volatility of the industry own supply and demand condition for such material and service result of the decline in price of crude oil and other commodity since mid these cost have declined capital and exploratory expenditure and operating expense can also be affected by damage to production facility caused by severe weather or civil unrest delay in construction or other factor the chart above show the trend in benchmark price for brent crude oil west texas intermediate wti crude oil and henry hub natural gas the brent price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in of mid february the brent price wa per barrel the majority of the company equity crude production is priced based on the brent benchmark crude oil price remained low through much of but increased modestly late in the year after opec announced production cut on november opec agreed to cap production at million barrel per day starting in january the wti price averaged per barrel for the full year compared to in of mid february the wti price wa per barrel wti traded at discount to brent for much of due to high inventory and excess crude supply in the market discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsa differential in crude oil price exists between high quality high gravity low sulfur crude and those of lower quality low gravity high sulfur the amount of the differential in any period is associated with the relative supply demand balance for each crude type which are function of the capacity of refinery that are able to process each feedstock into high value light product motor gasoline jet fuel aviation gasoline and diesel fuel in second half the differential held generally steady in north america robust refinery demand supported heavy crude value while light sweet crude price in the were supported by slowing domestic production outside of north america differential were steady to slightly wider amid well supplied light sweet crude market in the atlantic basin while continued robust middle east export and rising iranian production kept pressure on heavier more sour crude differential widened in december light sweet crude value benefited more from the announced opec deal chevron produce or share in the production of heavy crude oil in california indonesia the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait venezuela and in certain field in angola china and the united kingdom sector of the north sea see page for the company average and international crude oil realization in contrast to price movement in the global market for crude oil price change for natural gas in many regional market are more closely aligned with supply and demand condition in those market fluctuation in the price of natural gas in the united state are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volume produced and stored in north america in the united state price at henry hub averaged per thousand cubic foot mcf during compared with during of mid february the henry hub spot price wa per mcf outside the united state price change for natural gas depend on wide range of supply demand and regulatory circumstance chevron sell natural gas into the domestic pipeline market in most location in some location chevron continues to invest in long term project to install infrastructure to produce and liquefy natural gas for transport by tanker to other market the company long term contract price for liquefied natural gas lng are typically linked to crude oil price most of the equity lng offtake from the operated australian lng project is committed under binding long term contract with the remainder to be sold in the asian spot lng market the asian spot market reflects the supply and demand for lng in the pacific basin and is not directly linked to crude oil price international natural gas realization averaged per mcf during compared with per mcf during see page for the company average natural gas realization for the and international region the company worldwide net oil equivalent production in averaged million barrel per day about one sixth of the company net oil equivalent production in occurred in the opec member country of angola nigeria and venezuela opec quota had no effect on the company net crude oil production in or the company estimate that net oil equivalent production in will grow to percent compared to assuming brent crude oil price of per barrel and before the effect of anticipated asset sale the impact of asset sale on full year production is expected to be in the range of to barrel of oil equivalent per day depending on the timing of the close of individual transaction this estimate is subject to many factor and uncertainty including the duration of the low price environment that began in second half quota or other action that may be imposed by opec price effect on entitlement volume change in fiscal term or restriction on the scope of company operation delay in construction start up or ramp up of project fluctuation in demand for natural gas in various market weather condition that may shut in production civil unrest changing geopolitics delay in completion of maintenance turnaround greater than expected decline in production from mature field or other disruption to operation the outlook for future production level is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunity and for new large scale project the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production investment in upstream project generally begin well in advance of the start of the associated crude oil and natural gas production significant majority of chevron upstream investment is made outside the united state discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsin the partitioned zone between saudi arabia and kuwait production wa shut in beginning in may result of difficulty in securing work and equipment permit net oil equivalent production in the partitioned zone in wa barrel per day during net oil equivalent production averaged barrel per day of early

through for additional discussion of the company upstream business downstream earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margin on the refining manufacturing and marketing of product that include gasoline diesel jet fuel lubricant fuel oil fuel and lubricant additive and petrochemical industry margin are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply and demand balance for refined product and petrochemical and by change in the price of crude oil other refinery and petrochemical feedstock and natural gas industry margin can also be influenced by inventory level geopolitical event cost of material and service refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization maintenance program and disruption at refinery or chemical plant resulting from unplanned outage due to severe weather fire or other operational event other factor affecting profitability for downstream operation include the reliability and efficiency of the company refining marketing and petrochemical asset the effectiveness of it crude oil and product supply function and the volatility of tanker charter rate for the company shipping operation which are driven by the industry demand for crude oil and product tanker other factor beyond the company control include the general level of inflation and energy cost to operate the company refining marketing and

accepted accounting principle gaap that may have material impact on the company consolidated financial statement and related disclosure and on the comparability of such information over different reporting period such estimate and assumption affect reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well disclosure of contingent asset and liability estimate and assumption are based on management experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statement materially different result can occur circumstance change and additional information becomes known discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsthe discussion in this section of critical accounting estimate and assumption is according to the disclosure guideline of the security and exchange commission sec wherein the nature of the estimate and assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change the impact of the estimate and assumption on the company financial condition or operating performance is material the development and selection of accounting estimate and assumption including those deemed critical and the associated disclosure in this discussion have been discussed by management with the audit committee of the board of director the area of accounting and the associated critical estimate and assumption made by the company are follows oil and gas reserve crude oil and natural gas reserve are estimate of future production that impact certain asset and expense account included in the consolidated financial statement proved reserve are the estimated quantity of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic condition operating method and government regulation proved reserve include both developed and undeveloped volume proved developed reserve represent volume expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve are volume expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled proved acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion variable impacting chevron estimated volume of crude oil and natural gas reserve include field performance available technology commodity price and development and production cost the estimate of crude oil and natural gas reserve are important to the timing of expense recognition for cost incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing asset impact of oil and gas reserve on chevron consolidated financial statement using the successful effort method of accounting include the following amortization capitalized exploratory drilling and development cost are depreciated on unit of production uop basis using proved developed reserve acquisition cost of proved property are amortized on uop basis using total proved reserve during chevron uop depreciation depletion and amortization dd for oil and gas property wa billion and proved developed reserve at the beginning of were billion barrel for consolidated company if the estimate of proved reserve used in the uop calculation for consolidated operation had been lower by percent across all oil and gas property uop dd in would have increased by approximately million impairment oil and gas reserve are used in assessing oil and gas producing property for impairment significant reduction in the estimated reserve of property would trigger an impairment review proved reserve and in some case portion of unproved resource are used to estimate future production volume in the cash flow model for further discussion of estimate and assumption used in impairment assessment see impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate below refer to table reserve quantity information beginning on page for the change in proved reserve estimate for the three year ending december and to table vii change in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flow from proved reserve on page for estimate of proved reserve value for each of the three year ended december this oil and gas reserve commentary should be read in conjunction with the property plant and equipment section of note beginning on page which includes description of the successful effort method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activity impairment of property plant and equipment and investment in affiliate the company ass it property plant and equipment pp for possible impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable if the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flow expected from the asset an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value of the asset over it estimated fair value determination to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimate on highly uncertain matter such future commodity price the effect of inflation and technology improvement on operating expense production profile and the outlook for global or regional market supply and demand condition for crude oil natural gas commodity chemical and refined product however the impairment review and calculation are based on assumption that are generally consistent with the company business plan and long term investment decision refer also to the discussion of impairment of property plant and equipment in note on page and to the section on property plant and equipment in note summary of significant accounting policy beginning on page discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsthe company routinely performs impairment review when triggering event arise to determine whether any write down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required for example when significant downward revision to crude oil and natural gas reserve are made for any single field or concession an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable similarly significant downward revision in the company crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment review for impacted upstream asset in addition impairment could occur due to change in national state or local environmental regulation or law including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas also if the expectation of sale of particular asset or asset group in any period ha been deemed more likely than not an impairment review is performed and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group no impairment charge is required such calculation are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed of asset that are not impaired on held and used basis could possibly become impaired if decision is made to sell such asset that is the asset would be impaired if they are classified held for sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale le cost to sell are le than the asset associated carrying value investment in common stock of affiliate that are accounted for under the equity method well investment in other security of these equity investees are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment fall below the company carrying value when this occurs determination must be made to whether this loss is other than temporary in which case the investment is impaired because of the number of differing assumption potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment sensitivity analysis is not practicable the company reported impairment for certain oil and gas property during due to reservoir performance and lower crude oil price the company reported impairment for certain oil and gas property during primarily result of downward revision in the company longer term crude oil price outlook the impairment for the year and were primarily in brazil and the united state no material individual impairment of pp or investment were recorded for the year sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these period if other assumption had been used in impairment review and impairment calculation is not practicable given the broad range of the company pp and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to some assumption might have avoided the need to impair any asset in these period whereas unfavorable change might have caused an additional unknown number of other asset to become impaired or resulted in larger impact on impaired asset asset retirement obligation in the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation aro the company us various assumption and judgment including such factor the existence of legal obligation estimated amount and timing of settlement discount and inflation rate and the expected impact of advance in technology and process improvement sensitivity analysis of the aro impact on earnings for is not practicable given the broad range of the company long lived asset and the number of assumption involved in the estimate that is favorable change to some assumption would have reduced estimated future obligation thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization cost whereas unfavorable change would have the opposite effect

during each year discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationstotal pension expense for wa billion an increase in the expected long term return on plan asset or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense and vice versa an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long term rate of return assumption percent increase in this assumption for the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of companywide pension expense would have reduced total pension plan expense for by approximately million percent increase in the discount rate for this plan would have reduced pension expense for by approximately million the aggregate funded status recognized at december wa net liability of approximately billion an increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation thus changing the funded status of plan at december the company used discount rate of percent to measure the obligation for the pension plan an indication of the sensitivity of pension liability to the discount rate assumption percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company primary pension plan which accounted for about percent of the companywide pension obligation would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately million and would have decreased the plan underfunded status from approximately billion to billion for the company opeb plan expense for wa million and the total liability all unfunded at the end of wa billion for the main opeb plan the company used discount rate for service cost of percent and discount rate for interest cost of percent to measure expense in and percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligation at december discount rate change similar to those used in the pension sensitivity

asset class return an assessment of expected future performance advice from external actuarial firm and the incorporation of specific asset class risk factor asset allocation are periodically updated using pension plan asset liability study and the company estimated long term rate of return are consistent with these study for the company used an expected long term rate of return of percent for pension plan asset which account for percent of the company pension plan asset in both and the company used long term rate of return of percent for this plan the market related value of asset of the main pension plan used in the determination of pension expense wa based on the market value in the three month preceding the year end measurement date management considers the three month time period long enough to minimize the effect of distortion from day to day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year for other plan market value of asset of year end is used in calculating the pension expense discount rate the discount rate assumption used to determine the and international pension and opeb plan obligation and expense reflect the rate at which benefit could be effectively settled and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis this analysis considered the projected benefit payment specific to the company plan and the yield on high quality bond beginning with the december measurement date the projected cash flow were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main pension and opeb plan the effective discount rate derived from this analysis at the end of were percent for the main pension plan and percent for the main opeb plan the discount rate for these plan at the end of were and percent respectively while in they were and percent for these plan respectively beginning with the fiscal year ended december the company changed the method used to estimate the service and interest cost associated with the company main pension and opeb plan under the new method these cost are estimated by applying spot rate along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flow in prior year the service and interest cost were estimated utilizing single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the year other

physical limitation of infrastructure or plant capacity that dictate project timing compression project that are pending reservoir pressure decline and contractual limitation that dictate production level at year end the company held approximately billion boe of proved undeveloped reserve that have remained undeveloped for five year or more the majority of these reserve are in three location where the company ha proven track record of developing major project in australia approximately million boe have remained undeveloped for five year or more related to the gorgon and wheatstone project the company is currently constructing liquefaction and other facility in australia to develop this natural gas in africa approximately million boe have remained undeveloped for five year or more primarily due to facility constraint at various field and infrastructure associated with the escravos gas project in nigeria affiliate account for about billion boe of proved undeveloped reserve with
