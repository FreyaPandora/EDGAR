introduction of other service that we believe could enhance the travel experience of our customer of contentsmarketing and brand awareness booking com priceline com and agoda have established widely used and recognized commerce brand through aggressive marketing and promotion campaign in late we re branded our international rental car business rentalcars com and intend to market that brand worldwide through online advertising during our total online advertising expense were approximately million substantial portion of which wa spent internationally through internet search engine and online affiliate marketing we also invested approximately million in priceline com branded offline advertising in the united state we intend to continue marketing strategy to aggressively promote brand awareness primarily through online mean our international operation have become more meaningful contributor to our result we have seen and expect to continue to see change in our advertising expense specifically online advertising percentage of gross profit increased for the year ended december compared to the same period in the increase is driven primarily by brand mix rather than change in the fundamental efficiency of our advertising by brand our international operation are growing faster than our priceline com business in the and spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising trend which we expect to continue furthermore the priceline com brand in the is obtaining an increasing share of it traffic through online advertising trend which we also expect to continue we recognize advertising expense incurred at the time of booking but recognize the gross profit for price disclosed hotel room and rental car reservation when the travel is completed competition we compete with both online and traditional seller of the service we offer the market for the service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new site at relatively low cost we may not be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerate such google microsoft or expedia each of which may have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do we currently or potentially compete with variety of company with respect to each service we offer with respect to our travel service these competitor include but are not limited to internet travel service such expedia hotel com hotwire elong carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity lastminute com holiday auto and zuji which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel and gulliver octopustravel superbreak hotel de hotel reservation service autoeurope car trawler ctrip makemytrip rakuten jalan and wotif travel supplier such hotel company airline and rental car company many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including without limitation room key recently launched hotel search engine owned by several major hotel company large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel bing including bing travel facebook groupon and living social traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator online travel search site such kayak com trivago com mobissimo com farechase com and hotelscombined each sometimes referred to meta search site and travel research site that have search functionality such tripadvisor travelzoo and cheapflights com and operator of travel industry reservation database such galileo travelport amadeus and sabre large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the and internationally for example following it acquisition of ita software inc major flight information software company google recently launched new flight search tool that enables user to find fare schedule and availability directly on google and excludes online travel agent ota participation within the search result google ha also invested in homeaway publicly traded vacation home rental service and launched hotel finder utility that allows user to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the user in addition microsoft ha launched bing travel which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search site leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the searcher specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other website of contentsand in many instance compete directly with for customer furthermore certain supplier limit ota participation within the meta search result some meta search site such kayak com which offer it user the ability to make hotel reservation directly on it website may evolve into more traditional online travel site these initiative among others illustrate clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumer by showing consumer more detailed travel search result including specific information for traveler own itinerary which could lead to supplier or others gaining larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine maintaining transaction within their own website if google the single largest search engine in the world or bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future it could result in among other thing more competition from supplier website and higher customer acquisition cost for third party site such and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition several major hotel company including choice hotel international hilton worldwide hyatt intercontinental hotel group wyndham hotel group and marriott have launched room key hotel search engine that competes directly with our hotel room night reservation service the hotel company that own room key have stated goal of driving demand directly to their brand website thus reducing the share received by online travel agency they may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rate better room availability or additional feature or amenity through room key than are available through service like ours if room key is successful our share of the online hotel room night reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer hotel are also increasingly offering hotel room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount expedia recently entered into partnership with groupon to sell hotel room reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name if these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque hotel service to consumer an area in which priceline com ha been leader ha become more intense over the recent past for example in the fourth quarter of expedia began making opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha been supporting the initiative with national television advertising campaign in addition in travelocity launched an opaque price disclosed hotel booking service that allows customer to book room at discount with our name your own price hotel booking service for these service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase we believe these new offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate for our opaque hotel service which experienced modest decline in room night reservation in compared to in addition hotel are increasingly offering discounted hotel room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social if expedia or travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service and or daily deal website are successful in garnering sizable share of discounted hotel booking we may have le consumer demand for our opaque hotel service over time and we are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate result we believe our share of the discount hotel market in the could further decrease we believe that for number of reason including the recent significant year over year increase in retail airfare consumer are engaging in increased shopping behavior before making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel the launch of room key discussed above is demonstrative of the effort of many hotel airline and rental car supplier including supplier with which we conduct business to drive online demand to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such certain supplier have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website furthermore some airline may distribute their ticket exclusively through their own website supplier who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours see risk factor intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance of contentsoperations and technology our business is supported by multiple system platform which were designed with an emphasis on scalability performance and reliability the platform are largely independent among booking com priceline com agoda and rentalcars com the software platform and architecture use variety of tool within each corporate implementation including server side java asp net and perl and sql script integrated with oracle mysql and microsoft sql server relational database system these internal platform were designed to include open application protocol interface that can provide connectivity to vendor in the industry in which we operate these include large global system such airline and hotel room reservation system and financial service provider well individual supplier such individual hotel our internet server utilize digital certificate to help conduct secure communication and transaction appropriate the system infrastructure and web and database server of our international operation are primarily hosted in england the netherlands and hong kong each location ha backup generator and infrastructure typical of hosted data center our system infrastructure and web and database server in the are hosted at two data center location each of which provides network connectivity networking infrastructure and hour monitoring and engineering support our network operation center is located in our norwalk connecticut headquarters and monitor all web hosting facility all data center facility have continuous power supply system generator redundant server and multiple back system if one hosting facility were inaccessible for any reason we would need to shift all traffic to another hosting facility customer service for our international business is provided primarily through in house customer call center we outsource most of our based priceline com call center and customer service function and use real time interactive voice response system with transfer capability to our call center and customer service center intellectual property over time and through acquisition we have assembled portfolio of patent trademark service mark copyright domain name and trade secret covering the priceline group service we regard the protection of our intellectual property critical to our success we protect our intellectual property right by relying on federal state and common law right in the and internationally well variety of administrative procedure we also rely on contractual restriction to protect our proprietary right in our service we have entered into confidentiality and invention assignment agreement with our employee and contractor and nondisclosure agreement with party with we conduct business in order to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information we pursue the registration of our domain name trademark and service mark in the and internationally we currently hold numerous issued united state patent and pending united state and international patent application we file additional patent application on new invention appropriate effective trademark copyright patent domain name trade dress and trade secret protection is expensive to maintain and may require litigation the priceline group expands internationally we must protect our intellectual property right and other proprietary right in an increasing number of jurisdiction process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful in every location see risk factor we face risk related to our intellectual property governmental regulation the service we provide are subject to various federal state international and local regulation for example our travel service is subject to law governing the offer and or sale of travel service well law requiring to register seller of travel in certain jurisdiction in addition our service may be subject to various federal state international and local taxing regulation see risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation and we may have exposure to additional tax liability we are subject to federal state and international law that require protection of user privacy and user data in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data in the united state europe and asia this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union such government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction of contentsin addition our strategy involves rapid expansion into region around the world including asia south america and elsewhere many of which have different legislation regulatory environment and tax law compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement will place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence which may have an adverse effect on our business seasonalitya meaningful amount of retail gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which booking are generated result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for the year for our north american and european business however we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result in addition our name your own price service are generally non refundable in nature and accordingly we recognize travel revenue at the time booking is generated however we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service including booking com and agoda at the time that the customer check out of the hotel therefore if our retail hotel business continues to grow we expect our quarterly result to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factor employee of january we employed approximately full time employee of which approximately are based in the united state and approximately are based in our international office we also retain independent contractor to support our customer service website content translation and system support function we have never had work stoppage and our employee are not represented by any collective bargaining unit we consider our relation with our employee to be good our future success will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract integrate retain and motivate highly qualified technical and managerial personnel for whom competition is intense see risk factor we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed the priceline group website we maintain website with the address www booking com www priceline com www agoda com and www rentalcars com among others we are not including

and uncertainty described are not the only one we face additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to may also impair our business operation if any of the following risk occur our business financial condition operating result and cash flow could be materially adversely affected we are dependent on the travel industry our financial prospect are significantly dependent upon our sale of travel service particularly leisure travel travel including hotel rental car and airline ticket reservation is dependent on discretionary spending level result sale of travel service tend to decline during general economic downturn and recession accordingly the recent worldwide recession led to weakening in the fundamental demand for our service and an increase in the number of customer who canceled existing travel reservation with recently we have experienced volatility in growth rate for transaction booked and in cancellation for our international business we have also observed decline in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs for certain southern european country likely due to the impact of weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern this volatility make it more difficult to predict longer term trend and the future impact of macro economic weakness on our business concern over sovereign debt of certain european union country ha caused significant devaluation of the euro relative to other currency such the dollar sovereign debt issue in the european union could lead to further significant and potentially longer term devaluation of the euro the dollar which would adversely impact our euro denominated net asset gross booking revenue operating expense and net income expressed in dollar in addition many government around the world including the government are operating at large financial deficit disruption in the economy of such government could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition furthermore governmental austerity measure aimed at reducing deficit could impair the economic recovery and adversely affect travel demand in addition unforeseen event beyond our control such worldwide recession higher oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority travel related accident or the withdrawal from our system of major hotel supplier or airline could adversely affect our business and result of operation for example in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency japan is an important source of travel demand for agoda and these crisis have had an adverse impact on travel demand originating in japan and demand for japanese destination in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in addition in early thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda thailand based operation future natural disaster or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation we face risk related to the growth rate and expansion of booking com agoda and rentalcars com we derive substantial portion of our revenue from and have significant operation outside of the united state our international operation include the netherlands based hotel reservation service booking com the asia based hotel reservation service agoda and the based rental car reservation service rentalcars com formerly known traveljigsaw each year since our international operation achieved significant year over year growth in their gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and hotel room night and rental car reservation this growth rate ha contributed significantly to our growth in consolidated revenue gross profit and earnings per share over time booking com agoda and rentalcars com will experience decline in their growth rate the absolute level of their gross booking and unit sale grow larger other factor may also slow the growth rate of our international operation including for example worldwide economic condition any strengthening of the dollar versus the euro and other currency decline in adrs increase in cancellation travel market condition and the competitiveness of the market decline in the growth rate of our international operation could have negative impact on our future revenue and earnings per share growth rate and consequence our stock price of contentsthe strategy of booking com agoda and rentalcars com involves rapid expansion into region around the world including europe asia pacific north america south america and elsewhere many of which have different custom different currency different level of customer acceptance of the internet and different legislation regulatory environment tax law and level of political stability in addition compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement will place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence if booking com agoda and rentalcars com are unsuccessful in rapidly expanding into new market our business result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected the number of our employee worldwide ha grown from le than in the first quarter of to approximately of december which growth is mostly comprised of hire by or for our international operation result of such rapid expansion the average tenure of our employee ha become shorter in addition expansion increase the complexity of our business and place additional strain on our management operation technical performance financial resource and internal financial control and reporting function can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our expansion effectively our current and planned personnel system procedure and control may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future operation especially we employ personnel in multiple geographic location we may not be able to hire train retain motivate and manage required personnel which may limit our growth damage our reputation negatively affect our financial performance and harm our business we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate result of the growth of booking com and agoda and the acquisition of the rentalcars com business we are conducting significant portion of our business outside the united state and are reporting our result in dollar result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation for example strengthening of the euro increase our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar while weakening of the euro decrease our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operation booking com agoda and rentalcars com are subject to risk typical of international business including but not limited to differing economic condition change in political climate differing tax structure other regulation and restriction and foreign exchange rate volatility greece ireland portugal and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the dollar and other currency over the past several year intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance we compete with both online and traditional seller of the service we offer the market for the service we offer is intensely competitive and current and new competitor can launch new site at relatively low cost we may not be able to effectively compete with industry conglomerate such google microsoft or expedia each of which may have access to significantly greater and more diversified resource than we do we currently or potentially compete with variety of company with respect to each service we offer with respect to our travel service these competitor include but are not limited to internet travel service such expedia hotel com hotwire elong carrentals com and venere which are owned by expedia travelocity lastminute com holiday auto and zuji which are owned by the sabre group orbitz com cheaptickets ebookers hotelclub and ratestogo which are owned by orbitz worldwide laterooms and asiarooms which are owned by tui travel and gulliver octopustravel superbreak hotel de hotel reservation service autoeurope car trawler ctrip makemytrip rakuten jalan and wotif travel supplier such hotel company airline and rental car company many of which have their own branded website to which they drive business including without limitation room key recently launched hotel search engine owned by several major hotel company of content large online portal social networking group buying and search company such google yahoo including yahoo travel bing including bing travel facebook groupon and living social traditional travel agency wholesaler and tour operator online travel search site such kayak com trivago com mobissimo com farechase com and hotelscombined each sometimes referred to meta search site and travel research site that have search functionality such tripadvisor travelzoo and cheapflights com and operator of travel industry reservation database such galileo travelport amadeus and sabre large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the and internationally for example following it acquisition of ita software inc major flight information software company google recently launched new flight search tool that enables user to find fare schedule and availability directly on google and excludes online travel agent ota participation within the search result google ha also invested in homeaway publicly traded vacation home rental service and launched hotel finder utility that allows user to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the user in addition microsoft ha launched bing travel which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search site leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the searcher specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer furthermore certain supplier limit ota participation within the meta search result some meta search site such kayak com which offer it user the ability to make hotel reservation directly on it website may evolve into more traditional online travel site these initiative among others illustrate clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumer by showing consumer more detailed travel search result including specific information for traveler own itinerary which could lead to supplier or others gaining larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine maintaining transaction within their own website if google the single largest search engine in the world or bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future it could result in among other thing more competition from supplier website and higher customer acquisition cost for third party site such ours and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition several major hotel company including choice hotel international hilton worldwide hyatt intercontinental hotel group wyndham hotel group and marriott have launched room key hotel search engine that competes directly with our hotel room night reservation service the hotel company that own room key have stated goal of driving demand directly to their brand web site thus reducing the share received by online travel agency they may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rate better room availability or additional feature or amenity through room key than are available through service like ours if room key is successful our share of the online hotel room night reservation market could be negatively affected and our business could suffer hotel are also increasingly offering hotel room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount expedia recently entered into partnership with groupon to sell hotel room reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name if these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque hotel service to consumer an area in which priceline com ha been leader ha become more intense over the recent past for example in the fourth quarter of expedia began making opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha been supporting the initiative with national television advertising campaign in addition in travelocity launched an opaque price disclosed hotel booking service that allows customer to book room at discount with our name your own price hotel booking service for these service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase we believe these new offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate for our opaque hotel service which experienced modest decline in room night reservation in compared to in addition hotel are increasingly offering discounted hotel room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social if expedia or travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service and or daily deal website are successful in garnering sizable share of discounted hotel booking we may have le consumer demand for our opaque hotel service over time and we are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate result we believe our share of the of contentsdiscount hotel market in the could further decrease we believe that for number of reason including the recent significant year over year increase in retail airfare consumer are engaging in increased shopping behavior before making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel the launch of room key discussed above is demonstrative of the effort of many hotel airline and rental car supplier including supplier with which we conduct business to drive online demand to their own website in lieu of third party distributor such certain supplier have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website furthermore some airline may distribute their ticket exclusively through their own website supplier who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours we rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire retain and motivate qualified personnel our business would be harmed our performance is largely dependent on the talent and effort of highly skilled individual our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify hire develop motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization in particular the contribution of certain key senior management in the europe and asia are critical to the overall management of the company we can not ensure that we will be able to retain the service of any member of our senior management or other key employee the loss of whom could harm our business in addition competition for well qualified employee in all aspect of our business including software engineer mobile communication talent and other technology professional is intense both in the and abroad with the recent success of our international business and the increased profile of the booking com business and brand competitor have increased their effort to hire our international employee our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employee and to retain and motivate existing employee if we do not succeed in attracting well qualified employee or retaining and motivating existing employee our business would be adversely affected we do not maintain any key person life insurance policy we are dependent on certain supplier our arrangement with the hotel airline and rental car supplier generally do not require them to provide any specific quantity of hotel room reservation airline ticket or rental car or to make room reservation ticket or car available for any particular route in any geographic area or at any particular price during the course of our business we are in continuous dialogue with our major supplier about the nature and extent of their participation in our system the significant reduction on the part of any of our major supplier of their participation in our system for sustained period of time or their complete withdrawal could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition during the recent worldwide recession the hotel industry experienced significant decrease in occupancy rate and adrs and an increase in reservation cancellation rate while lower occupancy rate have historically resulted in hotel supplier increasing their distribution of hotel room reservation through third party intermediary such our remuneration for hotel transaction change proportionately with room price and therefore lower adrs generally have negative effect on our hotel business and negative effect on our gross profit in addition certain hotel have begun initiative to reduce margin received by third party intermediary on retail merchant transaction which is the primary method we employ to distribute retail hotel room reservation in the united state many hotel distribute room reservation through their own website and therefore might increase negotiated rate for merchant rate hotel room reservation sold through our merchant price disclosed hotel service decreasing the margin available to while our merchant price disclosed hotel agreement with our leading hotel supplier provide for specified discount if one or more participating hotel were to require to limit our merchant margin upon contract renewal or otherwise it could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we could be adversely affected by change in the airline industry and in many case we will have no control over such change or their timing example of such change could include without limitation carrier bankruptcy industry consolidation capacity reduction airfare increase and loss of gd incentive any or all of which could adversely affect our of contentsbusiness additionally some rental car supplier have begun offering discounted prepaid reservation on their own site and through certain online travel agent if such rate are sufficiently discounted or are associated with more flexible cancellation policy than those applicable to our name your own price rental car service which are generally non cancellable the value proposition of our name your own price rental car service would be negatively impacted which could reduce demand for that service and could adversely affect our business online advertising is our largest expense and is subject to variability our international operation have become more meaningful contributor to our result we have seen and expect to continue to see online advertising which is our largest expense increase percentage of gross profit our international operation are growing faster than our priceline com business in the and spend higher percentage of gross profit on online advertising trend which we expect to continue furthermore the priceline com brand is obtaining an increasing share of it traffic through online advertising trend which we also expect to continue in addition advertising efficiency is impacted by number of factor including without limitation adrs cost per click cancellation rate foreign exchange rate and the extent to which we are successful in converting paid traffic to booking customer and then causing customer to return directly to our website for future booking adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation number of jurisdiction in the united state have initiated lawsuit against on line travel company including related to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax in addition number of municipality have initiated audit proceeding issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax see note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax either retroactively or prospectively or both in connection with some hotel occupancy tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the ordinance in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe that we are subject to such tax and even if such payment are made we intend to continue to assert our position vigorously litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other online travel company that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay to play payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our earnings or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have one with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either step could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date municipality seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost the october jury verdict in the san antonio litigation and the related proceeding to determine among other thing the amount of penalty interest and attorney fee that could be owed by illustrate that any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained by our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit of contentswe will continue to ass the risk of the potential financial impact of additional tax exposure and to the extent appropriate we will reserve for those estimate of liability fluctuation in our financial result make quarterly comparison and financial forecasting difficult our revenue and operating result have varied significantly from quarter to quarter because our business experience seasonal fluctuation which reflect seasonal trend for the travel service offered by our website traditional leisure travel booking in europe and the united state are higher in the second and third calendar quarter of the year consumer take spring and summer vacation in the first and fourth quarter of the calendar year demand for travel service in europe and the united state generally decline from seasonal perspective meaningful amount of retail gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in the northern hemisphere however we will not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which booking are generated result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for the year for our north american and european business however we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result our revenue and operating result may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter because of these factor result quarter to quarter comparison of our revenue and operating result may not be meaningful for example over the last several year we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night booked through our hotel reservation service however given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business we believe it is highly likely that our year over year room night reservation growth rate will generally decelerate on quarterly sequential basis in future period because of these fluctuation and uncertainty our operating result may fail to meet the expectation of security analyst and investor if this happens the trading price of our common stock would be adversely affected our processing storage use and disclosure of personal data expose to risk of internal or external security breach and could give rise to liability result of governmental regulation conflicting legal requirement or differing view of personal privacy right the security of data when engaging in electronic commerce is essential to maintaining consumer and supplier confidence in our service substantial or ongoing security breach whether instigated internally or externally on our system or other internet based system could significantly harm our business we currently require customer who use certain of our service to guarantee their offer with their credit card either online or in some instance through our toll free telephone service it is possible that advance in computer circumvention capability new discovery or other development including our own act or omission could result in compromise or breach of customer transaction data we can not guarantee that our existing security measure will prevent security breach or attack party whether internal external an affiliate or unrelated third party that is able to circumvent our security system could steal customer information or transaction data proprietary information or cause significant interruption in our operation for instance from time to time we have experienced denial of service type attack on our system that have made portion of our website slow or unavailable for period of time in addition several major corporation experienced well publicized online security breach during the first half of including among others sony the data security firm rsa lockheed martin the email wholesaler epsilon the fox broadcast network and citigroup we may need to expend significant resource to protect against security breach or to address problem caused and liability incurred by breach and reduction in website availability and response time could cause loss of substantial business volume during the occurrence of any such incident these issue are likely to become more difficult we expand the number of place where we operate and the tool and technique used in such attack become more advanced security breach could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction security breach could also cause customer and potential customer to lose confidence in our security which would have negative effect on the value of our brand our insurance policy carry low coverage limit and would likely not be adequate to reimburse for loss caused by security breach we also face risk associated with security breach affecting third party conducting business over the internet consumer generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problem could inhibit the growth of the internet and therefore our service mean of conducting commercial transaction additionally of contentssecurity breach at third party such supplier or distributor system upon which we rely could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction some of our business is conducted with third party marketing affiliate which may generate travel reservation through our infrastructure or through other system security breach at such third party could be perceived by consumer security breach of our system and could result in negative publicity damage our reputation expose to risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and subject to regulatory penalty and sanction in addition such third party may not comply with applicable disclosure requirement which could expose to liability in our processing of travel transaction we receive and store large volume of personally identifiable data this data is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation in numerous jurisdiction around the world including the commission of the european union through it data protection directive and variation of that directive in the member state of the european union this government action is typically intended to protect the privacy of personal data that is collected processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction we could be adversely affected if legislation or regulation are expanded to require change in our business practice or if governing jurisdiction interpret or implement their legislation or regulation in way that negatively affect our business result of operation and financial condition in addition in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of september in the united state government agency have been contemplating or developing initiative to enhance national and aviation security such the transportation security administration computer assisted passenger prescreening system known capps ii these initiative may result in conflicting legal requirement with respect to data handling privacy and data protection ha become more sensitive issue we may also become exposed to potential liability result of differing view on the privacy of travel data travel business have also been subjected to investigation lawsuit and adverse publicity due to allegedly improper disclosure of passenger information these and other privacy development that are difficult to anticipate could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition proposed cookie law could negatively impact the way we do business in june

detail user doe not have to re enter them when revisiting site and enhance the user experience on website cooky are valuable tool for website like booking com and priceline com to improve customer experience and increase conversion on their website this bill would require website such booking com to provide dutch user with clear and comprehensive information about the storage and use of certain cooky and obtain prior consent from the user before placing certain cooky on user web browser consent could be accomplished by asking user to check box to consent to the use of the cooky before proceeding on the website opt in consent the bill must be adopted by the dutch senate before it will become law the dutch senate is currently debating the bill the bill is intended to implement certain provision of the european union eprivacy directive which requires member country to adopt regulation governing the use of cooky by website servicing customer from the european union if the dutch bill is adopted by the senate in it current form or if european union country adopt similarly restrictive cookie regulation that require opt in consent before certain cooky can be placed on user web browser it might adversely affect our ability in particular booking com ability to service certain customer in the manner we currently do and impair our ability to continue to improve and optimize performance on our website result these regulation if adopted could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our stock price is highly volatile the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and is likely to continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to factor such the following some of which are beyond our control operating result that vary from the expectation of security analyst and investor quarterly variation in our operating result change in expectation to our future financial performance including financial

lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically announcement by third party of significant claim or proceeding against or adverse development in pending proceeding occurrence of significant security breach addition or departure of key personnel and stock market price and volume fluctuation sale of substantial number of share of our common stock could adversely affect the market price of our common stock by introducing large number of seller to the market given the volatility that exists for our share such sale could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly in addition fluctuation in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum hedge or day trading investor who often shift fund into and out of stock rapidly exacerbating price fluctuation in either direction particularly when viewed on quarterly basis the trading price of internet company stock in general including ours have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation to the extent that the public perception of the prospect of internet or commerce company is negative our stock price could decline regardless of our result other broad market and industry factor may decrease the market price of our common stock regardless of our operating performance market fluctuation well general political and economic condition such recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuation also may decrease the market price of our common stock negative market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise additional

operation of contentsour business could be negatively affected by change in search engine algorithm and dynamic or termination of traffic generating arrangement we utilize internet search engine and other travel demand aggregation website principally through the purchase of travel related keywords to generate traffic to our website booking com agoda and rentalcars com in particular rely to significant extent upon google to generate business and to much lesser extent other search engine and other travel demand aggregation website search engine such google frequently update and change the logic which determines the placement and display of result of user search such that the placement of link to our site and particularly those of booking com agoda rentalcars com and their affiliate can be negatively affected in similar way significant amount of booking com agoda and rentalcars com business is directed to our own website through participation in pay per click advertising campaign on internet search engine whose pricing and operating dynamic can experience rapid change commercially technically and competitively in addition we purchase web traffic from number of source including some operated by our competitor in the form of pay per click arrangement that can be terminated with little or no notice if one or more of such arrangement is terminated or if major search engine such google change it algorithm in manner that negatively affect the search engine ranking of our brand or our third party distribution partner or change it pricing operating or competitive dynamic in negative manner our business result of operation and financial condition would be adversely affected in addition booking com agoda and rentalcars com rely on various third party distribution channel affiliate to distribute hotel room reservation should one or more of such third party cease distribution of booking com agoda and rentalcars com reservation or suffer deterioration in it search engine ranking due to change in search engine algorithm or otherwise our business could be negatively affected capacity constraint and system failure could harm our business we have experienced rapid growth in customer traffic the number of hotel on our extranets and the geographic breadth of our operation if our system can not be expanded to cope with increased demand or fails to perform we could experience unanticipated disruption in service slower response time decreased customer service and customer satisfaction and delay in the introduction of new service any of which could impair our reputation damage our brand and materially and adversely affect our revenue while we do maintain redundant system and hosting service for some of our business it is possible that we could experience an interruption in our business and we do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate for loss that may occur substantial amount of our computer hardware for operating our service is currently located at hosting facility around the world these system and operation are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error flood fire power loss telecommunication failure and similar event they are also subject to break in sabotage intentional act of vandalism and similar misconduct despite any precaution we may take the occurrence of any disruption of service due to any such misconduct natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at such facility or the failure by such facility to provide our required data communication capacity could result in lengthy interruption or delay in our service any system failure that cause an interruption or delay in service could impair our reputation damage our brand name and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we rely on certain third party computer system and third party service provider including global distribution system and computerized central reservation system of the airline hotel and rental car industry to satisfy demand for airline ticket and priceline com hotel room and rental car reservation any interruption in these third party service system or deterioration in their performance could prevent from booking airline hotel and rental car reservation and have material adverse effect on our business our agreement with some third party service provider are terminable upon short notice and often do not provide recourse for service interruption in the event our arrangement with any of such third party is terminated we may not be able to find an alternative source of system support on timely basis or on commercially reasonable term and result it could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition we depend upon various third party to process credit card transaction around the world in addition we rely on third party to provide credit card number which we use payment mechanism for merchant hotel transaction if any such third party were wholly or partially compromised our cash flow could be disrupted or we may not be able to generate merchant hotel transaction until such time replacement process could be put in place with different vendor of contentswe do not have completely formalized disaster recovery plan in every geographic region in which we conduct business in the event of certain system failure we may not be able to switch to back up system immediately and the time to full recovery could be prolonged like many online business we have experienced system failure from time to time in addition to placing increased burden on our engineering staff these outage create significant amount of user question and complaint that need to be addressed by our customer support personnel any unscheduled interruption in our service could result in an immediate loss of revenue that can be substantial increase customer service cost and cause some user to switch to our competitor if we experience frequent or persistent system failure our reputation and brand could be permanently harmed we have taken and continue to take step to increase the reliability and redundancy of our system these step are expensive may reduce our margin and may not be successful in reducing the frequency or duration of unscheduled downtime we use both internally developed system and third party system to operate our service including transaction processing order management and financial system if the number of user of our service increase substantially or if critical third party system stop operating designed we will need to significantly expand and upgrade our technology transaction processing system financial and accounting system and other infrastructure we may not be able to upgrade our system and infrastructure to accommodate such condition in timely manner and depending on the third party system affected our transactional financial and accounting system could be impacted for meaningful amount of time before upgrade expansion or repair our financial result will likely be materially impacted by payment of cash income tax in the future until our domestic net operating loss carryforwards are utilized or expire we do not expect to make tax payment on our income except for federal alternative minimum tax and state income tax however we expect to pay foreign tax on our foreign income we expect that our international operation will grow their pretax income at higher rate than our operation over the long term and therefore we expect that our cash tax payment will increase our international operation generate an increasing share of our pretax income we may have exposure to additional tax liability an international corporation providing travel reservation service around the world we are subject to income tax well non income based tax in both the united state and various foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe that our tax estimate are reasonable there is no assurance that the final determination of tax audit or tax dispute will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual the internal revenue service initiated an audit of our income tax for the first time in the third quarter of to date we have been audited in several taxing jurisdiction with no significant adjustment result if future audit find that additional tax are due we may be subject to incremental tax liability possibly including interest and penalty which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation change in tax law or

fund held by our foreign subsidiary to the united state at favorable tax rate difficulty in transferring fund from or converting currency in certain country and reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country our business ha grown substantially over the last several year and continues to expand into new geographical location in addition we have made effort and expect to make further effort to integrate supply across our various demand platform these change add to complexity in tax compliance and our increased size and operating history may increase the likelihood that we will be subject to audit by taxing authority in various jurisdiction of contentsin addition the strategy of booking com agoda and rentalcars com involves rapid expansion into region around the world

company and or hotel room reservation wholesaler relating to the fixed or minimum resale price of hotel room reservation in september booking com and priceline com incorporated on behalf of booking com received notice of inquiry from the oft we and booking com are cooperating with the oft investigation we are unable at this time to predict the outcome of the oft investigation and the impact if any on our business and result of operation compliance with foreign legal regulatory or tax requirement will place demand on our time and resource and we may nonetheless experience unforeseen and potentially adverse legal regulatory or tax consequence we will be subject to increased income tax in the event that our foreign cash balance are remitted to the united state of december we held approximately billion of cash and short term investment outside of the united state to date we have used our foreign cash to reinvest in our foreign operation it is our current intention to reinvest our foreign cash in our foreign operation if our foreign cash balance continue to grow and our ability to reinvest those balance diminishes it will become increasingly likely that we will repatriate some of our foreign cash balance to the united state in such event we would likely be subject to additional income tax expense in the united state with respect to our unremitted foreign earnings other than federal alternative minimum tax and certain state income tax we would not incur an increase in tax payment unless we repatriate the cash and no longer have net operating loss carryforwards available to offset the taxable income additionally if we were to repatriate foreign cash to the it would use portion of our domestic net operating loss carryforward which could result in being subject to cash income tax on the earnings of our domestic business sooner than would otherwise have been the case in addition president barack obama ha proposed significant change to the international tax law that would limit deduction for interest expense related to un repatriated foreign source income and modify the foreign tax credit rule we can not determine whether all of these proposal will be enacted into law or what if any change may be made to such proposal prior to being enacted into law if the tax law change in manner that increase our tax obligation our result could be adversely impacted we face risk related to our intellectual property we regard our intellectual property critical to our success and we rely on trademark copyright and patent law trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreement with our employee customer partner and others to protect our proprietary right if we are not successful in protecting our intellectual property it could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition while we believe that our issued patent and pending patent application help to protect our business there can be no assurance that third party will not have or obtain one or more patent that can prevent from practicing feature of our business or that will require to pay for license to use those feature our operation do not or will not infringe valid enforceable patent of third party any patent can be successfully defended against challenge by third party the pending patent application will result in the issuance of patent competitor or potential competitor will not devise new method of competing with that are not covered by our patent or patent application because of variation in the application of our business model to each of our service our patent will be effective in preventing one or more third party from utilizing copycat business model to offer the same service in one or more category of content new prior art will not be discovered that may diminish the value of or invalidate an issued patent or legislative or judicial action will not directly or indirectly affect the scope and validity of any of our patent right there ha been recent discussion in the press regarding the examination and issuance of so called business method patent result the united state patent and trademark office ha indicated that it intends to intensify the review process applicable to such patent application the new procedure are not expected to have direct effect on patent already granted we can not anticipate what effect if any the new review process will have on our pending patent application in addition there ha been recent discussion in various federal court proceeding regarding the patentability and validity of so called business method patent the supreme court in recent decision in bilski kappos partially addressed the patentability of so called business method patent we can not anticipate what effect if any any new federal court decision or new legislation will have on our issued patent or pending patent application we pursue the registration of our trademark and service mark in the and internationally however effective trademark service mark copyright and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our service are made available online we have licensed in the past and expect to license in the future certain of our proprietary right such trademark or copyrighted material to third party these licensee may take action that might diminish the value of our proprietary right or harm our reputation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business we have been subject to and are currently subject to legal proceeding and claim relating to the intellectual property right of others and we expect that third party will continue to assert intellectual property claim in particular patent claim against particularly we expand the complexity and scope of our business we endeavor to defend our intellectual property right diligently but intellectual property litigation is extremely expensive and time consuming and ha and is likely to continue to divert managerial attention and resource from our business objective successful infringement claim against could result in significant monetary liability or prevent from operating our business or portion of our business in addition resolution of claim may require to obtain license to use intellectual property right belonging to third party which may be expensive to procure or possibly to cease using those right altogether any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition our business is exposed to risk associated with processing credit card transaction our result have been negatively impacted by purchase made using fraudulent credit card because we act the merchant of record in majority of our priceline com transaction well those of agoda and rentalcars com we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card on our website well other payment dispute with our customer additionally we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit card in certain retail transaction when we do not act merchant of record accordingly we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card chargebacks if we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit card on our website our business result of operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition in the event that one of our major supplier voluntarily or involuntarily declares bankruptcy we could experience an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with travel reservation with such supplier for example airline that participate in our system and declare bankruptcy or cease operation may be unable or unwilling to honor ticket sold for their flight our policy in such event is to direct customer seeking refund or exchange to the airline and not to provide remedy because we are the merchant of record on sale of name your own price airline ticket to our customer however we could experience significant increase in demand for refund or credit card chargebacks from customer which could materially adversely affect our operation and financial result for example in april aloha airline and ata airline each ceased operation and we experienced an increase in credit card chargebacks from customer with ticket on those airline agoda and rentalcars com process credit card transaction and operate in numerous currency credit card cost are typically higher for foreign currency transaction and in instance where cancellation occur we are party to legal proceeding which if adversely decided could materially adversely affect we are party to the legal proceeding described in item below and note to the consolidated financial statement the defense of the action described in item and note may increase our expense and an adverse outcome in any of such action could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation of contentsitem unresolved staff comment none item property our executive administrative and operating office and network operation center are located in approximately square foot of leased office space located in norwalk connecticut we also lease approximately square foot of office space in grand rapid michigan booking com limited lease approximately square foot of office space in cambridge england booking com lease approximately square

existing facility are adequate to meet our current requirement and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available needed to accommodate any further expansion of corporate operation item legal proceeding litigation related to hotel occupancy and other taxeswe and certain third party defendant online travel company are currently involved in approximately fifty lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and our merchant hotel business our subsidiary lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the defendant violated each jurisdiction respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint typically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief we are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition approximately sixty municipality or county and at least six state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter we believe that the ordinance at issue do not apply to the service we provide namely the facilitation of reservation and therefore that we do not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather we believe that the ordinance at issue generally impose hotel occupancy and other tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation in addition in many of these matter municipality have asserted claim for conversion essentially that we have collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that we believe is without basis and have vigorously contested the municipality that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time we have found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment we may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the ordinance in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city of san francisco assessed approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which we paid in july payment of these amount if any is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such tax and even if such payment are made we intend to continue to assert our position vigorously we have successfully argued against pay first requirement asserted in another california proceeding litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in october jury in san antonio class action found that we and the other online travel company that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance on july the court issued finding of fact and of contentsconclusions of law in connection with this case in addition to ruling that hotel tax wa due from defendant on the markup and service fee the court held defendant liable for penalty and interest per the term of each city applicable ordinance but capped penalty at fifteen percent of the total amount of unpaid tax at the time of entry of judgment ordinance without penalty provision are assessed fifteen percent penalty under the texas tax code we expect supplemental finding of fact and conclusion of law to be issued by the court followed by judgment we intend to vigorously pursue an appeal of the judgment on legal and factual ground an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation and could be material to our earnings or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have such responsibility with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for it service on merchant hotel transaction either step could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation we estimate that since our inception through december we have earned aggregate gross profit including fee from our entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for our service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this gross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that we believe have aggregate tax rate which may include hotel occupancy tax state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date municipality seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on our gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to our liability for tax owed on our historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate hotel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to municipality that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis reserve for hotel occupancy and other taxesas result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual for the potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other tax in the amount of approximately million of december compared to approximately million of december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in san antonio the accrual is based on our estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving these issue the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made development in the year ended december the year ended december and to date

regarding forward looking statement this discussion contains forward looking statement which involve risk and uncertainty our actual result may differ materially from the result discussed in the forward looking statement factor that might cause those difference include but are not limited to those discussed in risk factor overviewwe are leading online travel company that offer our customer hotel room reservation at over hotel worldwide through the booking com priceline com and agoda brand in the united state we also offer our customer reservation for car rental airline ticket vacation package destination service and cruise through the priceline com brand we offer car rental reservation worldwide through rentalcars com formerly known traveljigsaw which we acquired in may we launched our business in the united state in under the priceline com brand and have since expanded our operation to include the booking com agoda and rentalcars com company our principal goal is to serve our customer with worldwide leadership in online hotel and rental car reservation our business is driven primarily by international result during the year ended december our international business the significant majority of which is generated by booking com represented approximately of our gross booking an operating and statistical metric referring to the total dollar value generally inclusive of all tax and fee of all travel service purchased by our customer and approximately of our consolidated operating income given that the business of our international operation is primarily comprised of hotel reservation service gross profit earned in connection with the reservation of hotel room night represents substantial majority of our gross profit our priceline com brand in the offer merchant name your own price travel service sometimes referred to opaque travel service which are recorded in revenue on gross basis and have associated cost of revenue retail or price disclosed travel service offered by both our and international brand are recorded in revenue on net basis and have no associated cost of revenue therefore revenue increase and decrease are impacted by change in the mix of our revenue between name your own price and retail travel service gross profit reflects the net margin earned for both our name your own price and retail travel service consequently gross profit ha become an increasingly important measure of evaluating growth in our business at present we derive substantially all of our gross profit from the following source commission earned from price disclosed hotel room reservation rental car cruise and other travel service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our price disclosed merchant hotel room and rental car reservation service transaction gross profit and customer processing fee from our name your own price hotel room reservation rental car and airline ticket service well our vacation package service global distribution system gd reservation booking fee related to both our name your own price airline ticket hotel room reservation and rental car service and price disclosed airline ticket and rental car service and other gross profit derived primarily from selling advertising on our website over the last several year we have experienced strong growth in the number of hotel room night reservation booked through our hotel reservation service we believe this growth is the result of among other thing the broader shift of travel purchase from offline to online the high growth of travel overall in emerging market such asia pacific and south america and the continued innovation and execution by our team around the world to build hotel supply content and distribution and to improve the customer experience on our website we experienced exceptionally strong year over year growth during however given the sheer size of our hotel reservation business we believe it is highly likely that our year over year growth rate will generally decelerate on quarterly sequential basis in the future thus far during the first quarter of we experienced deceleration in year over year hotel room night reservation growth compared to the year over year growth rate of contentsin the fourth quarter of we expect to experience further deceleration in growth rate throughout and beyond in addition many government around the world including the and certain european government are operating at very large financial deficit governmental austerity measure aimed at reducing deficit could impair the economic recovery and adversely affect travel demand weak economic growth and elevated unemployment rate in the economy of such country could cause contribute to or be indicative of deteriorating macro economic condition recently we have experienced volatility in the growth rate for transaction booked and cancellation for our international business we have also observed decline in transaction growth rate and weaker trend in hotel average daily rate adrs for certain southern european country likely due to the impact of weak economic condition and sovereign debt concern this volatility make it more difficult to predict longer term trend and the future impact of macro economic weakness on our business finally higher oil price are contributing to higher airline ticket price and are likely to adversely impact consumer discretionary fund available to be spent on travel large established internet search engine with substantial resource and expertise in developing online commerce and facilitating internet traffic are creating and intend to further create inroad into online travel both in the and internationally for example following it acquisition of ita software inc major flight information software company google recently launched new flight search tool that enables user to find fare schedule and availability directly on google and excludes online travel agent ota participation within the search result google ha also invested in homeaway publicly traded vacation home rental service and launched hotel finder utility that allows user to search and compare hotel accommodation based on parameter set by the user in addition microsoft ha launched bing travel which search for airfare and hotel reservation online and predicts the best time to purchase them meta search site leverage their search technology to aggregate travel search result for the searcher specific itinerary across supplier travel agent and other website and in many instance compete directly with for customer furthermore certain supplier limit ota participation within the meta search result some meta search site such kayak com which offer it user the ability to make hotel reservation directly on it website may evolve into more traditional online travel site these initiative among others illustrate clear intention to more directly appeal to travel consumer by showing consumer more detailed travel search result including specific information for traveler own itinerary which could lead to supplier or others gaining larger share of search traffic or may ultimately lead to search engine maintaining transaction within their own website if google the single largest search engine in the world or bing or other leading search engine refer significant traffic to these or other travel service that they develop in the future it could result in among other thing more competition from supplier website and higher customer acquisition cost for third party site such ours and could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition several major hotel company including choice hotel international hilton worldwide hyatt intercontinental hotel group wyndham hotel group and marriott have launched room key hotel search engine that competes directly with our hotel room night reservation service around the world the hotel company that own room key have stated goal of driving demand directly to their brand web site thus reducing the share received by online travel agency they may also attempt to improve their competitive position by offering lower room rate better room availability or additional feature or amenity through room key than are available through service like ours if room key is successful our share of the online hotel room night reservation market could be negatively affected in the united state and around the world and our business could suffer hotel also are increasingly offering hotel room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social which sell coupon to customer at substantial discount expedia recently entered into partnership with groupon to sell hotel room reservation to groupon customer under the groupon getaway brand name if these new service are successful we may experience le demand for our service and are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate international trend the size of the travel market outside of the united state is substantially greater than that within the united state historically internet adoption rate and commerce adoption rate of international consumer have trailed those of the united state however international consumer are rapidly moving to online mean for purchasing travel accordingly recent international online travel growth rate have substantially exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed the growth rate within the united state we expect that over the long term international online travel growth rate will follow similar trend to that experienced in the united state in addition the base of hotel supplier in europe and asia is particularly fragmented compared to that in the united state where the hotel market is dominated by large hotel chain we believe online reservation system like ours may be more appealing to small chain and independent hotel more commonly found outside of the united state our growth ha primarily been generated by our international hotel reservation service brand booking com and agoda booking com our most significant brand currently includes over hotel and accommodation on it website compared to about hotel and accommodation last year updated hotel count are of contentsavailable on the booking com website booking com ha added hotel over the past year in it core european market well higher growth market such north america which is newer market for booking com asia pacific and south america an increasing amount of our business from both destination and point of sale perspective is conducted in these newer market which are growing faster than our overall growth rate we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow our business exists for the market in which we operate we believe these trend and factor have enabled to become the top online hotel reservation service provider in the world measured by room night booked our international operation have become significant contributor to our result and international hotel booking have become of increased importance to our earnings we have seen and expect to continue to see change in certain of our operating expense and other financial metric for example because booking com and agoda utilize online search and affiliate marketing the principal mean of generating traffic to their website our online advertising expense ha increased significantly over recent year trend we expect to continue throughout and beyond in addition certain newer market in which we operate that are in earlier stage of development have lower operating margin compared to more mature market which could have negative impact on our overall margin these market increase in size over time also we intend to continue to invest in hotel addition many of these newer property we add especially in highly penetrated market may have fewer room or lower adrs and may appeal to smaller subset of customer for example hostel and bed and breakfast and therefore may also negatively impact our margin over time another impact of the growing importance of booking com agoda and rentalcars com is our increased exposure to foreign currency exchange risk because we are conducting significant and growing portion of our business outside the united state and are reporting our result in dollar we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency principally the euro and the british pound sterling into dollar upon consolidation strengthening of the euro increase our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar while weakening of the euro decrease our euro denominated net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income expressed in dollar greece ireland portugal and certain other european union country with high level of sovereign debt have had difficulty refinancing their debt concern around devaluation or abandonment of the euro common currency or that sovereign default risk may be more widespread and could include the ha led to significant volatility in the exchange rate between the euro the dollar and other currency we generally enter into derivative instrument to minimize the impact of short term currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result however such derivative instrument are short term in nature and not designed to hedge against currency fluctuation that could impact our foreign currency denominated gross booking revenue or gross profit see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on our derivative contract for example while revenue from our international operation grew on local currency basis by approximately for the year ended december compared to the same period in result of the positive impact of currency exchange rate revenue from our international operation reported in dollar grew year over year domestic trend competition in domestic online travel remains intense and traditional online travel company are creating new promotion and consumer value feature in an effort to gain competitive advantage in particular the competition to provide opaque hotel service to consumer an area in which priceline com ha been leader ha become more intense over the recent past for example in the fourth quarter of expedia began making opaque hotel room reservation available on it principal website under the name expedia unpublished rate and ha been supporting the initiative with national television advertising campaign in addition in travelocity launched an opaque price disclosed hotel booking service that allows customer to book room at discount with our name your own price hotel booking service for these service the name of the hotel is not disclosed until after purchase we believe these new offering in particular expedia unpublished rate have adversely impacted the market share and year over year growth rate for our opaque hotel service which experienced modest decline in room night reservation in compared to in addition hotel are increasingly offering discounted hotel room reservation through daily deal website such groupon and living social if expedia or travelocity are successful in growing their opaque hotel service and or daily deal website are successful in garnering sizable share of discounted hotel booking we may have le consumer demand for our opaque hotel service over time and we are likely to face more competition for access to the limited supply of discounted hotel room rate result we believe our share of the discount hotel market in the could further decrease we believe that for number of reason including the recent significant year over year increase in retail airfare consumer are engaging in increased shopping behavior before making travel purchase than they engaged in previously increased shopping behavior reduces our advertising efficiency and effectiveness because traffic becomes le likely to result in purchase on our website and such traffic is more likely to be obtained through paid online advertising channel than through free direct channel of contentswhile demand for online travel service in the continues to experience annualized growth we believe that the domestic market share of third party distributor is impacted in part by concerted initiative by travel supplier to direct customer to their own website in an effort to reduce distribution expense and establish more direct control over their pricing the launch of room key discussed above is demonstrative of such effort in addition certain supplier have attempted to charge additional fee to customer who book airline reservation through an online channel other than their own website supplier who sell on their own website typically do not charge processing fee and in some instance offer advantage such web only fare bonus mile or loyalty point which could make their offering more attractive to consumer than model like ours some travel supplier are encouraging third party travel intermediary such to develop technology to bypass the traditional gd such enabling direct connection to the travel supplier or using alternative global distribution method for example in we enabled direct connection with american airline during american airline content wa temporarily unavailable on expedia and orbitz due to dispute related to enabling direct connection we believe that this is consistent with an effort on the part of american airline and the airline industry in general to reduce distribution cost and could be indicative of the airline in general becoming more aggressive in requiring online travel agent to implement direct connection development and implementation of the technology to enable additional direct connection to travel supplier could cause to incur additional operating expense increase the frequency duration of system problem and delay other project in addition any additional migration toward direct connection would reduce the compensation we receive from gd domestic airline have reduced capacity and increased fare since the latter part of trend which may continue decrease in capacity reduce the amount of airline ticket available while significant increase in average airfare over the last two year have adversely impacted leisure travel demand reduced airline capacity and demand negatively impact our priceline com air business which in turn ha negative repercussion on our priceline com hotel and rental car business our rental car business is further impacted by decrease in rental car fleet which ha negatively impacted our name your own price rental car service we expect continued variability in the breadth and depth of discounted airline ticket and rental car rate made available to in the future depending on market condition from time to time seasonality meaningful amount of retail gross booking are generated early in the year customer plan and reserve their spring and summer vacation in europe and north america however we do not recognize associated revenue until future quarter when the travel occurs from cost perspective we expense the substantial majority of our advertising activity they are incurred which is typically in the quarter in which booking are generated result we typically experience our highest level of profitability in the second and third quarter of the year which is when we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for the year for our north american and european business however we experience the highest level of booking and travel consumption for our asia pacific and south american business in the first and fourth quarter therefore if these business continue to grow faster than our north american and european business our operating result for the first and fourth quarter of the year may become more significant over time percentage of full year operating result in addition our name your own price service are generally non refundable in nature and accordingly we recognize travel revenue at the time booking is generated however we recognize revenue generated from our retail hotel service including booking com and agoda at the time that the customer check out of the hotel therefore if our retail hotel business continues to grow we expect our quarterly result to become increasingly impacted by these seasonal factor other factor we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain profitability primarily from our hotel business to continue to promote the booking com agoda and rentalcars com brand internationally and the priceline com brand in the united state and over time to offer other travel service and further expand into other international market factor beyond our control such worldwide recession higher oil price terrorist attack unusual weather pattern natural disaster such earthquake hurricane tsunami flood volcanic eruption such the april eruption of volcano in iceland travel related health concern including pandemic and epidemic such influenza avian bird flu and sars political instability regional hostility imposition of tax or surcharge by regulatory authority travel related accident or the withdrawal from our system of major hotel supplier or airline could adversely affect our business and result of operation and impair our ability to effectively implement all or some of the initiative described above for example in early japan wa struck by major earthquake tsunami and nuclear emergency japan is an important source of travel demand for agoda and these crisis have had an adverse impact on travel demand originating in japan and demand for japanese destination in october severe flooding in thailand key market for our agoda business and the asian business of booking com negatively impacted booking volume and cancellation rate in this market in addition in early thailand experienced disruptive civil unrest which caused the temporary relocation of agoda thailand based operation future natural disaster or civil or political unrest could further disrupt our business and operation of contentsin thailand we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion technology and personnel within parameter consistent with attempt to improve long term operating result we also intend to broaden the scope of our business and to that end we explore strategic alternative from time to time in the form of among other thing merger and acquisition our goal is to improve volume and sustain margin in an effort to maintain profitability the uncertain environment described above make the prediction of future result of operation difficult and accordingly we can not provide assurance that we will sustain gross profit growth and profitability critical accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation are based upon the consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america our significant accounting policy and estimate are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement certain of our accounting policy and estimate are particularly important to our financial position and result of operation and require to make difficult and subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate of matter that are inherently uncertain in applying those policy our management us it judgment to determine the appropriate assumption to be used in the determination of certain estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to the item described below those estimate are based on among other thing historical experience term of existing contract our observance of trend in the travel industry and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance our actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition our significant accounting policy that involve significant estimate and judgment of management include the following deferred tax valuation allowance we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax asset and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax asset by valuation allowance to the extent we believe portion will not be realized we consider many factor when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax asset including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction expectation of future income the carryforward period available to for tax reporting purpose and other relevant factor based on management assessment of positive and negative evidence we recorded non cash tax benefit in of million resulting from the reversal of portion of our valuation allowance on deferred tax asset the net deferred tax asset at december amounted to million the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted in the future if fact and circumstance change causing reassessment of the amount of deferred tax asset more likely than not to be realized accounting for state and local hotel occupancy tax discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement we are currently involved in over fifty lawsuit brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and our merchant hotel business we are also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition over sixty municipality or county and at least six state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that we are subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively historically we have not collected hotel occupancy or other tax on the gross profit earned from merchant hotel transaction however in handful of jurisdiction we have been recently required by passage of new statute or court order to start collecting and remitting certain tax local occupancy and or sale tax imposed upon our margin and or service fee the ultimate resolution of these matter in all jurisdiction can not be determined at this time we have established an accrual for potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other tax for prior and current period consistent with applicable accounting principle and in light of all current fact and circumstance we accrue for legal contingency where it is probable that loss ha occurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated our legal expense for these matter are expensed incurred and are not reflected in the amount accrued variety of factor could affect the amount of the liability both past and future which factor include but are not limited to the number of and amount of gross profit represented by jurisdiction that ultimately assert claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate settlement and change in relevant statute the ultimate resolution of these matter may be greater or le than the liability recorded of content stock based compensation we record stock based compensation expense for equity based award over the recipient service period based upon the grant date fair value of the award number of our equity award have performance target performance contingency which if satisfied can increase the number of share issued to the recipient at the end of the performance period or in certain instance if not satisfied reduce the number of share issued to the recipient sometimes to zero at the end of the performance period the performance period for our performance based equity award are typically three year we record stock based compensation expense for these performance based award based upon our estimate of the probable outcome at the end of the performance period the estimated performance against the performance target we periodically adjust the cumulative stock based compensation recorded when the probable outcome for these performance based award is updated based upon change in actual and forecasted operating result stock based compensation for the year ended december and includes charge amounting to million and million respectively representing the cumulative impact of adjusting the estimated probable outcome of unvested performance share unit our actual performance against the performance target could differ materially from our estimate we record stock based compensation expense net of estimated forfeiture in determining the estimated forfeiture rate we periodically review actual and projected forfeiture to the extent that actual or projected forfeiture rate differ from current estimate such amount are recorded cumulative adjustment in the period in which the estimate is revised valuation of goodwill we have recorded goodwill related to business we have acquired goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment using appropriate valuation technique in the event that future circumstance indicate that any portion of our goodwill is impaired an impairment charge would be recorded substantial amount of our goodwill relates to our acquisition of booking com the estimated fair value for booking com well our other reporting unit is substantially in excess of their respective carrying value since the annual impairment test in september there have been no event or change in circumstance to indicate potential impairment valuation of long lived asset and intangible we evaluate whether event or circumstance have occurred which indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset and intangible may be impaired the significant factor that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include change in business strategy market condition or the manner of use of an asset under performance relative to historical or expected future operating result and negative industry or economic trend in evaluating an asset for possible impairment management estimate that asset future undiscounted cash flow to measure whether the carrying value of the asset is recoverable if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable we measure the impairment based upon the fair value of the asset compared to it carrying value the fair value represents the projected discounted cash flow of the asset over it remaining life recent accounting pronouncementsin december the financial accounting standard board fasb issued guidance for new disclosure requirement regarding company right of offset and related arrangement associated with financial instrument and derivative instrument the new disclosure are designed to make financial statement that were prepared under gaap more comparable to those prepared under international financial reporting standard ifrs the new disclosure requirement are effective for annual reporting period beginning on or after january and interim period therein retrospective application is required in september the fasb issued an accounting update which amends the guidance on testing goodwill for impairment under the revised guidance entity testing goodwill for impairment have the option of performing qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit if based on the qualitative factor it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value then the unchanged two step approach previously used would be required the new accounting guidance doe not change goodwill is calculated how goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or the requirement for testing goodwill annually or when event and circumstance warrant testing the accounting update is effective for annual and interim period beginning after december early adoption of the update is permitted during the three month ended september we performed our annual quantitative goodwill impairment testing and concluded that the estimated fair value for each reporting unit substantially exceeds it respective carrying value this new accounting guidance will not have significant impact on of contentsin june the fasb issued amended accounting guidance on the presentation of other comprehensive income in financial statement by requiring comprehensive income to be reported in either single statement or in two consecutive statement reporting net income and other comprehensive income this accounting update also required reclassification adjustment out of other comprehensive income to be presented in both the income statement and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented both in interim and annual period in december the fasb issued another accounting update which indefinitely defers the requirement to separately present reclassification adjustment on the face of the financial statement during the deferral period company that doe not display reclassification adjustment on the face of the financial statement must disclose such adjustment in the note to the financial statement the accounting guidance did not change the item that constitute net income or other comprehensive income the timing of when other comprehensive income is reclassified to net income or the earnings per share computation the accounting update requires retrospective application public entity will be required to adopt the guidance for fiscal year and interim period within those year beginning after december with early adoption permitted we intend to comply with the change in presentation of other comprehensive income in the financial statement beginning in the first quarter of in may the fasb issued amended guidance on fair value to largely achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirement between gaap and ifrs the new accounting guidance doe not extend the use of fair value but rather provides guidance about how fair value should be determined for gaap most of the change are clarification of existing guidance or wording change to align with ifrs amendment that clarify the board intent under existing requirement include use of the highest and best use and valuation premise concept should be limited to nonfinancial asset disclosure should include quantitative information about the unobservable input used in fair value measurement that is categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy and the fair value of an instrument classified in an entity equity should be valued from the perspective of market participant that hold that instrument an asset the amended guidance change requirement follows disclosure are expanded particularly those relating to fair value measurement based on unobservable input fair value measurement for financial asset and liability based on net position are permitted if market or credit risk are managed on net basis and other criterion are met and premium and discount are allowed only if market participant would also include them in the fair value measurement this accounting update is effective for public company for interim or annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted we expect to make the additional disclosure required in result of operation year ended

tax to date the majority of taxing jurisdiction in which we facilitate the making of hotel room reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on our merchant hotel business with respect to jurisdiction that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from only on prospective basis see item legal proceeding and note to the consolidated financial statement for description of these pending case and proceeding and item risk factor adverse application of state and local tax law could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in this annual report we are vigorously defending against these claim and proceeding however litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost which could have material adverse effect on our cash flow in any given operating period also there have been and will continue to be ongoing cost associated with defending our position in pending and any future case or proceeding of contentsto the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that we have tax collection responsibility or we determine that we have one with respect to future transaction we may collect any such additional tax obligation from our customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to our customer and consequently could make our hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively we could choose to reduce the compensation for our service on merchant hotel transaction either step could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax we have established an accrual which amounted to approximately million and million of december and respectively the accrual is based on our estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving these issue the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded we believe that even if we were to suffer adverse determination in the near term in more of the pending proceeding than currently anticipated given result to date because of our available cash it would not have material impact on our liquidity the following table represents our material contractual obligation and commitment of december see note to the consolidated financial statement payment due by period in thousand contractual obligation total le year to to year more than yearsoperating lease obligation debt revolving credit facility

to our accrual for potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other hotel related transaction tax refer to note to the consolidated financial statement and approximately million related to unrecognized tax benefit refer to note to the consolidated financial statement variety of factor could affect the timing of payment for these liability we believe that these matter will likely not be resolved in the next twelve month and accordingly we have classified the estimated liability non current on the consolidated balance sheet we have excluded other long term liability in the amount of million from the contractual obligation table because we can not reasonably estimate the timing of such payment since the contingent conversion threshold for the convertible senior note due wa exceeded of december these note are convertible at the option of the holder if the holder elect to convert we will be required to pay the aggregate principal amount in cash and we will deliver cash or share of common stock at our option for the conversion value in excess of the aggregate principal amount we would likely fund our conversion obligation with cash and cash equivalent short term investment and borrowing under our revolving credit facility we believe that our existing cash balance and liquid resource will be sufficient to fund our operating activity capital expenditure and other obligation through at least the next twelve month however if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operation or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amount and on term acceptable to we may be required to reduce our planned capital expenditure and scale back the scope of our business plan either of which could have material adverse effect on our future financial condition or result of operation if additional fund were raised through the issuance of equity security the percentage ownership of our then current stockholder would be diluted there are no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future that revenue growth or sustained profitability will be realized or that future borrowing or equity sale will be available in amount sufficient to make anticipated capital expenditure finance our strategy or repay our indebtedness of contentsoff balance sheet

capital expenditure or capital resource item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we manage our exposure to interest rate risk and foreign currency risk through internally established policy and procedure and when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instrument we use foreign exchange derivative contract to manage short term foreign currency risk the objective of our policy is to mitigate potential income statement cash flow and fair value exposure resulting from possible future adverse fluctuation in rate we evaluate our exposure to market risk by assessing the anticipated near term and long term fluctuation in interest rate and foreign exchange rate this evaluation includes the review of leading market indicator discussion with

not party to any leveraged derivative to the extent that change in interest rate and currency exchange rate affect general economic condition the priceline group would also be affected by such change we did not experience any material change in interest rate exposure during the year ended december based upon economic condition and leading market indicator at december we do not foresee significant adverse change in interest rate in the near future fixed rate investment are subject to unrealized gain and loss due to interest rate volatility we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the fair value of our available for sale investment assuming an adverse change of basis point hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate would have resulted in decrease in the fair value of our investment of december of approximately million these hypothetical loss would only be realized if we sold the investment prior to their maturity of december the outstanding principal amount of our debt is million we estimate that the market value of such debt wa approximately billion of december substantial portion of the market value of our debt in excess of the outstanding principal amount is related to the conversion premium on our outstanding convertible bond result of the growth of booking com and agoda and the acquisition of rentalcars com we are conducting significant portion of our business outside the united state through subsidiary with functional currency other than the dollar primarily euro result we face exposure to adverse movement in currency exchange rate the financial result of our international operation are translated from local currency into dollar upon consolidation if the dollar weakens against the local currency the translation of these foreign currency denominated balance will result in increased net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income similarly our net asset gross booking gross profit operating expense and net income will decrease if the dollar strengthens against local currency additionally foreign exchange rate fluctuation on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency result in gain and loss that are reflected in the consolidated statement of operation booking com agoda and rentalcars com are subject to risk typical of international business including but not limited to differing economic condition change in political climate differing tax structure other regulation and restriction and foreign exchange rate volatility from time to time we enter into foreign exchange derivative contract to minimize the impact of short term foreign currency fluctuation on our consolidated operating result our derivative contract principally address foreign exchange fluctuation risk for the euro and the british pound sterling of december there were no outstanding derivative contract of december these derivative which were not designated hedging instrument for accounting purpose resulted in liability of million recorded in accrued expense and other current liability foreign exchange gain of million and million for the year ended december and respectively and foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december were recorded in foreign currency transaction and other in the consolidated statement of operation of contentsas of december and we had outstanding forward currency contract designated hedging contract for accounting purpose with notional value of million euro and million euro respectively to hedge portion of our net investment in foreign subsidiary these contract are all short term in nature mark to market adjustment on these net investment hedge are recorded currency translation adjustment the fair value of these derivative at december wa an asset of million and wa recorded in prepaid expense and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet the net fair value of these derivative at december wa net liability of million with asset of million recorded in prepaid expense and other current asset and liability of million recorded in accrued expense and other current liability in the consolidated balance sheet hypothetical strengthening of the foreign exchange rate relative to the dollar with all other variable held constant would have resulted in

lawsuit including certified and putative class action brought by or against state city and county over issue involving the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and the company merchant hotel business the company subsidiary lowestfare com llc and travelweb llc are named in some but not all of these case generally each complaint alleges among other thing that the defendant violated each jurisdiction respective hotel occupancy tax ordinance with respect to the charge and remittance of amount to cover tax under each law each complaint of contentstypically seek compensatory damage disgorgement penalty available by law attorney fee and other relief the company is also involved in one consumer lawsuit relating to among other thing the payment of hotel occupancy tax and service fee in addition approximately sixty municipality or county and at least six state have initiated audit proceeding including proceeding initiated by more than forty municipality in california issued proposed tax assessment or started inquiry relating to the payment of hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax additional state and local jurisdiction are likely to assert that the company is subject to among other thing hotel occupancy and other tax state and local sale tax and could seek to collect such tax retroactively and or prospectively with respect to the principal claim in these matter the company belief that the ordinance at issue do not apply to the service it provides namely the facilitation of reservation and therefore that it doe not owe the tax that are claimed to be owed rather the company belief that the ordinance at issue generally impose hotel occupancy and other tax on entity that own operate or control hotel or similar business or furnish or provide hotel room or similar accommodation in addition in many of these matter municipality have asserted claim for conversion essentially that the company ha collected tax and wrongfully pocketed those tax dollar claim that the company belief is without basis and ha vigorously contested the municipality that are currently involved in litigation and other proceeding with the company and that may be involved in future proceeding have asserted contrary position and will likely continue to do so from time to time the company ha found it expedient to settle and may in the future agree to settle claim pending in these matter without conceding that the claim at issue are meritorious or that the claimed tax are in fact due to be paid in connection with some of these tax audit and assessment the company may be required to pay any assessed tax which amount may be substantial prior to being allowed to contest the assessment and the applicability of the ordinance in judicial proceeding this requirement is commonly referred to pay to play or pay first for example the city of san francisco assessed the company approximately million an amount that includes interest and penalty relating to hotel occupancy tax which the company paid in july payment of these amount if any is not an admission that the company belief it is subject to such tax and even if such payment are made the company intends to continue to assert it position vigorously the company ha successfully argued against pay first requirement asserted in another california proceeding litigation is subject to uncertainty and there could be adverse development in these pending or future case and proceeding for example in october jury in san antonio class action found that the company and the other online travel company that are defendant in the lawsuit control hotel for purpose of the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance at issue and are therefore subject to the requirement of those ordinance on july the court issued finding of fact and conclusion of law in connection with this case in addition to ruling that hotel tax wa due from defendant on the markup and service fee the court held defendant liable for penalty and interest per the term of each city applicable ordinance but capped penalty at fifteen percent of the total amount of unpaid tax at the time of entry of judgment ordinance without penalty provision are assessed fifteen percent penalty under the texas tax code the company expects supplemental finding of fact and conclusion of law to be issued by the court followed by judgment the company intends to vigorously pursue an appeal of the judgment on legal and factual ground an unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation may encourage the commencement of additional litigation audit proceeding or other regulatory inquiry in addition an unfavorable outcome or settlement of these action or proceeding could result in substantial liability for past and or future booking including among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost there have been and will continue to be substantial ongoing cost which may include pay first payment associated with defending the company position in pending and any future case or proceeding an adverse outcome in one or more of these unresolved proceeding could have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation and could be material to the company earnings or cash flow in any given operating period to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that the company ha tax collection responsibility or the company determines that it ha such responsibility with respect to future transaction the company may collect any such additional tax obligation from it customer which would have the effect of increasing the cost of hotel room reservation to it customer and consequently could make the company hotel service le competitive versus the website of other online travel company or hotel company website and reduce hotel reservation transaction alternatively the company could choose to reduce the compensation for it service on merchant hotel transaction either step could have material adverse effect on the company business and result of operation the company estimate that since it inception through december it ha earned aggregate gross profit including fee from it entire merchant hotel business which includes among other thing the differential between the price paid by customer for the company service and the cost of the underlying room of approximately billion this of contentsgross profit wa earned in over thousand taxing jurisdiction that the company belief have aggregate tax rate which may include hotel occupancy tax state and local tax among other tax associated with typical transaction between consumer and hotel that generally range from approximately to approximately depending on the jurisdiction in many of the judicial and other proceeding initiated to date municipality seek not only historical tax that are claimed to be owed on the company gross profit but also among other thing interest penalty punitive damage and or attorney fee and cost therefore any liability associated with hotel occupancy tax matter is not constrained to the company liability for tax owed on it historical gross profit but may also include among other thing penalty interest and attorney fee to date the majority of the taxing jurisdiction in which the company facilitates hotel reservation have not asserted that tax are due and payable on the company merchant hotel business with respect to municipality that have not initiated proceeding to date it is possible that they will do so in the future or that they will seek to amend their tax statute and seek to collect tax from the company only on prospective basis reserve for hotel occupancy and other tax result of this litigation and other attempt by jurisdiction to levy similar tax the company ha established an accrual for the potential resolution of issue related to hotel occupancy and other tax in the amount of approximately million of december compared to approximately million of december which includes among other thing amount related to the litigation in san antonio the accrual is based on the company estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving these issue the actual cost may be le or greater potentially significantly than the liability recorded an estimate for possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued can not be reasonably made development in the year ended december in the year ended december and to date six of the approximately fifty currently pending lawsuit and seven of the total number of currently
