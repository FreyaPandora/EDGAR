are excluded from the table above excludes million of noncurrent unrecognized tax benefit due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash tax payment off balance sheet arrangementswe have no material off balance sheet arrangement critical accounting policiesour significant accounting policy are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statement the following discussion address our most critical accounting policy which are those that are both important to the of contentsrepresentation of our financial condition and result of operation and that require significant judgment or use of significant assumption or complex estimate merchandise inventorieswe value the substantial majority of our inventory under the retail inventory method using the first in first out method with the remainder of our inventory valued under cost method under the retail inventory method inventory are stated at cost which is determined by applying cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventory the retail value of our inventory is adjusted needed to reflect current market condition because these adjustment are based on current prevailing market condition the value of our inventory approximates the lower of cost or market the valuation under the retail inventory method is based on number of factor such markup markdowns and inventory loss or shrink such there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross profit we determine markup and markdowns based on the consideration of variety of factor such current and anticipated demand customer preference and buying trend age of the merchandise and weather condition we calculate shrink based on actual inventory loss determined result of physical inventory count during each fiscal period and estimated inventory loss which occur between physical inventory count the estimate for shrink in the interim period between physical inventory count is calculated on store specific basis based on recent shrink result and current trend in the business historically the difference between estimated shrink and actual inventory loss ha not been material to our annual financial result we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood for material change in the estimate or assumption we use to value our inventory under the retail inventory method we believe that the retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which approximates cost and result in valuing our inventory at the lower of cost or market impairment of long lived assetswe evaluate our long lived asset each quarter for indicator of potential impairment indicator of impairment include current period loss combined with history of loss our decision to relocate or close store or other location before the end of it previously estimated useful life or when change in other circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable the evaluation for long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally the individual store level the asset of store with indicator of impairment are evaluated for recoverability by comparing their undiscounted future cash flow with their carrying value our cash flow projection look several year into the future and include assumption of variable such future sale and operating margin growth rate economic condition market competition and inflation if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted future cash flow we then measure the asset fair value to determine whether an impairment loss should be recognized if the resulting fair value is le than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized we generally base our estimate of fair market value on market appraisal of owned location and estimate of the amount of potential sublease income and the time required to sublease for leased location impairment and lease obligation cost on closing and relocation were not material to our consolidated financial statement in fiscal fiscal or fiscal self insurancewe have established liability for certain loss related to general liability including product liability worker compensation employee group medical and automobile claim for which we are self insured our self insured retention or deductible applicable for each claim involving general liability worker compensation and automobile liability is limited to million million and million respectively we have no stop loss limit for self insured employee group medical claim our liability represent estimate of the ultimate cost for claim incurred at the balance sheet date the estimated liability are not discounted and are established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimate the liability are reviewed by management and third party actuary to ensure that they are appropriate while we believe these estimate are reasonable based on the information currently available if actual trend including the severity or frequency of claim medical cost inflation or fluctuation in premium differ from our estimate our result of operation could be impacted actual result related to these type of claim did not vary materially from estimated amount for fiscal fiscal or fiscal vendor allowance vendor allowance primarily consist of volume rebate that are earned result of attaining certain purchase level and co op advertising allowance for the promotion of vendor product that are typically based on of contentsguaranteed minimum amount with additional amount earned for attaining certain purchase level these vendor allowance are accrued earned with those allowance received result of attaining certain purchase level accrued over the incentive period based on estimate of purchase we believe that our estimate of vendor allowance earned based on expected volume of purchase over the incentive period is an accurate reflection of the ultimate allowance to be received from our vendor volume rebate and certain co op advertising allowance reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sale when the related inventory is sold certain other co op advertising allowance that are reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to promote vendor product are recorded an offset against advertising expense in sg uncertain tax position we are subject to income tax in the united state and in multiple jurisdiction across our global operation thus the determination of our provision for income tax requires significant judgment the use of estimate and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our provision for income tax could be affected by many factor including change in business operation change in tax law outcome of income tax audit change in our assessment of certain tax contingency the impact of discrete tax item and the mix of earnings among our and foreign operation the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with complexity and thus there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain the assessment of uncertain tax position requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item we record the benefit of uncertain tax position in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will be sustained additional informationfor information on accounting pronouncement that have impacted or are expected to materially impact our financial condition result of operation or cash flow see note to our consolidated financial statement item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk in connection with our long term debt portfolio we use interest rate swap agreement to manage our fixed floating rate debt portfolio at february after giving consideration to our interest rate swap agreement floating rate debt principal wa billion or approximately of our long term debt portfolio percentage point change in the interest cost of floating rate debt would not have material impact on our financial condition or result of operation the united kingdom financial conduct authority ha announced the intent to phase out the use of libor by the end of when libor is discontinued we may need to renegotiate the term of certain of our floating rate note interest rate swap agreement and credit instrument which utilize libor benchmark in determining the interest rate to replace libor with the new standard that is established result we may incur incremental cost in transitioning to new standard and interest rate on our current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected by the new standard decision have not been finalized regarding the future utilization of libor or any particular replacement rate such the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital can not yet be determined but we do not expect it to have material impact on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or cash flow foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our foreign operation into dollar and on the purchase of good by these foreign operation that are not denominated in their local currency revenue from these foreign operation accounted for approximately billion of our revenue for fiscal our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is not material to our financial condition or result of operation commodity price risk we experience inflation and deflation related to our purchase of certain commodity product this price volatility could potentially have material impact on our financial condition and or our result of operation in order to mitigate price volatility we monitor commodity price fluctuation and may adjust our selling price accordingly however our ability to recover higher cost through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate we currently do not use derivative instrument to
