aerospace and defense company well numerous smaller competitor change within the industry we operate in such vertical integration by our peer could negatively impact we often form team with our competitor in effort to provide our customer with the best mix of capability to address specific requirement in area of our business customer of contentsrequirements are changing to encourage expanded competition principal factor of competition include the value of our product and service to the customer technical and management capability the ability to develop and implement complex integrated system architecture total cost of ownership our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirement and our ability to provide timely solution technological advance in such area additive manufacturing cloud computing advanced material autonomy robotics and big data and new business model such commercial access to space are enabling new factor of competition for both traditional and non traditional competitor the competition for international sale is generally subject to government stipulation export restriction market access technology transfer industrial cooperation and contracting practice we may compete against and non company or team for contract award by international government international competition also may be subject to different law or contracting practice of international government that may affect we structure our bid for the procurement in many international procurement the purchasing government relationship with the and it industrial cooperation program are also important factor in determining the outcome of competition is common for international customer to require contractor to comply with their industrial

commonly referred to government use right see the discussion of matter related to our intellectual property within item risk factor foreign government may also have certain right in patent and other intellectual property developed in performance of foreign government contract although our intellectual property right in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business we not believe that any existing patent license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that it loss or termination would have material adverse effect on our business taken whole raw material and seasonalitysome of our product require relatively scarce raw material historically we have been successful in obtaining the raw material and other supply needed in our manufacturing process we seek to manage raw material supply risk through long term contract and by maintaining an acceptable level of the key material in inventory aluminum and titanium are important raw material used in certain of our aeronautics and space program long term agreement have helped enable continued supply of aluminum and titanium carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite material used in our aeronautics program such the aircraft we have been advised by some supplier that pricing and the timing of availability of material in some commodity market fluctuate widely fluctuation may negatively affect the price and availability of certain material we do not anticipate material problem regarding the supply of our raw material and believe that we have taken appropriate measure to mitigate these variation if key material become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future it could result in delay of one or more of our program increased cost or reduced operating profit no material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal various factor can affect the distribution of our sale accounting period including the timing of government award the availability of government funding

security involves risk and uncertainty we seek to identify manage and mitigate risk to our business risk and uncertainty can not be eliminated or necessarily predicted the outcome of one or more of these risk could have material effect on our operating result financial position or cash flow should carefully consider the following factor in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form deciding to purchase our common stock or debt security we depend heavily on contract with the government for substantial portion of our business we derived of our total net sale from the government in including from the department of defense dod we expect to continue to derive most of our sale from work performed under government contract those contract are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriation congress usually appropriates fund on fiscal year fy basis even though contract performance may extend over many year consequently contract are often partially funded initially and additional fund are committed only congress make appropriation if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of those cost unless and additional fund are obligated to the contract discussed within industry consideration government funding in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation on january congress passed and the president signed legislation that fully fund the government through february ending partial government shutdown which not include our largest customer the dod but did include other customer such nasa the underlying budget impasse remains and it is possible that there will be further partial shutdown or shutdown noted above while the corporation largest customer the dod is funded through the end of the government fy and thus would not be affected by another shutdown limiting the direct impact of any future shutdown or shutdown on lockheed martin other customer such nasa are not in the event of future shutdown we may continue to work on unfunded contract to seek to maintain their projected cost and schedule profile which although we would anticipate being paid when the shutdown end would put at risk of nonpayment further there may be indirect impact such the potential diversion of fund from the dod and the fact that the department of state and commerce cease to timely process export license while in the recent shutdown there were procedure in place to process on an emergency basis license involving direct support to the military humanitarian aid or other similar emergency there wa growing backlog of non emergency application we anticipate that this will occur in any future shutdown while the impact on lockheed martin of the recent shutdown wa not material were future shutdown to occur and continue for an extended period this might not be the case in addition the president ha not yet submitted budget proposal for fy to congress if an annual appropriation bill is not enacted for fy or beyond the government may operate under continuing resolution restricting new contract or program start and additional government shutdown which might involve all government agency could arise in addition continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cut remain unless the budget control act is repealed or significantly modified the is our largest program and represented of our total net sale in and is expected to represent higher percentage of our sale in future year decision to cut spending or reduce planned order would have an adverse impact on our business and result of operation given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review related to aircraft performance program schedule cost and requirement part of the dod congressional and international partner oversight and budgeting process current program challenge include but are not limited to supplier and partner performance including the potential that decision by the government not to allow delivery of aircraft to turkey could disrupt the substantial supplier activity in our turkish supply chain software development receiving funding for production contract on timely basis executing future flight test and finding resulting from testing and operating the aircraft level of cost associated with life cycle operation and sustainment and warranty and continuing to reduce the unit cost of producing aircraft and achieve cost target based upon our diverse range of defense homeland security and information technology product and service generally we believe that this make it le likely that cut in any specific contract or program will have long term effect on our business however termination of multiple or large program or contract could adversely affect our business and future financial performance potential change in funding priority may afford new or additional opportunity for our business in term of existing follow on or replacement program while we would expect to compete and be well positioned the incumbent on existing program we may not be successful or the replacement program may be funded at lower level of contentswe are subject to number of procurement law and regulation our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we fail to comply with these law we must comply with and are affected by law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of government contract government contract law and regulation affect how we do business with our customer and impose certain risk and cost on our business violation of specific law and regulation by our employee others working on our behalf supplier or venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fine and penalty the termination of our contract suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contract loss of our ability to export product or service and civil or criminal investigation or proceeding in some instance these law and regulation impose term or right that are different from those typically found in commercial transaction for example the government may terminate any of our government contract and subcontract either at it convenience or for default based on our performance upon termination for convenience of fixed price type contract typically we are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered item reimbursement for allowable cost for work in process and an allowance for profit on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in loss upon termination for convenience of cost reimbursable contract we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable cost plus portion of the fee where allowable cost include our cost to terminate agreement with our supplier and subcontractor the amount of the fee recovered if any is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation we attempt to ensure that adequate fund are available by notifying the customer when it estimated cost including those associated with possible termination for convenience approach level specified being allotted to it program fund are typically appropriated on fiscal year basis and the cost of termination for convenience may exceed the cost of continuing program in given fiscal year occasionally program do not have sufficient fund appropriated to cover the termination cost if the government were to terminate them for convenience under such circumstance the government could assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding termination arising of our default may expose to liability and have material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contract and order in addition on those contract for which we are teamed with others and are not the prime contractor the government could terminate prime contract under which we are subcontractor notwithstanding the quality of our service subcontractor in the case of termination for default the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost and could ass other special penalty however under such circumstance we have right and remedial action under law and the federal acquisition regulation far in addition certain of our government contract span one or more base year and multiple option year the government generally ha the right not to exercise option period and may not exercise an option period for various reason however the government may exercise option period even for contract for which it is expected that our cost may exceed the contract price or ceiling government agency including the defense contract audit agency the defense contract management agency and various agency inspector general routinely audit and investigate government contractor these agency review contractor performance under it contract it cost structure it business system and compliance with applicable law regulation and standard the government ha the ability to decrease or withhold certain payment when it deems system subject to it review to be inadequate additionally any cost found to be misclassified may be subject to repayment we have unaudited and or unsettled incurred cost claim related to past year which place risk on our ability to issue final billing on contract for which authorized and appropriated fund may be expiring if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we may be subject to civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction including reduction of the value of contract contract modification or termination forfeiture of profit suspension of payment penalty fine and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against similar government oversight exists in most other country where we conduct business our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contract and program our performance our ability to control cost and evolving government procurement policy our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the type of government contract undertaken the nature of product produced or service performed under those contract the cost incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objective and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fee is determined particularly under award and incentive fee contract our backlog includes variety of contract type and represents the sale we expect to recognize for our product and service in the future contract type primarily include fixed price and cost reimbursable contract of contentsunder fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee not vary with actual cost contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are typically cost reimbursable in these case the associated financial risk primarily relate to reduction in fee and the program could be canceled if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise other contract in backlog are for the transition from development to production low rate initial production lrip contract which includes the challenge of starting and stabilizing manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated these generally are cost reimbursable or fixed price incentive fee contract generally if our cost exceed the contract target cost or are not allowable under the applicable regulation we may not be able to obtain reimbursement for all cost and may have our fee reduced or eliminated there are also contract for production well operation and maintenance of the delivered product that have the challenge of achieving stable production and delivery rate while maintaining operability of the product after delivery these contract are mainly fixed price the failure to perform to customer expectation and contract requirement may result in reduced fee or loss and affect our financial performance in that period under each type of contract if we are unable to control cost our operating result could be adversely affected particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customer cost overrun or the failure to perform on existing program also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing program and win future contract award the government could implement policy that could negatively impact our profitability change in procurement policy favoring more incentive based fee arrangement different award fee criterion or government contract negotiation offer based upon the customer view of our cost should be compared to our actual cost may affect the predictability of our profit rate our customer also may pursue non traditional contract provision in negotiation of contract in some circumstance the government is proposing position that are inconsistent with the far and existing practice the dod is currently seeking the view of expert and interested party within the government and the private sector regarding revising policy and procedure for contract financing performance incentive and associated regulation for dod contract and we have no assurance regarding what change will be proposed if any and their impact on our working capital and cash flow earlier change proposed by the dod and later withdrawn would have had negative impact on the timing of our cash flow additionally the government is taking increasingly aggressive position under the far and defense federal acquisition regulation supplement dfars both to what intellectual property they believe government use right apply and to acquire broad license right if the government is successful in these effort this could affect our ability to compete and to obtain access to and use certain supplier intellectual property increased competition and bid protest in budget constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and customer relationship substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding the government increasingly ha relied upon competitive contract award type including indefinite delivery indefinite quantity and other multi award contract which have the potential to create pricing pressure and increase our cost by requiring that we submit multiple bid and proposal multi award contract require that we make sustained effort to obtain task order under the contract additionally recent competitive bid have not contained cost realism evaluation criterion leading to our competitor taking aggressive pricing position the competitive bidding process entail substantial cost and managerial time to prepare bid and proposal for contract that may not be awarded to or may be split among competitor additionally the government may fail to award large competitive contract in an effort to maintain broader industrial base following award we may encounter significant expense delay contract modification or bid protest from

anticipate that the most probable near term effect are likely to reflect the pressure brexit is placing on the uk government which may influence the government ability to make decision on large complex program of the type we perform brexit may also have adverse tax effect on movement of product or sustainment activity between the uk and eu additionally brexit may impact the value of the pound sterling if the pound sterling were to remain depressed against the dollar this could negatively impact the ability of the uk government to afford our product currently we do not anticipate that brexit will have material impact on our operation or our financial result while we have operation in the uk these operation have little activity between the uk and the eu sale supply chain or reliance on personnel additionally our practice is to substantially hedge all of our currency exposure therefore we do not have material currency exposure to the pound sterling or the euro additionally

offset agreement may require the establishment of venture with local company which must control the venture the cost to satisfy our offset obligation are included in the estimate of our total cost to complete the contract and may impact our profitability and cash flow the ability to recover investment that we make is generally dependent upon the successful operation of venture that we do not control and may involve product and service that are dissimilar to our business activity in these and other situation we could be liable for violation of law for action taken by these entity such law related to anti corruption import and export taxation and anti boycott restriction offset agreement generally extend over several year and may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in

their relationship with government contractor such lockheed martin may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threat we face we have approximately direct supplier and even more indirect supplier with wide variety of system and cybersecurity capability and we may not be successful in preventing adversary from exploiting possible weak link in our supply chain we also must

reduce the effect of our operation on the environment we manage and have managed various government owned facility on behalf of the government at such facility environmental compliance and remediation cost historically have been the responsibility of the government we have relied and continue to rely with respect to past practice upon government funding to pay such cost notwithstanding effort by some government representative to limit this responsibility although the government remains responsible for capital and operating cost associated with environmental compliance responsibility for fine and penalty associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the government or the contractor depending on the contract and the relevant fact some environmental law include

part on our ability to adapt to changing customer need rapidly identify emerging technological trend develop and manufacture innovative product and service and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective of contentsprices due to the complex nature of the product and service we offer we may experience technical difficulty during the development of new product or technology these technical difficulty could result in delay and higher cost which may negatively impact our financial result until such product or technology are fully developed see note significant accounting policy

will be successful or meet the need of our customer additionally our competitor may develop new technology or offering or more efficient way to produce existing product that could cause our existing offering to become obsolete if we fail in our development project or if our new product or technology fail to achieve customer acceptance our ability to procure new contract could be unsuccessful and this could negatively impact our financial result due to the specialized nature of our business our future performance is highly dependent upon our ability to maintain workforce with the requisite skill in multiple area including engineering science manufacturing information technology cybersecurity business development and strategy and management our operating performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearance and receive substantial training in order to work on certain program or task additionally we expand our operation internationally it is increasingly important to hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local law regulation custom tradition and business practice we face number of challenge that may affect personnel retention such our

substantial portion of our workforce including personnel in leadership position are retirement eligible or nearing retirement we previously amended certain of our defined benefit pension plan for non union employee to freeze future retirement benefit the freeze which will be completed january may encourage retirement eligible personnel generally age or older to choose to retire earlier than anticipated to the extent that we lose experienced personnel it is critical that we develop other employee hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of critical knowledge competition for personnel is intense and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining personnel with the requisite skill or clearance we increasingly compete with commercial technology company outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical cyber and scientific position the number of qualified domestic engineer is decreasing and the number of cyber professional is not keeping up with demand to the extent that these company grow at faster rate or face fewer cost and product pricing constraint they may be able to offer more attractive compensation and other benefit to candidate or our existing employee to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training cost in order to attract and retain such employee we could experience difficulty in performing our contract if we were unable to do so we also must manage leadership development and succession planning throughout our business while we have process in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge the loss of key personnel coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel hire new personnel or transfer knowledge could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contract approximately of our employee are covered by collective bargaining agreement with various union historically where

work stoppage could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contract which could negatively impact our result of operation cash flow and financial condition our estimate and projection may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our asset may be at risk of future impairment the accounting for some of our most significant activity is based on judgment and estimate which are complex and subject to many variable for example accounting for sale using the percentage of completion method requires that we ass risk and make assumption regarding schedule cost technical and performance issue for thousand of contract many of which are long term in nature additionally we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired business based on preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed for significant acquisition we may use one year measurement period to analyze and ass number of factor used in establishing the asset and liability fair value of the acquisition date and could result in adjustment to asset and liability balance we have billion of goodwill asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december from previous

significant change in circumstance that indicate goodwill may be impaired if we experience change or factor arise that negatively affect the expected cash flow of reporting unit we may be required to write off all or portion of the reporting unit related goodwill asset the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit are closely aligned therefore any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or market pressure could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to decline below current projection and could cause goodwill and intangible asset to be impaired additionally sikorsky may not perform expected or demand for it product may be adversely affected by global economic condition including oil and gas trend that are outside of our control future change in or foreign tax law including those with retroactive effect and audit by tax authority could result in unanticipated increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow the amount of net

and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing the business this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contract management ass the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and monitor performance on our contract in similar manner through their completion we regularly provide customer with report of our cost the contract progress the cost information in the report is accumulated in manner specified by the requirement of each contract for example cost data provided to customer for product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such wing box on an aircraft and for service would align to the type of work being performed such aircraft sustainment our contract generally allow for the recovery of cost in the pricing of our product and service most of our contract are bid and negotiated with our customer under circumstance in which we are required to disclose our estimated total cost to provide the product or service this approach for negotiating contract with our government customer generally allows for the recovery of our cost we also may enter into long term supply contract for certain material or component to coincide with the production schedule of certain product and to ensure their availability at known unit price many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding of contentsthe technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate we have number of program that are designated classified by the government which can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are included in our consolidated and business segment result and are subjected to the same oversight and internal control our other program our net sale are primarily derived from long term contract for product and service provided to the government well fm contracted through the government we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied change in net sale and operating profit generally are expressed in term of volume change in volume refer to increase or decrease in sale or operating profit resulting from varying production activity level or service level on individual contract volume change in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for particular contract in addition comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract accounted for using the percentage of completion method of accounting increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to complete and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter severance and restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset segment operating profit and item such risk retirement reduction of profit booking rate or other matter are presented net of state income tax previously disclosed we have program eadge to design integrate and install an air missile defense command control communication computer intelligence system for an international customer that ha experienced performance matter and for which we have periodically accrued reserve in we revised our estimated cost to complete the eadge contract consequence of ongoing performance matter and recorded an additional charge of million million or per share after tax at our rms business segment which resulted in cumulative loss of approximately million on this program of december cumulative loss remained at approximately million we continue to monitor program requirement and our performance at this time we do not anticipate additional charge that would be material to our operating result or financial condition we have two commercial satellite program for the delivery of three satellite in total to international customer at our space business segment for which we have experienced performance issue related to the development and integration of modernized lm satellite platform these program require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm power propulsion and electronics among other item the enhanced lm satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite program we have periodically revised our estimated cost to complete these developmental commercial program we have recorded cumulative loss of approximately million through december in we recorded loss of approximately million million or per share after tax while these loss reflect our estimated total loss on the program we will continue to incur general and administrative cost each period until we complete these program these program remain developmental and further challenge in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology anomaly discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework further schedule delay and potential penalty could require that we record additional loss reserve which could be material to our operating result we previously disclosed that we did not meet the july delivery requirement for two satellite the customer could seek to exercise termination right one of the satellite ha now been launched eliminating this risk the other is expected to launch in the first half of we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do so were the customer to seek to exercise termination right and be successful in this effort we would have to refund the payment we have received and pay certain penalty on the third satellite we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise termination right although we may have to pay certain penalty and have sought to address this possibility in our reserve of contentswe are responsible for designing developing and installing an upgraded turret for the warrior capability sustainment program in we revised our estimated cost to complete the program consequence of performance issue and recorded charge of approximately million million or per share after tax at our mfc business segment which resulted in cumulative loss of approximately million on this program of december we may continue to experience issue related to customer requirement and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charge however based on the loss already recorded and our current estimate of the sale and cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional loss if any would be material to our operating result or financial condition our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustment and other item net of state income

liquidity and cash flowswe have balanced cash deployment strategy to enhance stockholder value and position to take advantage of new business opportunity when they arise consistent with that strategy we have continued to invest in our business including capital expenditure independent research and development and selective business acquisition and investment while returning cash to stockholder through dividend and share repurchase and managing our debt level maturity and interest rate and pension obligation we have generated strong operating cash flow which have been the primary source of funding for our operation capital expenditure debt service and repayment dividend share repurchase and postretirement benefit plan contribution our strong operating cash flow enabled our board of director to approve two key cash deployment initiative in september first we increased our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by to per share second the board of director approved billion increase to our share repurchase program inclusive of this increase the total remaining authorization for future common share repurchase under our program wa billion of december we expect our cash from operation will continue to be sufficient to support our operation and anticipated capital expenditure for the foreseeable future however we expect to continue to issue commercial paper backed by our billion revolving credit facility to manage the timing of cash flow we also have additional access to credit market if needed for liquidity or general corporate purpose and letter of credit to support customer advance payment and for other trade finance purpose such guaranteeing our performance on particular contract see our capital structure resource and other section below for discussion on available financial resource we made contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in including required and discretionary contribution result of these contribution we do not expect to make contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in we funded these contribution in using mix of cash on hand and commercial paper of contentsduring we received one time tax free special cash payment of approximately billion result of the divestiture of the is business in the third quarter of we used the proceeds to repay million of long term note at their scheduled maturity and paid million in dividend with portion of this cash the remainder wa used for share repurchase cash received from customer either from the payment of invoice for work performed or for advance in excess of cost incurred is our primary source of cash we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer however we may determine to fund customer program ourselves pending government appropriation and are doing so with increased frequency if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on the contract we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess cost billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable contract which represent approximately of the sale we recorded in we are authorized to bill the cost are incurred number of our fixed price contract may provide for performance based payment which allow to bill and collect cash we perform on the contract the amount of performance based payment and the related milestone are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract the timing of such payment may differ from our incurrence of cost related to our contract performance thereby affecting our cash flow the government ha indicated that it would consider progress payment the baseline for negotiating payment term on fixed price contract rather than performance based payment in contrast to negotiated performance based payment term progress payment provision correspond to percentage of the amount of cost incurred during the performance of the contract while the total amount of cash collected on contract is the same performance based payment have had more favorable impact on the timing of our cash flow in addition our cash flow may be affected if the government decides to withhold payment on our billing while the impact of withholding payment delay the receipt of cash the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract will not vary the majority of our capital expenditure for and those planned for are for equipment facility infrastructure and information technology expenditure for equipment and facility infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing program across all of our business segment for example we have project underway in our aeronautics business segment for facility and equipment to support higher production of the combat aircraft and we have project underway to modernize certain of our facility we also incur capital expenditure for information technology to support program and general enterprise information technology infrastructure inclusive of cost for the development or purchase of internal use

adjustment change in working capital other net cash provided by operating activity cash used for investing activity net cash used for financing activity net change in cash and cash equivalent and cash equivalent at end of year compared to net cash provided by operating activity decreased billion in compared to primarily due to contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in and an increase in cash used for working capital of million partially offset by an increase in net earnings and decrease in income tax payment the increase in cash used for working capital wa largely driven by the timing of cash collection for the program and sikorsky helicopter program we received net income tax refund of million during the year ended december compared to making net income tax

establishment of venture with local company and building or leasing facility for in country operation we typically do not commit to offset agreement until order for our product or service are definitive the amount ultimately applied against our offset agreement are based on negotiation with the customer and typically require cash outlay that represent only fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement satisfaction of our offset obligation are included in the estimate of our total cost to complete the contract and may impact our sale profitability and cash flow our ability to recover investment on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligation is generally dependent upon the successful operation of venture that we do not control and may involve product and service that are dissimilar to our business activity at december the notional value of remaining obligation under our outstanding offset agreement totaled approximately billion which primarily relate to our aeronautics mfc and rms business segment most of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligation at december that also satisfy offset agreement those amount are included in the preceding table offset program usually extend over several year and may provide for penalty estimated at approximately billion at december in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirement while historically we have not been required to pay material penalty resolution of offset requirement are often the result of negotiation and subjective judgment in connection with our ownership interest of ula we and the boeing company boeing were previously required to provide ula an additional capital contribution if ula wa unable to

of credit surety bond and third party guarantee in million commitment expiration by period total commitment le year and and after year standby letter of credit bond third party guarantee commitment approximately million of standby letter of credit in the le than year category million in the year and category and million in the year and category are expected to renew for additional period until completion of the contractual obligation at december third party guarantee totaled million of which approximately related to guarantee of contractual performance of venture to which we currently are or previously were party this amount represents our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the venture venture partner or divested business generally we also have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of venture partner in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation performance on contractual obligation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former venture partner and the transferee under novation agreement all of which include guarantee required by the far there were no material amount recorded in our financial statement related to third party guarantee or novation agreement of contentscritical accounting policiescontract accounting sale recognitionthe majority of our net sale are generated from long term contract with the government and international customer including foreign military sale fm contracted through the government for the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system product and service we provide our product and service under fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost we account for contract after it ha been approved by all party to the arrangement the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable we ass each contract at it inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contract when making this determination we consider factor such whether two or more contract were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective if combined we treat the combined contract single contract for revenue recognition purpose we evaluate the product or service promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for one or more performance obligation the product and service in our contract are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationship and the significant contract management function required to perform under the contract accordingly our contract are typically accounted for one performance obligation in limited case our contract have more than one distinct performance obligation which occurs when we perform activity that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles significant judgment is required in determining performance obligation and these decision could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the performance obligation we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the product or service being provided under the contract for contract where portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk at the inception of contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current right and do not contemplate future modification including unexercised option or follow on contract until they become legally enforceable contract are often subsequently modified to include change in specification requirement or price which may create new or change existing enforceable right and obligation depending on the nature of the modification we consider whether to account for the modification an adjustment to the existing contract or separate contract generally modification to our contract are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated task provided in the context of the contract therefore such modification are accounted for if they were part of the existing contract and recognized cumulative adjustment to revenue for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to customer on standalone basis not bundled with any other product or service our contract with the government including fm contract are subject to the federal acquisition of contentsregulations far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual cost plus reasonable profit margin result of these regulation the standalone selling price of product or service in our contract with the government and fm contract are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract for non government contract with multiple performance obligation we evaluate whether the stated selling price for the product or service represent their standalone selling price we primarily sell customized solution unique to customer specification when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligation we typically use the expected cost plus reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service we occasionally sell standard product or service with observable standalone sale transaction in these situation the observable standalone sale transaction are used to determine the standalone selling price we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service in determining when performance obligation are satisfied we consider factor such contract term payment term and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfer continuously to the customer for contract with the government and fm contract this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit and take possession of any work in process our non government contract primarily international direct commercial contract typically do not include termination for convenience provision however continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reason other than our non performance we would have the right to recover damage which would include among other potential damage the right to payment for our work performed to date plus reasonable profit to deliver product or service that do not have an alternative use to for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the performance obligation for performance obligation to provide service to the customer revenue is recognized over time based on cost incurred or the right to invoice method in situation where the value transferred match our billing right our customer receives and consumes the benefit for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point significant estimate and assumption are made in estimating contract sale and cost including the profit booking rate at the outset of long term contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract well variable consideration and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead general and administrative and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset or localization agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase or our estimate of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating of contentsprofit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset other contract accounting considerationsthe majority of our sale are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to produce product or perform service under contract with the government cost based pricing is determined under the far the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service under government contract for example cost such those related to charitable contribution interest expense and certain advertising and public relation activity are unallowable and therefore not recoverable through sale in addition we may enter into advance agreement with the government that address the subject of allowability and allocability of cost to contract for specific matter for example most of the environmental cost we incur for environmental remediation related to site operated in prior year are allocated to our current operation general and administrative cost under far provision and supporting advance agreement reached with the government we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policy related to contract accounting cost incurred and allocated to contract are reviewed for compliance with government regulation by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency postretirement benefit plansoverviewmany of our employee participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan see note postretirement benefit plan included in our note to consolidated financial statement the majority of our accrued benefit obligation relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plan and retiree medical and life insurance plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefit we currently expect to pay to plan participant based on past service in june we amended certain of our qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for non union employee comprising the majority of our benefit obligation to freeze future retirement benefit the calculation of retirement benefit under the affected defined benefit pension plan is determined by formula that take into account the participant year of credited service and average compensation the freeze take effect in two stage on january the pay based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit wa frozen so that future pay increase annual incentive bonus or other amount earned for or related to period after december are not used to calculate retirement benefit on january the service based component of the formula used to determine retirement benefit will also be frozen so that participant will no longer earn further credited service for any period after december when the freeze is complete the majority of our salaried employee will have transitioned to an enhanced defined contribution retirement saving plan additionally in recent year we have taken other action to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial result for example in december lockheed martin qualified defined benefit pension plan purchased two contract from insurance company covering billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligation first in december an upfront cash payment of million wa made to an insurance company in exchange for contract referred to buy in contract that will reimburse the plan for all future benefit payment related to million of the plan outstanding defined benefit pension obligation for approximately retiree and beneficiary on december the approximately retiree and beneficiary and the buy in contract were spun off to another plan with the buy in contract the sole asset of that plan under the arrangement the plan remains responsible for paying the benefit for the covered retiree and beneficiary and the insurance company will reimburse the plan those benefit are paid result there is no net ongoing cash flow to the plan for the covered retiree and beneficiary the cost of providing the benefit is funded by the buy in contract effectively locking in the cost of the benefit and eliminating future volatility of the benefit obligation the buy in contract wa purchased using asset from the pension trust and is accounted for at fair value an investment of the trust this transaction had no impact on our fa pension expense or ca pension cost the difference of approximately million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligation funded by the buy in contract wa recognized through the re measurement of the related benefit obligation in other comprehensive loss in equity and will be amortized of contentsto fa pension expense in future period we intend to begin the termination process for this plan during and at conclusion convert the buy in contract to buy out contract thus relieving of liability for the pension obligation related to the covered population the buy out conversion expected to occur early will require recognition of settlement loss in earnings at that time which we currently estimate will be approximately million subsequent cash recovery is anticipated from the government also during december we purchased an irrevocable group annuity contract from an insurance company referred to buy out contract for billion to settle billion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligation related to certain retiree and beneficiary the group annuity contract wa purchased using asset from the pension trust result of this transaction we were relieved of all responsibility for these pension obligation and the insurance company is now required to pay and administer the retirement benefit owed to approximately retiree and beneficiary with no change to the amount timing or form of monthly retirement benefit payment although the transaction wa treated settlement for accounting purpose we did not recognize loss on the settlement in earnings associated with the transaction because total settlement during for this plan were le than this plan service and interest cost in accordingly the transaction had no impact on our fa pension expense or ca pension cost and the difference of approximately million between the amount paid to the insurance company and the amount of the pension obligation settled wa recognized in other comprehensive loss and will be amortized to fa pension expense in future period notwithstanding these action the impact of these plan and benefit on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because those calculation are sensitive to funding level well change in several key economic assumption including interest rate actual rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity and employee turnover well the timing of cash funding actuarial assumptionsthe plan asset and benefit obligation are measured at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event such significant plan amendment settlement or curtailment the amount we record are measured using actuarial valuation which are dependent upon key assumption such discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset participant longevity employee turnover and the health care cost trend rate for our retiree medical plan the assumption we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligation of the measurement date and the calculation of net periodic benefit cost in subsequent period when reassessing these assumption we consider past and current market condition and make judgment about future market trend we also consider factor such the timing and amount of expected contribution to the plan and benefit payment to plan participant we continue to use single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligation related to our defined benefit pension plan resulting in at december compared to at december and at december we utilized single weighted average discount rate of when calculating our benefit obligation related to our retiree medical and life insurance plan at december compared to at december and at december we evaluate several data point in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate including result from cash flow model quoted rate from long term bond index and change in long term bond rate over the past year part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yield on corporate bond rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flow we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan asset of at december compared to for both december and december the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected long term rate of return on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the benefit obligation this assumption is based on several factor including historical market index return the anticipated long term allocation of plan asset the historical return data for the trust fund plan expense and the potential to outperform market index return the difference between the long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select and the actual return on plan asset in any given year affect both the funded status of our benefit plan and the calculation of fa pension expense in subsequent period although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption the average expected return over long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption any variance in given year should not by suggest that the assumption should be changed pattern of variance are reviewed over time and then combined with expectation for the future result change in this assumption are le frequent than change in the discount rate in both october and the society of actuary published revised longevity assumption that refined it prior study we used the revised assumption indicating shortened longevity in our december and december re measurement of benefit obligation the publication were refinement to assumption the society of actuary published in previous year beginning in of contentsour stockholder equity ha been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of postretirement benefit plan the cumulative non cash after tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial loss resulting from decline in discount rate investment loss and updated longevity market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these cumulative actuarial loss will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately nine year of december this amortization period is expected to extend approximately double in when our non union pension plan are completely frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participant instead of average future service during billion of these amount wa recognized component of postretirement benefit plan expense and about million is expected to be recognized expense in the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimate and judgment change of plus or minus basis point in the discount rate assumption at december with all other assumption held constant would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately billion which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholder equity at the end of the year of approximately billion if the discount rate at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension expense projected for would be lower or higher by approximately million each year difference between the actual plan asset return and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset impact the measurement of the following year fa expense every basis point difference in return during between our negative actual rate of return of approximately and our expected long term rate of return of impacted expected fa pension expense by approximately million funding considerationswe made contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in there were no material contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in and funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan is determined in manner consistent with ca and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa contribution to our defined benefit pension plan are recovered over time through the pricing of our product and service on government contract including fm and are recognized in our cost of sale and net sale ca govern the extent to which our pension cost are allocable to and recoverable under contract with the government including fm we recovered billion in billion in and billion in ca pension cost effective february and fully transitioned to in the ca rule were revised to better align the recovery of pension cost including prepayment credit on government contract with the minimum funding requirement of the ppa referred to ca harmonization pension cost recovery under ca occur in different period from when pension contribution are made under the ppa amount contributed in excess of the ca pension cost recovered under government contract are considered to be prepayment credit under the ca rule of december our prepayment credit were approximately billion compared to billion at december the increase wa due to our cash contribution of billion in compared to our billion in ca recovery cash contribution in excess of the recovery of ca pension cost under government contract increase the prepayment credit balance the prepayment credit balance will also increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan asset trendswe made contribution of billion to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in including required and discretionary contribution result of these contribution we do not expect to make contribution to our qualified defined benefit pension plan in we anticipate recovering approximately billion of ca pension cost in allowing to recuperate portion of our ca prepayment credit we expect our fa pension expense to be billion compared to our fa pension expense of billion the impact of the higher fa discount rate of for versus for wa partly offset by our negative actual rate of investment return in of approximately versus our expected long term rate of return of we expect fa ca of contentspension benefit in of about billion compared to billion in due to the lower fa pension expense and higher ca pension cost compared to environmental matterswe are party to various agreement proceeding and potential proceeding for environmental remediation issue including matter at various site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp at december and the total amount of liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matter wa million and million we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our product and service for agency of the government discussed below the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract ha been expensed through cost of sale we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we enter into agreement administrative consent order consent decree that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligation we also are involved in environmental remediation activity at site where formal agreement either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation environmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating the cost more judgmental due to for example changing remediation technology to determine the cost related to clean up site we have to ass the extent of contamination effect on natural resource the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standard we perform quarterly review of environmental remediation site and record liability and receivables in the period it becomes probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matter in note significant accounting policy and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency included in our note to consolidated financial statement we consider the above factor in our quarterly estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for environmental remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for particular environmental remediation site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined given the required level of judgment and estimation it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if different assumption were used or if circumstance were to change change in environmental standard or change in our estimate of the extent of contamination under agreement reached with the government most of the amount we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operation general and administrative cost under existing government regulation these and other environmental expenditure relating to our government business after deducting any recovery received from insurance or other prps are allowable in establishing price of our product and service result most of the expenditure we incur are included in our net sale and cost of sale according to government agreement or regulation regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and recent effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above california previously established maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of part per billion ppb this standard wa successfully challenged by the california manufacturer and technology association cmta for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis in response to the court ruling the state water resource control board state board branch of the california environmental protection agency withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulation leaving only the ppb standard for total chromium the state board ha indicated it will work to re establish hexavalent chromium standard if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re established at ppb or above it will not have material impact on our existing environmental remediation cost in california further the environmental protection agency epa is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium california is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate and the epa is taking step to regulate perchlorate in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period disclosed above we may record change in the amount of environmental remediation liability result of our quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site which would result in change to the corresponding environmental of contentsremediation receivables and charge to earnings for example if we were to determine that the liability should be increased by million the corresponding receivables would be increased by approximately million with the remainder recorded charge to earnings this allocation is determined annually based upon our existing and projected business activity with the government we can not reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation site with which we are involved there are number of former operating facility we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty assessing the extent of the contamination during any particular quarter such uncertainty may be resolved allowing to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate particular former operating site the amount of the liability could be material upon recognition of the liability portion will be recognized receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have material effect in any particular interim reporting period if we are ultimately found to have liability at those site where we have been designated prp we expect that the actual cost of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable prps generally prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible party are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among to share on an allocated basis the cost and expense for environmental investigation and remediation under existing environmental law responsible party are jointly and severally liable and therefore we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation the statutory framework provides that we may pursue right of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps the amount we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental cost we have incurred through insurance or from other prps which we are required to pursue by agreement and government regulation goodwillthe asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business our goodwill balance wa billion at december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use both qualitative and quantitative approach when testing goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least once every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year to perform the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent of contentsin future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of that test indicated that for each of our reporting unit including sikorsky no impairment existed of the date of our annual impairment test the carrying value of our sikorsky reporting unit includes goodwill of billion and exceeds it fair value by margin of approximately the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit is closely aligned therefore any business deterioration change in timing of order contract cancellation or termination or negative change in market factor could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to decline below current projection similarly market factor utilized in the impairment analysis including long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and transaction multiple could negatively impact the fair value of our reporting unit based on our assessment of these circumstance we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit is at risk for impairment should there be deterioration of projected cash flow negative change in market factor or significant increase in the carrying value of the reporting unit impairment assessment inherently involve management judgment regarding number of assumption such those described above due to the many variable inherent in the estimation of reporting unit fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill difference in assumption could have material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting unit and could result in goodwill impairment charge in future period intangible assetsintangible asset from acquired business are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program and are amortized on straight line basis over period of expected cash flow used to measure the fair value which range from nine to year acquired intangible deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from three to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired should event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of finite lived intangible may be impaired the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group carrying value should the asset group carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings the carrying value of our sikorsky business includes an indefinite lived trademark intangible asset of million of december in the fourth quarter of we performed the annual impairment test for the sikorsky indefinite lived trademark intangible asset and the result indicated that no impairment existed of the date of our annual impairment test the sikorsky trademark exceeded it carrying value by margin of approximately additionally our sikorsky business ha finite lived customer program intangible asset with carrying value of billion of december any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or negative change in market factor could cause our sale to decline below current projection based on our assessment of these circumstance we have determined that our sikorsky intangible asset are at risk for impairment should there be any business deterioration contract cancellation or termination or negative change in market factor recent accounting pronouncementssee note significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement under the caption recent accounting pronouncement of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe maintain active relationship with broad and diverse group of and international financial institution we believe that they provide with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business we continue to closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse development with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of and access to sufficient credit resource our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market price on certain equity security our financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt and commercial paper the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt wa billion at december and the outstanding principal amount wa billion excluding unamortized discount and issuance cost of billion change in the level of interest rate would not have material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december we use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the british pound sterling the euro the canadian dollar and the australian dollar these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to mitigate fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate result we do not have material foreign currency exposure including exposure to the pound sterling or euro should there be material foreign currency fluctuation due to the united kingdom departing from the european union commonly referred to brexit we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing indexed to libor in order to reduce the amount of interest paid these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to the effective portion of hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are attributable to the ineffective portion of the hedge or of derivative that are not considered to be highly effective hedge if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap at december and wa billion and billion the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge at december and wa billion and billion at december and the net fair value of our derivative instrument wa not material see note fair value measurement included in our note to consolidated financial statement unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contract would not have material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contract or our consolidated financial statement additionally we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transaction we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contract would be offset by movement on the underlying transaction and therefore when taken together do not create material risk we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transaction and only enter into agreement with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreement are executed our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across several bank we periodically monitor change to counterparty credit quality well our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose we maintain separate trust that includes investment to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plan of december investment in the trust totaled billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent asset the trust hold investment in marketable equity security and fixed income security that are exposed to price change and change in interest rate portion of the liability associated with the deferred compensation plan supported by the trust is also impacted by change in the market price of our common stock and certain market index change in the value of the liability have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of change in the value of the trust both the change in the fair value of

reclassified to conform with current year presentation the discussion and presentation of the operating result of our business segment have been impacted by the following recent event effective january we adopted accounting standard update asu revenue from contract with customer topic amended commonly referred to asc which changed the way we recognize revenue for certain contract and significantly expanded disclosure about revenue recognition in addition effective january we adopted asu compensation retirement benefit improving the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit cost which changed the statement of earnings presentation of certain component of pension and other postretirement benefit plan expense the amount for all period presented in this form have been adjusted to reflect these new method of accounting on august we completed the divestiture of the information system global solution is business which merged with subsidiary of leidos holding inc leidos in reverse morris trust transaction accordingly the operating result of the is business have been classified discontinued operation on our consolidated statement of earnings for all prior period presented however the cash flow of the is business have not been reclassified in our consolidated statement of cash flow we retained the cash part of the transaction see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the divestiture of the is business on august we increased our ownership interest in the awe management limited awe joint venture which operates the united kingdom nuclear deterrent program from to consequently we began consolidating awe and our operating result include of awe sale and of it operating profit prior to increasing our ownership interest we accounted for our investment in awe using the equity method of accounting under the equity method we recognized only of awe earnings or loss and no sale accordingly prior to august the date we obtained control we recorded of awe net earnings in our operating result and subsequent to august we recognized of awe sale and of it operating profit see note acquisition and divestiture for additional information about the change in ownership of awe use of estimate we prepare our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap in doing so we are required to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note we base these estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our actual result may differ materially from these estimate significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement include but are not limited to accounting for sale and cost recognition postretirement benefit plan environmental receivables and liability evaluation of goodwill and other asset for impairment income tax including deferred income tax fair value measurement and contingency revenue recognition the majority of our net sale are generated from long term contract with the government and international customer including foreign military sale fm contracted through the government for the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system product and service we provide our product and service under fixed price and cost reimbursable contract of contentsunder fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance the fixed fee in cost plus fixed fee contract is negotiated at the inception of the contract and that fixed fee doe not vary with actual cost we account for contract after it ha been approved by all party to the arrangement the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable we ass each contract at it inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contract when making this determination we consider factor such whether two or more contract were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective if combined we treat the combined contract single contract for revenue recognition purpose we evaluate the product or service promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for having one or more performance obligation the product and service in our contract are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationship and the significant contract management function required to perform under the contract accordingly our contract are typically accounted for one performance obligation in limited case our contract have more than one distinct performance obligation which occurs when we perform activity that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles significant judgment is required in determining performance obligation and these decision could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the performance obligation we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the product or service being provided under the contract for contract where portion of the price may vary we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk at the inception of contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current right and do not contemplate future modification including unexercised option or follow on contract until they become legally enforceable contract are often subsequently modified to include change in specification requirement or price which may create new or change existing enforceable right and obligation depending on the nature of the modification we consider whether to account for the modification an adjustment to the existing contract or separate contract generally modification to our contract are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated task provided in the context of the contract therefore such modification are accounted for if they were part of the existing contract and recognized cumulative adjustment to revenue for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to customer on standalone basis not bundled with any other product or service our contract with the government including fm contract are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual cost plus reasonable profit margin result of these regulation the standalone selling price of product or service in our contract with the government and fm contract are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract for non government contract with multiple performance obligation we evaluate whether the stated selling price for the product or service represent their standalone selling price we primarily sell customized solution unique to customer specification when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligation we typically use the expected cost plus reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service we occasionally of contentssell standard product or service with observable standalone sale transaction in these situation the observable standalone sale transaction are used to determine the standalone selling price we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service in determining when performance obligation are satisfied we consider factor such contract term payment term and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfer continuously to the customer for contract with the government and fm contract this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit and take possession of any work in process our non government contract primarily international direct commercial contract typically do not include termination for convenience provision however continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reason other than our non performance we would have the right to recover damage which would include among other potential damage the right to payment for our work performed to date plus reasonable profit to deliver product or service that do not have an alternative use to for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the performance obligation for performance obligation to provide service to the customer revenue is recognized over time based on cost incurred or the right to invoice method in situation where the value transferred match our billing right our customer receives and consumes the benefit for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point backlog unfulfilled or remaining performance obligation represents the sale we expect to recognize for our product and service for which control ha not yet transferred to the customer for our cost reimbursable and fixed priced incentive contract the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the term of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount the estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period in determining the estimated consideration we consider the risk related to the technical schedule and cost impact to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration periodically we review these risk and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly the risk on such contract are successfully retired the estimated consideration from customer may be reduced resulting in reduction of backlog without corresponding recognition of sale of december our ending backlog wa billion we expect to recognize approximately of our backlog over the next month and approximately over the next month revenue with the remainder recognized thereafter for arrangement with the government and fm contract we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type typical payment term under fixed price contract with the government provide that the customer pay either performance based payment pbps based on the achievement of contract milestone or progress payment based on percentage of cost we incur for the majority of our international direct commercial contract to deliver complex system we typically receive advance payment prior to commencement of work well milestone payment that are paid in accordance with the term of our contract we perform we recognize liability for payment in excess of revenue recognized which is presented contract liability on the balance sheet the portion of payment retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligation under the contract payment received from customer in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demand that can be higher in the early stage of contract for fixed price and cost reimbursable contract we present revenue recognized in excess of billing contract asset on the balance sheet amount billed and due from our customer under both contract type are classified receivables on the balance sheet significant estimate and assumption are made in estimating contract sale and cost including the profit booking rate at the outset of long term contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract well variable consideration and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of sale and total cost to of contentscomplete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead general and administrative and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset or localization agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase or our estimate of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to risk retirement usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring charge insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset our consolidated net adjustment not related to volume including net profit booking rate adjustment and other item increased segment operating profit by approximately billion billion and billion in and these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately billion per share billion per share and million per share in and we recognized net sale from performance obligation satisfied in prior period of approximately billion billion and billion in and which primarily relate to change in profit booking rate that impacted revenue previously disclosed we have program eadge to design integrate and install an air missile defense command control communication computer intelligence system for an international customer that ha experienced performance matter and for which we have periodically accrued reserve in we revised our estimated cost to complete the eadge contract consequence of ongoing performance matter and recorded an additional charge of million million or per share after tax at our rotary and mission system rms business segment which resulted in cumulative loss of approximately million on this program of december cumulative loss remained at approximately million we continue to monitor program requirement and our performance at this time we do not anticipate additional charge that would be material to our operating result or financial condition we have two commercial satellite program for the delivery of three satellite in total to international customer at our space business segment for which we have experienced performance issue related to the development and integration of modernized lm satellite platform these program require the development of new satellite technology to enhance the lm power propulsion and electronics among other item the enhanced lm satellite platform is expected to benefit other commercial and government satellite program we have periodically revised our estimated cost to complete these developmental commercial program we have recorded cumulative loss of approximately million through december in we recorded loss of approximately million million or per share after tax while these loss reflect our estimated total loss on the program we will continue to incur general and administrative cost each period until we complete these program these program remain developmental and further challenge in the delivery and integration of new satellite technology anomaly discovered during system testing requiring repair or rework further schedule delay and potential penalty could require that we record additional loss reserve which could be material to our operating result we previously disclosed that we did not meet the july delivery requirement for two satellite the customer could seek to exercise termination right one of the satellite ha now been launched eliminating this risk the other is expected to launch in the first half of we believe it unlikely that the customer will seek to do so were the customer to seek to exercise termination right and be successful in this effort we would have to refund the payment we have received and pay certain penalty on the third satellite we currently anticipate delivery before the date upon which the customer could seek to exercise termination right although we may have to pay certain penalty and have sought to address this possibility in our reserve of contentswe are responsible for designing developing and installing an upgraded turret for the warrior capability sustainment program in we revised our estimated cost to complete the program consequence of performance issue and recorded charge of approximately million million or per share after tax at our missile and fire control mfc business segment which resulted in cumulative loss of approximately million on this program of december we may continue to experience issue related to customer requirement and our performance under this contract and have to record additional charge however based on the loss already recorded and our current estimate of the sale and cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional loss if any would be material to our operating result or financial condition research and development and similar cost we conduct research and development activity using our own fund referred to company funded or independent research and development ir and under contractual arrangement with our customer referred to customer funded to enhance existing product and service and to develop future technology cost include basic research applied research concept formulation study design development and related test activity company funded cost are allocated to customer contract part of the general and administrative overhead cost and generally recoverable on our customer contract with the government customer funded cost are charged directly to the related customer contract substantially all cost are charged to cost of sale incurred company funded cost charged to cost of sale totaled billion in billion in and million in stock based compensation compensation cost related to all share based payment is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award we generally recognize the compensation cost ratably over three year vesting period net of estimated forfeiture at each reporting date the number of share is adjusted to the number ultimately expected to vest income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of asset and liability and their respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid we periodically ass our tax exposure related to period that are open to examination based on the latest available information we evaluate our tax position to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authority if we can not reach more likely than not determination no benefit is recorded if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled we record interest and penalty related to income tax component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings interest and penalty were not material cash and cash equivalent cash equivalent include highly liquid instrument with original maturity of day or le receivables receivables net represent our unconditional right to consideration under the contract and include amount billed and currently due from customer the amount are stated at their net estimated realizable value there were no significant impairment loss related to our receivables in or on occasion our customer may seek deferred payment term to purchase our product in connection with these transaction we may at our customer request enter into arrangement for the non recourse sale of customer receivables to unrelated third party financial institution for accounting purpose these transaction are not discounted and are treated sale of receivables we have no continuing involvement the sale proceeds from the financial institution are reflected in our operating cash flow on the statement of cash flow we sold approximately million in and million in of customer receivables there were no gain or loss related to sale of these receivables contract asset contract asset include unbilled amount typically resulting from sale under contract when the percentage of completion cost to cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer the amount may not exceed their estimated net realizable value contract asset are classified current based on our contract operating cycle inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value if event or change in circumstance indicate that the utility of our inventory have diminished through damage deterioration obsolescence change in price or other cause loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs we capitalize labor material subcontractor and overhead cost work in process for contract where control ha not yet passed to the customer in addition we capitalize cost incurred to fulfill contract in advance of contract award in inventory work in process if we determine that contract award is probable we determine the cost of other product and supply inventory by using the first in first out or average cost method of contentscontract liability contract liability formerly referred to customer advance and amount in excess of cost incurred include advance payment and billing in excess of revenue recognized contract liability are classified current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on contract by contract basis net of revenue recognized at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment we record property plant and equipment at cost we provide for depreciation and amortization on plant and equipment generally using accelerated method during the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset and the straight line method thereafter the estimated useful life of our plant and equipment generally range from to year for building and five to year for machinery and equipment no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation depreciation expense related to plant and equipment wa million in million in and million in we review the carrying amount of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset grouping to it carrying amount if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying amount capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to six year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million net of accumulated amortization of billion and billion no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in goodwill the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business our goodwill balance wa billion at both december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use either qualitative or quantitative approach when testing reporting unit goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least once every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year for the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of certain asset and liability held at the business segment and corporate level of contentsduring the fourth quarter of and we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed intangible asset intangible asset from acquired business are recognized at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program and are amortized on straight line basis over period of expected cash flow used to measure the fair value which range from nine to year acquired intangible deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from three to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired postretirement benefit plan many of our employee are covered by defined benefit pension plan and we provide certain health care and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree collectively postretirement benefit plan gaap requires that the amount we record related to our postretirement benefit plan be computed based on service to date using actuarial valuation that are based in part on certain key economic assumption we make including the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality health care cost trend rate and employee turnover each appropriate based on the nature of the plan market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these asset gain or loss along with those resulting from adjustment to our benefit obligation will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over the average future service period of employee expected to receive benefit under the plan of approximately nine year of december this amortization period is expected to extend approximately double in when our non union pension plan is frozen to use the average remaining life expectancy of the participant instead of average future service we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset recorded within other noncurrent asset or liability recorded within noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended by the pension protection act of ppa is calculated on different basis than under gaap environmental matter we record liability for environmental matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined our environmental liability are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other liability both current and noncurrent we expect to include substantial portion of environmental cost in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government agreement or regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continuously evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and recent effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established our environmental receivables are recorded on our consolidated

the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet significant influence typically exists if we have to ownership interest in the investee under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in operating profit in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we

which are intended to mitigate certain economic exposure we record derivative at their fair value the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to the effective portion of hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings

of comprehensive principle for recognizing revenue under gaap among other thing asc requires entity to ass the product or service promised in contract with customer at contract inception to determine the appropriate unit at which to record revenue which is referred to performance obligation revenue is recognized when control of the promised product or service is transferred to customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in of contentsexchange for those product or service prior to the adoption of asc we recognized the majority of our revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the nature of product provided or service performed revenue wa recorded cost were incurred the percentage of completion cost to cost method or unit were delivered the percentage of completion unit of delivery method for most of our contract the customer obtains control or receives benefit we perform on the contract result under asc revenue is recognized over time utilizing the percentage of completion cost to cost method this change generally result in an acceleration of revenue for contract that were historically accounted for using the percentage of completion unit of delivery method revenue are now recognized earlier in the performance period we incur cost for more information on our policy for recognizing revenue under asc see note significant accounting policy significant program impacted by these change include the and program in our aeronautics business segment tactical missile program hellfire and

the adoption of asu increased our aocl at january by billion with corresponding increase to retained earnings by the same amount with zero impact to total equity the reclassification wa primarily related to the impact of tax reform on deferred tax asset associated with net actuarial loss and prior service credit resulting from our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan that were originally recorded in aocl within equity those amount were originally recorded net of deferred tax benefit based on the federal statutory income tax rate in effect at the time they were recorded gaap requires entity to remeasure deferred tax asset and liability result of change in tax law or rate with the impact reflected in earnings accordingly in the fourth quarter of we remeasured the deferred tax asset associated with our aocl using the lower corporate income tax rate under the tax act with the impact of the remeasurement recorded one time charge to earnings prior to asu gaap required the original deferred tax amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss to remain at the old tax rate despite the fact that it related deferred tax asset or liability wa remeasured result of the tax act asu allows entity to record one time reclassification of these tax effect between accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and retained earnings we reclassify

the subsidiary of lockheed martin that performed information technology service for msa well current and former employee of each of these entity the investigation relate primarily to information technology service performed by subsidiary of lockheed martin under subcontract to msa doj recently stated that they are preparing to file complaint alleging civil false claim act violation we can not reasonably estimate our exposure at this time but it is possible that settlement or judgment against any of the party being investigated could implicate lockheed martin indemnification obligation described above at present in view of what we believe to be the strength of the defense leidos assumption of the liability and structure of the indemnity we do not believe it probable that we will incur material loss environmental matterswe are involved in proceeding and potential proceeding relating to soil sediment surface water and groundwater contamination disposal of hazardous waste and other environmental matter at several of our current or former facility and at third party site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp substantial portion of environmental of contentscosts will be included in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record receivable for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our environmental receivables by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established at december and the aggregate amount of liability recorded relative to environmental matter wa million and million most of which are recorded in other noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet we have recorded receivables totaling million and million at december and most of which are recorded in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet for the estimated future recovery of these cost we consider the recovery probable based on the factor previously mentioned we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year environmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination well such factor changing remediation technology and changing regulatory environmental standard there are number of former and present operating facility that we are monitoring or investigating for potential future remediation we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables additionally in our quarterly review we consider these and other factor in estimating the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity and record liability when it is probable that loss ha occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we reasonably can not determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case although loss may be probable or reasonably possible in some case it is not possible at this time to estimate the loss or reasonably possible loss or range of loss we also pursue claim for recovery of cost incurred or for contribution to site cleanup cost against other prps including the government and are conducting remediation activity under various consent decree order and agreement relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at certain site of former or current operation under agreement related to certain site in california and new york the government reimburses an amount equal to percentage specific to each site of expenditure for certain remediation activity in the government capacity prp under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla in addition to the proceeding and potential proceeding discussed above california previously established maximum level of the contaminant hexavalent chromium in drinking water of part per billion ppb this standard wa successfully challenged by the california manufacturer and technology association cmta for failure to conduct the required economic feasibility analysis in response to the court ruling the state water resource control board state board branch of the california environmental protection agency withdrew the hexavalent chromium standard from the published regulation leaving only the ppb standard for total chromium the state board ha indicated it will work to re establish hexavalent chromium standard if the standard for hexavalent chromium is re established at ppb or above it will not have material impact on our existing environmental remediation cost in california further the environmental protection agency epa is considering whether to regulate hexavalent chromium california is also reevaluating it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate and the epa is taking step to regulate perchlorate in drinking water if substantially lower standard are adopted in either california or at the federal level for perchlorate or for hexavalent chromium we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on
