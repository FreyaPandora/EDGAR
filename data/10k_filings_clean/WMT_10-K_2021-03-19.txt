ecommerce sale for particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year the retail industry generally report comparable sale using the retail calendar also known the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sale using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings release however when we discus our comparable sale below we are referring to our

fuel for fiscal and were follows fiscal year ended january with fuelfuel impactwalmart sam total comparable sale in the including fuel increased and in fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year walmart comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively for fiscal comparable sale growth wa driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from increased demand

ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively we continue to focus on seamless omni channel experience for our customer sam club comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively for fiscal sam club comparable sale benefited from growth in transaction and average ticket resulting from the covid pandemic partially offset by both our decision to remove tobacco from certain club location and by lower fuel sale sam club comparable sale for fiscal benefited from growth in transaction and higher fuel sale which were partially offset by lower average ticket due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain club location sam club ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively consistent operating disciplinewe operate with discipline by managing expense optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvement to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce cost we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define net sale growing at faster rate than operating selling general and administrative operating expense fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale percentage change from comparable operating selling general and administrative expense percentage change from comparable operating selling general and administrative expense percentage of net for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale wa flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expense percentage of net sale benefited from strong growth in comparable sale and lapping the billion business restructuring charge from the prior year described below these benefit were offset by billion of incremental cost related to the covid pandemic and billion business restructuring charge in the walmart segment recorded in the second

comparable store sale these improvement were partially offset by billion in business restructuring charge consisting primarily of non cash impairment charge for certain trade name acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charge due to strategic decision that resulted in the write of certain asset in the walmart and walmart international segment capital allocationour strategy includes improving our customer facing initiative in store and club and creating seamless omni channel experience for our customer such we are allocating more capital to ecommerce technology supply chain and store remodels and le to new store and club opening total fiscal capital expenditure decreased slightly compared to the prior year the following table provides additional detail amount in million fiscal year ended january allocation of capital technology supply chain and other new store and club including expansion and total walmart total capital expenditure returnsas we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on asset return on investment and free cash flow metric we also provide return in the form of share repurchase and dividend which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resource section return on asset and return on investment we include return on asset roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statement presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the gaap and return on investment roi metric to ass return on asset while roi is considered non gaap financial measure management belief roi is meaningful metric to share with investor because it help investor ass how effectively walmart is deploying it asset trend in roi can fluctuate over time management balance long term strategic initiative with possible short term impact roa wa and for fiscal and respectively the decrease in roa wa primarily due to the loss on certain international operation held for sale or sold partially offset by the fair value change in our equity investment well the increase in operating income roi wa and for fiscal and respectively the increase in roi wa primarily due to the increase in operating income we define roi adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing twelve month divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total asset plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization le average account payable and average accrued liability for that period for fiscal lease related asset and associated accumulated amortization are included in the denominator at their carrying amount of that balance sheet date rather than averaged because they are not directly comparable to the prior year calculation which included rent for the trailing month multiplied by factor of two point average wa used for leased asset beginning in fiscal after one full year from the date of adoption of asu lease topic asu our calculation of roi is considered non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measure that exclude and include amount that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total asset for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense item and add interest income adjusts total asset for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization account payable and accrued liability to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustment mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measure how we are deploying our key asset and is more meaningful to investor than roa although roi is standard financial measure numerous method exist for calculating company roi result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their roi calculation of roa and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is follows fiscal year ended january amount in million of return on assetsnumeratorconsolidated net income denominatoraverage total asset return on asset roa calculation of return on investmentnumeratoroperating income interest depreciation and roi operating income denominatoraverage total asset average accumulated depreciation and amortization average account payable average accrued liability average invested capital return on investment roi of january balance sheet data total asset leased asset total asset without leased asset accumulated depreciation and accumulated amortization on leased accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased account accrued the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the corresponding prior period and dividing by average total asset used in roa includes the average impact of the adoption of asu for fiscal result of adopting asu average total asset is based on the average of total asset without leased asset net plus leased asset net of january average accumulated depreciation and amortization is based on the average of accumulated depreciation and amortization without leased asset plus accumulated amortization on leased asset of january np not provided free cash flowfree cash flow is considered non gaap financial measure management belief however that free cash flow which measure our ability to generate additional cash from our business operation is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than substitute for consolidated net income measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activity measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resource for discussion of gaap metric including net cash provided by operating activity net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity we define free cash flow net cash provided by operating activity in period minus payment for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activity of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively we generated free cash flow of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal increased when compared to fiscal primarily due to the impact of the global health crisis which accelerated inventory sell through well the timing and payment of inventory purchase incremental covid related expense and certain benefit payment free cash flow for fiscal increased when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the increase in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in decreased capital expenditure net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal wa primarily due to the contribution to the asda pension plan in anticipation of it settlement the inclusion of full year of flipkart operation and the timing of vendor payment free cash flow for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the decline in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in increased capital expenditure walmart definition of free cash flow is limited in that it doe not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditure due to the fact that the measure doe not deduct the payment required for debt service and other contractual obligation or payment made for business acquisition therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statement of cash flow although other company report their free cash flow numerous method may exist for calculating company free cash flow result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their free cash flow the following table set forth reconciliation of free cash flow non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activity which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow well information regarding net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity fiscal year ended january amount in million cash provided by operating activity payment for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activity net cash used in financing activity net cash used in investing activity includes payment for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow result of operationsconsolidated result of operationsfiscal year ended january amount in million

increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year these increase in revenue were due to increase in net sale which increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase wa primarily due to strong positive comparable sale for the walmart and sam club segment well positive comparable sale in the majority of our international market resulting from increased demand stemming from the covid pandemic overall net sale growth wa strong despite certain operating limitation in several international market in the second quarter of fiscal due to government regulation and precautionary measure taken result of the covid pandemic the net sale increase wa partially offset by negative fluctuation in currency exchange rate of billion for fiscal net sale were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sale for walmart and sam club segment along with the addition of net sale from flipkart which we acquired in august and positive comparable sale in the majority of our international market these increase were partially offset by billion of negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate in fiscal and our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august our gross profit rate increased basis point and decreased basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase wa primarily due to strategic sourcing initiative strong sale in higher margin category and fewer markdowns this wa partially offset in the walmart segment by carryover of prior year price investment well the temporary closure of our auto care center and vision center in response to the pandemic for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to price investment in the walmart segment and the addition of flipkart in the walmart international segment partially offset by favorable merchandise mix including strength in private brand and le pressure from transportation cost in the walmart segment for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale wa flat when compared to the previous fiscal year operating expense percentage of net sale benefited from strong growth in comparable sale and lapping the billion business restructuring charge from the prior year described below these benefit were offset by billion of incremental cost related to the covid pandemic and billion business restructuring charge in the walmart segment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year due to our focus on expense management combined with our growth in comparable store sale these improvement were partially offset by billion in business restructuring charge consisting primarily of non cash impairment charge for certain trade name acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charge due to strategic decision that resulted in the write down of certain asset in the walmart and walmart international segment other gain and loss consisted of net gain of billion and billion for fiscal and respectively the gain in fiscal primarily reflects billion in net gain associated with the fair value change of our equity investment partially offset by the billion pre tax loss related to the divestiture of certain international operation classified held for sale or sold in fiscal the gain in fiscal wa primarily the result of billion increase in the market value of our investment in jd com our effective income tax rate wa for fiscal for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the loss related to the divestiture of certain international operation classified held for or sold in fiscal which provided minimal realizable tax benefit the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal compared to fiscal wa primarily due to the fiscal loss on sale of majority stake in walmart brazil which increased the previous comparative fiscal year effective tax rate it provided minimal realizable tax benefit our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate result of various factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix and size of earnings among our operation and international operation which are subject to statutory rate that beginning in fiscal are generally higher than the statutory rate the reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective income tax rate for fiscal and is presented in note result of the factor discussed above we reported billion and billion of consolidated net income for fiscal and respectively which represents decrease of billion and an increase of billion for fiscal and respectively when compared to the

sale percentage change from comparable calendar comparable sale operating income operating income percentage of net unit count at period retail square foot at period net sale for the walmart segment increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase in net sale were primarily due to increase in comparable sale of and for fiscal and respectively comparable sale in fiscal were driven by growth in average ticket primarily resulting from meeting the increased demand due to economic condition related to the covid pandemic while transaction decreased customer consolidated shopping trip comparable sale in fiscal were driven by both average ticket and transaction growth for fiscal walmart ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively we continue to focus on seamless omni channel experience for our customer gross profit rate wa flat and decreased basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year while fiscal gross profit rate wa flat it benefited from strategic sourcing initiative and fewer markdowns offset by change in merchandise mix the carryover effect of prior year price investment and the temporary closure of our auto care and vision center in response to the covid pandemic for fiscal the decrease wa primarily the result of continued price investment which were partially offset by better merchandise mix including strength in private brand and le pressure from transportation cost expense percentage of segment net sale decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year we leveraged operating expense in fiscal primarily result of strong sale which were partially offset by billion of incremental cost related to the covid pandemic including special bonus expanded sick and emergency leave pay cost associated with outfitting our store and associate with mask glove and sanitizer and expanded cleaning practice fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale wa also slightly aided by lapping the billion business restructuring charge from the prior year described below offset by billion business restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of fiscal resulting from change to walmart support team to better support it omni channel strategy the decrease in fiscal wa primarily due to strong sale and productivity improvement which were mostly offset by business restructuring charge of billion consisting primarily of non cash impairment charge for certain trade name acquired developed technology and other business restructuring charge due to decision that resulted in the write down of certain ecommerce asset result of the factor discussed above segment operating income increased billion and decreased million for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year walmart international segment fiscal year ended january

comparable sale growth in the majority of our market driven by change in consumer behavior in response to the covid pandemic partially offset by negative fluctuation in currency exchange rate of billion the pandemic led to significant economic pressure and channel and mix shift due to change in consumer behavior including accelerated growth in ecommerce in several market while several of our market experienced extensive store and operational closure in the second quarter result of government mandate most closed store and warehouse had resumed operation by the third quarter for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to negative fluctuation in currency exchange rate of billion well reduction in sale due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in august offset by full year of net sale from flipkart and positive comparable sale growth in the majority of our market gross profit rate increased basis point and decreased basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase wa primarily due to flipkart improved margin mix and reduced fuel sale in the for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to flipkart well change in merchandise mix operating expense percentage of segment net sale increased basis point and decreased basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year the increase in operating expense percentage of segment net sale for fiscal wa primarily due to billion of incremental cost related to the covid pandemic partially offset by positive comparable sale in the majority of our market and lapping the impairment charge in the prior year discussed below fiscal decreased primarily due to positive comparable sale in the majority of our market well cost discipline across multiple market partially offset by billion in impairment charge primarily due to the write off of the carrying value of one of flipkart two fashion trade name jabong com result of strategic decision to focus our effort on single fashion platform in order to simplify the business and customer proposition result of the factor discussed above segment operating income increased billion and decreased

result of operation which are impacted by the volatility of fuel price volatility in fuel price may continue to impact the operating result of the sam club segment in the future management us such information to better measure underlying operating result in the segment net sale for the sam club segment increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous

percentage of segment net sale increased and decreased basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year despite increased net sale from the strong demand resulting from the covid pandemic fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale increased primarily due to billion of incremental cost related to the pandemic which included additional cost such special bonus expanded cleaning practice and security expanded sick and emergency leave pay and outfitting our associate with mask and glove additionally the increase in operating expense percentage of segment net sale wa affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sale for fiscal the decrease wa primarily the result of lower labor related cost and charge of approximately million related to lease exit cost in the

the general economic environment condition in the retail industry our financial position including our total debt and capitalization and change in our business strategy any downgrade of our credit rating by credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing cost or impair our ability to access capital and credit market on term commercially acceptable to in addition any downgrade of our

sub caption legal proceeding in note to our consolidated financial statement we also discus various legal proceeding related to the asda equal value claim and opioids litigation in item legal proceeding herein under the caption supplemental information the foregoing matter and other matter described elsewhere in this annual report on form represent contingency of the company that may or may not result in the company incurring material liability upon their final resolution summary of critical accounting estimatesmanagement strives to report our financial result in clear and understandable manner although in some case accounting and disclosure rule are complex and require to use technical terminology in preparing the company consolidated financial statement we follow accounting principle generally accepted in the these principle require to make certain estimate and apply judgment that affect our financial position and result of operation reflected in our financial statement these judgment and estimate are based on past event and expectation of future outcome actual result may differ from our estimate management continually review our accounting policy how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statement following is summary of our critical accounting estimate and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statement inventorieswe value inventory at the lower of cost or market determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for walmart segment inventory the inventory at the sam club segment is valued using the weighted average cost lifo method when necessary we record lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimate are adjusted to actual result determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory level markup rate and internally generated retail price index measure of sensitivity increase to our retail price index would not have resulted in decrease to the carrying value of inventory of january and our inventory valued at lifo approximated those inventory if they were valued at first in first out fifo impairment of assetswe evaluate long lived asset for indicator of impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable management judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator are based on market condition and financial performance the evaluation of long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factor depends on number of condition including uncertainty about future event and change in demographic thus our accounting estimate may change from period to period these factor could cause management to conclude that indicator of impairment exist and require impairment test be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived asset is impaired resulting in write down of the related long lived asset impairment charge on asset held and used were immaterial in fiscal and measure of sensitivity fiscal impairment would not change materially with decrease in the undiscounted cash flow for the store or club with indicator of impairment in fiscal the company operation in argentina japan and the united kingdom met the held for sale criterion result the individual disposal group were measured at fair value le cost to sell which resulted in impairment charge that were included in the total estimated pre tax loss of billion recorded in fiscal refer to note fiscal included pre tax loss of billion related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil which included full impairment of all related asset business combination goodwill and acquired intangible assetswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that once control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest are recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of identifiable asset and liability requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset acquired in business combination we typically use the income method significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flow growth rate discount rate and useful life the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition component within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed single reporting unit if the component have similar economic characteristic of january our reporting unit consisted of walmart walmart international and sam club goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible asset are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the value of certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begin with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factor that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not le than the carrying amount or that fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgment relating to future cash flow growth rate and economic and market condition these evaluation are based on determining the fair value of reporting unit or asset using valuation method such discounted cash flow or relative market based approach historically our reporting unit have generated sufficient return to recover the cost of goodwill the fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value our indefinite lived acquired intangible asset have also historically generated sufficient return to recover their cost because of the nature of the factor used in these test if different condition occur in future period future operating result could be materially impacted due to certain strategic restructuring decision we recorded approximately billion in impairment in fiscal related to acquired trade name and acquired developed software contingencieswe are involved in number of legal proceeding we record liability when it is probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingency where loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that loss could be incurred in excess of amount accrued if loss or an additional loss ha at least reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statement would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnote to our financial statement we review all contingency at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss ha changed and to ass whether reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate range of possible loss in certain matter described in note to our consolidated financial statement and have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matter an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business financial position result of operation or cash flow income taxesincome tax have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction accordingly the determination of our provision for income tax requires judgment the use of estimate in certain case and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our effective income tax rate is affected by many factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency increase and decrease in valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix of earnings among our and international operation where the statutory rate are generally higher than the statutory rate and may fluctuate result our tax return are routinely audited and settlement of issue raised in these audit sometimes affect our tax provision the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from taxing authority when fact and circumstance change we reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate we account for uncertain tax position by determining the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statement this determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset are evaluated for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factor are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectation of future taxable income carryforward period and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factor the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy this evaluation relies on estimate on december the tax act wa enacted and contains significant change to income tax law effective beginning january the tax act reduced the statutory tax rate from to and created new tax on foreign sourced earnings and related party payment discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement we completed our accounting for the tax effect of the tax act in fiscal further guidance is issued by the treasury department the irs and other standard setting body any resulting change to our estimate will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket riskin addition to the risk inherent in our operation we are exposed to certain market risk including change in interest rate currency exchange rate and the fair value of certain equity investment the analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instrument is based on hypothetical scenario used to calibrate potential risk and doe not represent our view of future market change the effect of change in particular assumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption in reality however change in one factor could cause change in another which may magnify or negate other sensitivity interest rate riskwe are exposed to change in interest rate result of our short term borrowing and long term debt we hedge portion of our interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swap for fiscal the net fair value of our interest rate swap increased million primarily due to fluctuation in market interest rate the table below provides information about our financial instrument that are sensitive to change in interest rate for long term debt the table represents the principal cash flow and related weighted average interest rate by expected maturity date for interest rate swap the table represents the contractual cash flow and weighted average interest rate by the contractual maturity date unless otherwise noted the notional amount are used to calculate contractual cash flow to be exchanged under the contract the weighted average variable rate are based upon prevailing market rate of january expected maturity date amount in million fiscal term borrowing variable rate weighted average interest long term debt fixed rate weighted average interest variable rate weighted average interest interest rate derivativesinterest rate swap fixed to variable weighted average pay rate weighted average receive rate includes deferred loan cost discount fair value hedge foreign held debt and secured debt of january our variable rate borrowing including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swap represented of our total short term and long term debt based on january debt level basis point change in prevailing market rate would cause our annual interest cost to change by approximately million foreign currency riskwe are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate result of our net investment and operation in country other than the well our foreign currency denominated long term debt for fiscal movement in currency exchange rate and the related impact on the translation of the balance sheet resulted in the billion net gain in the currency translation and other category of accumulated other comprehensive loss we hedge portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swap the aggregate fair value of these swap wa in liability position of million and million of january and january respectively the change in the fair value of these swap wa due to fluctuation in currency exchange rate primarily due to the strengthening of certain currency relative to the dollar in fiscal the hypothetical result of uniform weakening in the value of the dollar relative to other currency underlying these swap would have resulted in change in the value of the swap of million hypothetical change in interest rate underlying
