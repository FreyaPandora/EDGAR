our business the following factor should be considered in addition to the other information in this annual report on form before you buy our common stock you should know that making such an investment involves risk including but not limited to the risk described below any one of the following risk could harm our business financial condition result of operation or reputation which could cause our stock price to decline and you may lose all or part of investment additional risk trend and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business financial condition result of operation or reputation risk related to our industry and marketsif we fail to meet the evolving need of our market or to identify new product service or technology our revenue and financial result may be adversely impacted our gpu based visual and accelerated computing platform address four large market gaming professional visualization data center and automotive these market often experience rapid technological change change in customer requirement new product introduction and enhancement and evolving industry standard our success depends on our ability to identify emerging industry change and to develop new or enhance our existing product service and technology that meet the evolving need of these market such activity may require considerable technical financial compliance sale and marketing investment we devote significant resource to the development of technology and business offering in market where we have limited operating history such the automotive and data center market which present additional risk to our business for example we must continue to accurately forecast demand scale and optimize utilization in our data center business and develop and deliver next generation autonomous driving solution to our partner and customer or our business could be negatively impacted we also must continue to scale our networking business following the mellanox acquisition by leveraging our joint product capability and continuing to effectively integrate company process we must also continue to develop the infrastructure needed to scale our business in these area including customer service and support commerce and intellectual property or ip licensing capability if we do not continue to evolve our business including by developing of contentsmarket specific technology managing the social and environmental impact of our product and technology expanding the ecosystem for our current and future product and technology and monetizing and expanding our business in various area our financial result could be negatively impacted we also must meet customer safety and compliance standard which are subject to change including those applicable to our automotive solution and system additionally we continue to make considerable investment in research and development which may not produce significant revenue for several year if at all if our investment are unsuccessful and we fail to develop new product service and technology or if we focus on technology that do not become widely adopted our business revenue financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected we can not assure you that our strategic direction will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer partner and ultimately our shareholder if we fail to anticipate the changing need of our target market and emerging technology trend or if we do not appropriately adapt our strategy market condition evolve in timely manner to exploit potential market opportunity our business will be harmed for our product that we do not sell directly to consumer achieving design win is an important success factor including for our interconnect product achieving design win may involve lengthy process in pursuit of customer opportunity and depend on our ability to anticipate feature and functionality that customer and consumer will demand failure to obtain particular design win may prevent from obtaining design win in subsequent generation of particular product this could result in lost revenue and could weaken our position in future competitive bid selection process unanticipated change in industry standard could render our product incompatible with product developed by major hardware manufacturer and software developer additionally if our product are not in compliance with prevailing industry standard including safety standard our customer may not incorporate our product into their design strategy furthermore winning product design doe not guarantee sale to customer or that we will realize much revenue anticipated if any competition in our current and target market could prevent from growing our revenue our target market remain extremely competitive and we expect competition to intensify current competitor expand their product and or service offering industry standard continue to evolve customer need change and new competitor enter these market our competitor product service and technology may be le costly or may offer superior functionality or better feature than ours which may result among other thing in lower than expected selling price for our product in addition some of our competitor operate and maintain their own fabrication facility have longer operating history larger customer base more comprehensive ip portfolio and patent protection and greater financial sale marketing and distribution resource than we do these competitor may be able to more effectively identify and capitalize upon opportunity in new market and end user customer trend quickly transition their product including semiconductor product to increasingly smaller line width geometry and obtain sufficient foundry capacity and packaging material which could harm our business in our networking business some of our customer are also integrated circuit and switch supplier and already have in house expertise and internal development capability similar to ours licensing our technology and supporting such customer entail the transfer of intellectual property right that may enable such customer to develop their own product and solution to replace those we are currently providing to them consequently these customer may become competitor to further each new design by customer present competitive situation if we are unable to successfully compete in our target market respond to change in our target market or introduce new offering to meet the need of this competitive environment including in significant international market such china demand for our product service and technology could decrease which would cause our revenue to decline and cause our result of operation to suffer in addition the competitive landscape in our target market ha changed and may continue to evolve due to trend toward consolidation which could lead to fewer customer partner or supplier any of which could negatively affect our financial result risk related to our supply and manufacturingwe depend on third party and their technology to manufacture assemble test and or package our product which reduces our control over product quantity and quality manufacturing yield development enhancement and product delivery schedule and could harm our business we do not manufacture the silicon wafer used for our product and do not own or operate wafer fabrication facility instead we are dependent on industry leading foundry such taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company limited and samsung electronics co ltd to manufacture our semiconductor wafer using their fabrication equipment and technique similarly we do not directly assemble test or package our product but instead rely on independent subcontractor in the past we have not had and going forward we may not have long term commitment contract with these foundry or subcontractor nevertheless we may enter into long term procurement and capacity commitment of contentsas our business grows or in period with limited availability of capacity and component in our supply chain our business grows we must continue to scale and adapt our supply chain or it could have an adverse impact on our business result we face several significant risk which could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand scale our supply chain and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result including lack of guaranteed supply of wafer and other component and potential higher wafer and component price which could be impacted by our failure to correctly estimate demand and to place order with our supplier in sufficient quantity and or in timely manner failure by our foundry to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate or any manufacturing or test capacity for our product failure by our foundry to develop obtain or successfully implement high quality leading edge process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology such advanced process node technology and memory design needed to manufacture our product profitably or on timely basis limited number of supplier including foundry assembly and test provider and memory manufacturer loss of supplier and additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new foundry or subcontractor and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier lack of direct control over delivery schedule or product quantity and quality and delay in product shipment shortage decrease in product quality and or higher expense in the event our subcontractor or foundry prioritize our competitor order over our order or otherwise in addition low manufacturing yield could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand increase manufacturing cost harm customer or partner relationship and or negatively impact our business operation gross margin revenue and or financial result manufacturing yield for our product are function of product design which is developed largely by and process technology which typically is proprietary to the foundry low yield may result from either product design or process technology failure we do not know whether yield problem will exist our design is actually manufactured by the foundry result yield problem may not be identified until well into the manufacturing process and require and the foundry to cooperate to resolve the problem we also rely on third party software development tool to assist in the design simulation and verification of new product or product enhancement and to bring such new product and enhancement to market in timely manner in the past we have experienced delay in the introduction of product and enhancement result of the inability of then available software development tool to fully simulate the complex feature and functionality of our product the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from our product may exceed the capability of available software development tool if we miss design cycle or lose design win due to the unavailability of such software development tool we could lose market share and our revenue could decline if we fail to achieve design win for our product our business will be harmed if our product contain significant defect we could incur significant expense to remediate such defect our reputation could be damaged and we could lose market share our product including both hardware and software offering are complex and may contain defect or security vulnerability or experience failure or unsatisfactory performance due to any number of issue in design fabrication packaging material and or use within system these risk may increase our product are introduced into new device market technology and application including into the automotive market or new version are released some error in our product or service may only be discovered after product or service ha been shipped or used by customer or the end user of such product undiscovered vulnerability in our product or service could expose our customer or end user to hacker or other unscrupulous third party who develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that could attack our product or service failure of our product to perform to specification or other product defect could lead to substantial damage to the product we sell directly to customer the end product in which our device ha been integrated by oems odms aibs and tier automotive supplier and to the user of such end product any such defect may cause to incur significant warranty support and repair or replacement cost write off the value of related inventory cause to lose market share and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development effort to find and correct the issue in addition an error or defect in new product or release or related software driver after commencement of commercial shipment could result in of contentsfailure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design win harm our relationship with customer and partner and harm consumer perception of our brand also we may be required to reimburse our customer partner or consumer including cost to repair or replace product in the field product recall including automotive recall or recall due to bug in our product or significant number of product return could be expensive damage our reputation harm our ability to attract new customer result in the shifting of business to our competitor and result in litigation such product liability suit if product liability claim is brought against the cost of defending the claim could be significant and would divert the effort of our technical and management personnel and harm our business further our business liability insurance may be inadequate or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable term which could adversely impact our financial result risk related to our operating businessif we fail to estimate customer demand properly our financial result could be harmed our product are manufactured based on estimate of customer future demand and our manufacturing lead time are long this could lead to significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortage or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain we sell many of our product through channel model and our channel customer sell to retailer distributor and or end customer result the decision made by our channel partner retailer and distributor in response to changing market condition and the changing demand for our product could impact our financial result in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that doe not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent up demand in period with limited availability of capacity and component in our supply chain we may place non cancellable inventory order significantly in advance of our normal lead time pay premium or provide deposit to secure normal and incremental future supply which could negatively impact our financial result demand for our product is based on many factor including our product introduction and transition competitor announcement and competing technology all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue for example our gpus for gaming are capable of digital currency mining demand and use of gpus for cryptocurrency ha fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly volatility in the cryptocurrency market including change in the price of cryptocurrencies can impact demand for our product and our ability to estimate demand for our product change to cryptocurrency standard and process including but not limited to the pending ethereum standard may also create increased aftermarket resale of our gpus and may reduce demand for our new gpus additionally consumer behavior during the covid pandemic such increased demand for our gaming data center and mobile workstation and laptop product and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstation ha made it more difficult for to estimate future demand and these challenge may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effect of the pandemic subside in estimating demand we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect if we are unable to accurately anticipate demand for our product our business and financial result could be adversely impacted situation that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include change in business and economic condition including downturn in our target market and or overall economy change in consumer confidence caused by change in market condition including change in the credit market sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence of rapidly changing technology or customer requirement our introduction of new product resulting in lower demand for older product le demand than expected for newly introduced product or increased competition including competitive pricing action the cancellation or deferral of customer purchase order could result in our holding excess inventory which could adversely affect our gross margin in addition because we often sell substantial portion of our product in the last month of each quarter we may not be able to reduce our inventory purchase commitment in timely manner in response to customer cancellation or deferral we could be required to write our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or excess inventory and we could experience reduction in average selling price if we incorrectly forecast product demand any of which could harm our financial result of contentsconversely if we underestimate our customer demand for our product our foundry partner may not have adequate lead time or capacity to increase production and we may not be able to obtain sufficient inventory to fill customer order on timely basis we may also face supply constraint caused by natural disaster or other event in such case even if we are able to increase production level to meet customer demand we may not be able to do so in cost effective or timely manner if we fail to fulfill our customer order on timely basis or at all our customer relationship could be damaged we could lose revenue and market share and our reputation could be damaged system security and data protection breach well cyber attack could disrupt our operation reduce our expected revenue and increase our expense which could adversely affect our stock price and damage our reputation security breach computer malware phishing and cyber attack have become more prevalent and sophisticated in recent year these threat are constantly evolving making it increasingly difficult to successfully defend against them or implement adequate preventative measure these attack have occurred on our system in the past and are expected to occur in the future experienced computer programmer hacker and employee may penetrate our security control and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of our employee or third party these attack may create system disruption or cause shutdown these hacker may also develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program that attack or otherwise exploit security vulnerability in our product including consumer and automotive product where we utilize over the air update to improve functionality over time for portion of our it infrastructure including business management and communication software product we rely on product and service provided by third party these provider may also experience breach and attack to their product which may impact our system for example in solarwinds inc one of our third party software service provider wa subject to data security breach to date our investigation of this breach which were supported by third party expert have not identified any adverse impact to nvidia data security breach may also result from non technical mean such action by an employee with access to our system to defend against security threat both to our internal system and those of our customer we must continuously engineer more secure product and enhance security and reliability feature which may result in increased expense we must also continue to develop security measure within nvidia ensure our supplier have appropriate security measure in place and continue to meet the evolving security requirement of our customer or our business could be negatively impacted actual or perceived breach of our security measure or the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about our partner our customer or third party could expose and the party affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information resulting in litigation and potential liability paying damage regulatory inquiry or action damage to our brand and reputation or other harm to our business our effort to prevent and overcome these challenge could increase our expense and may not be successful we may experience interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer such disruption could adversely impact our ability to fulfill order and interrupt other critical function delayed sale lower margin or lost customer result of these disruption could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation business disruption could harm our business lead to decline in revenue and increase our cost our worldwide operation could be disrupted by earthquake telecommunication failure power or water shortage outage at cloud service provider tsunami flood hurricane typhoon fire extreme weather condition cyber attack terrorist attack medical epidemic or pandemic including but not limited to covid and other natural or man made disaster catastrophic event or climate change the occurrence of any of these disruption could harm our business and result in significant loss decline in revenue and an increase in our cost and expense any of these business disruption could require substantial expenditure and recovery time in order to fully resume operation such risk are discussed further in the risk factor the covid pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation our corporate headquarters and portion of our research and development activity are located in california and other critical business operation finished good inventory and some of our supplier are located in asia near major earthquake fault known for seismic activity in addition large portion of our current data center capacity is located in california making our operation vulnerable to natural disaster or other business disruption occurring in these geographical area the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china hong kong israel and korea additionally significant portion of our finished good product distribution occurs through hong kong israel and taiwan geopolitical change or change in government regulation and policy in the united state or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirement trade policy import duty and economic disruption that could impact our operating strategy product demand access to global market hiring and profitability in particular revision to law or regulation or their interpretation and enforcement of contentscould result in increased taxation trade sanction the imposition of import duty or tariff restriction and control on import or export or other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business plan or impact the timing of our shipment for example regulation to implement the export control reform act of could have an adverse effect on our business plan catastrophic event can also have an impact on third party vendor who provide critical infrastructure service for it and research and development system and personnel in addition geopolitical and domestic political development such existing and potential trade war political or social unrest election and post election development and other event beyond our control can increase level of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial market political instability change in government or adverse political development in or around any of the major country in which we do business would also likely harm our business financial condition and result of operation our operation could be harmed if manufacturing logistics or other operation in these location are disrupted for any reason including natural disaster high heat event or water shortage other negative impact from climate change information technology system failure military action or economic business labor environmental public health regulatory or political issue the ultimate impact on our third party foundry and other supplier and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake fault and being consolidated in certain geographical area is unknown in the event major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affect or the third party system on which we rely our business could be harmed result of decline in revenue increase in expense substantial expenditure and time spent to fully resume operation all of these risk and condition could materially adversely affect our future sale and operating result the covid pandemic continues to impact our business and could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation covid ha spread worldwide resulting in government authority implementing numerous measure to try to contain the disease such travel ban and restriction quarantine shelter in place order and shutdown these measure have impacted and may further impact our workforce and operation the operation of our customer and our partner and those of our respective vendor and supplier including our subcontractor and third party contract manufacturer our critical business operation including our headquarters most of our finished good inventory and many of our key supplier are located in region which have been impacted by covid our customer and supplier worldwide have also been affected and may continue to be affected by covid related restriction and closure the covid pandemic ha increased economic and demand uncertainty it continues to affect our business in both positive and negative way and there is uncertainty around their duration and impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal year our gaming and data center market platform benefited from stronger demand people continue to work learn and play from home our professional visualization market platform benefited from work from home trend in mobile workstation and desktop workstation demand ha started to recover although not back to pre covid level in our automotive market platform covid not have significant impact on demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year in some region market or industry where covid ha driven an increase in sale for our product the demand may not be sustainable if condition change additionally stronger demand globally ha limited the availability of capacity and component in our supply chain particularly in gaming which could cause to order an excess amount if demand change pay higher price or limit our ability to obtain supply at necessary level or at all the covid pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customer and the availability of supply chain logistical service and component supply may have material net negative impact on our business and financial result the manufacture of product component the final assembly of our product and other critical operation are concentrated in certain geographic location including taiwan china hong kong israel and korea significant portion of our finished good product distribution occurs through hong kong israel and taiwan additionally our headquarters is located in california each of these country and location ha been affected by the pandemic and ha taken measure to try to contain it including restriction on manufacturing facility commerce travel on our support operation or workforce or on our customer partner vendor and supplier there is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact of such measure and potential future measure such measure well restriction or disruption of transportation such reduced availability or increased cost of air transport port closure and increased border control or closure could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation the spread of covid ha caused to modify our business practice including employee travel mandatory work from home policy and cancellation of physical participation in meeting event and conference and we may take further action required by government authority and regulation or that we determine are in the best interest of our employee customer partner and supplier most of our employee continue to work remotely there is no of contentscertainty that such measure will be sufficient to mitigate the risk posed by the disease and our ability to perform critical function could be harmed while the extent and duration of the covid pandemic on the global economy and our business is difficult to ass or predict the pandemic ha resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruption of global financial market which may reduce our ability to access capital or our customer ability to pay for past or future purchase which could negatively affect our liquidity recession or financial market correction resulting from the lack of containment and spread of covid could impact overall technology spending adversely affecting demand for our product our business and the value of our common stock the ultimate impact of the covid pandemic or similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change the extent of the impact of the covid pandemic on our operational and financial performance including our ability to execute our business strategy and initiative in the expected time frame will depend on future development including but not limited to the duration and continued spread of the pandemic it severity the action to contain the disease or treat it impact availability of vaccine or other treatment further related restriction on travel and the duration timing and severity of the impact on customer spending including any recession resulting from the pandemic all of which are uncertain and can not be predicted an extended period of global supply chain and economic disruption result of the covid pandemic could have material negative impact on our business result of operation access to source of liquidity and financial condition though the full extent and duration is uncertain we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefit of business acquisition or investment including the mellanox acquisition and the planned arm acquisition and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquisition target which could hurt our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product we have in the past acquired and invested in and may continue to acquire and invest in other business that offer product service and technology that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing product strategic objective and business we completed our acquisition of mellanox for approximately billion in april in september we announced our agreement to acquire all allotted and issued ordinary share of arm in transaction valued at billion the mellanox acquisition the planned arm acquisition and future acquisition or investment involve significant challenge and risk and could impair our ability to grow our business develop new product or sell our product and ultimately could have negative impact on our growth or our financial result given that our resource are limited our decision to pursue transaction ha opportunity cost accordingly if we pursue particular transaction we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transaction that could help achieve our strategic objective furthermore if we are unable to complete acquisition in timely manner including due to delay in obtaining regulatory approval we may be unable to pursue other transaction we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company technology may evolve making the acquisition le attractive and other change can take place which could jeopardize or reduce the anticipated benefit of the transaction and negatively impact our business in addition we have made and may in the future make strategic investment in private company and may not realize return on our investment additional risk related to the mellanox acquisition the planned arm acquisition and other acquisition or strategic investment include but are not limited to difficulty in combining the technology product or operation of the acquired business with our business difficulty in integrating and retaining the acquired workforce including key employee diversion of capital and other resource including management attention assumption of liability and incurring amortization expense impairment charge to goodwill or write down of acquired asset integrating financial forecasting and control procedure and reporting cycle coordinating and integrating operation in country in which we have not previously operated acquiring business challenge and risk including but not limited to dispute with management and integrating international operation and joint venture difficulty in realizing satisfactory return if any return at all difficulty in obtaining or inability to obtain governmental and regulatory consent and approval other approval or financing of content the potential impact of with complying with governmental or other regulatory restriction placed on an acquisition the potential impact on our stock price and financial result if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition are required to pay reverse breakup fee or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition failure and cost associated with the failure to consummate proposed acquisition or other strategic investment legal proceeding initiated result of an acquisition or investment the potential for our acquisition to result in dilutive issuance of our equity security the potential variability of the amount and form of any performance based consideration uncertainty and time needed to realize the benefit of an acquisition or strategic investment if at all negative change in general economic condition in the region or the industry in which we or our target operate the need to determine an alternative strategy if an acquisition doe not meet our expectation potential failure of our due diligence process to identify significant issue with the acquired asset or company and impairment of relationship with or loss of our or our target employee vendor and customer result of our acquisition or investment we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer within our partner network and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customer we receive significant amount of our revenue from limited number of customer within our distribution and partner network with several of these distributor and partner we are selling multiple target market platform through their channel our operating result in the foreseeable future will continue to depend on sale within our partner network well the ability of these partner to sell product that incorporate our processor in the future these partner may decide to purchase fewer product than they did in the past not to incorporate our product into their ecosystem or to alter their purchasing pattern in some other way particularly because most of our sale are made on purchase order basis which permit our customer to cancel change or delay product purchase commitment with little or no notice to and without penalty our partner may develop their own solution our customer may purchase product from our competitor or our partner may discontinue sale or lose market share in the market for which they purchase our product we could also be restricted from selling our product or providing our technology and service due to trade restriction the loss of any of our large customer significant reduction in purchase by them or our inability to sell to customer due to trade restriction would likely harm our financial condition and result of operation and any difficulty in collecting account receivable could harm our operating result and financial condition we maintain an allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of certain of our customer to make required payment and obtain credit insurance over the purchasing credit extended to these customer in the future we may have to record additional provision or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sale transaction which could negatively impact our financial result and we may not be able to acquire credit insurance on the credit we extend to these customer or in amount that we deem sufficient we are subject to risk and uncertainty associated with international operation including adverse economic condition which may harm our business we conduct our business worldwide and we have office in various country outside of the united state our semiconductor wafer are manufactured assembled tested and packaged by third party located outside of the united state we also generate significant portion of our revenue from sale outside the united state we allocate revenue of contentsto individual country based on the location to which the product are initially billed even if our customer revenue is attributable to end customer that are located in different location revenue from sale outside of the united state accounted for of total revenue for fiscal year for fiscal year and for fiscal year revenue from billing to china including hong kong wa of our revenue for fiscal year additionally of january approximately of our employee were located outside of the united state the global nature of our business subject to number of risk and uncertainty which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation including international economic and political condition and other political tension between country in

well impose administrative fine since the enactment of the ccpa more than half of the state in the united state and the united state congress have considered proposed privacy legislation reflecting trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the united state the interpretation and application of consumer and data protection law in the united state europe and elsewhere are often uncertain

stated value in the purchase agreement we believe the closing of the acquisition will likely occur in the first quarter of calendar year demandour product are manufactured based on estimate of customer future demand and our manufacturing lead time are very long this could lead to significant mismatch between supply and demand giving rise to product shortage or excess inventory and make our demand forecast more uncertain we sell many of our product through channel model and our channel customer sell to retailer distributor and or end customer result the decision made of contentsby our channel partner retailer and distributor in response to changing market condition and the changing demand for our product could impact our financial result in order to have shorter shipment lead time and quicker delivery schedule for our customer we may build inventory for anticipated period of growth which do not occur may build inventory anticipating demand that doe not materialize or may build inventory to serve what we believe is pent up demand in period with limited availability of capacity and component in our supply chain we may place non cancellable inventory order significantly in advance of our normal lead time pay premium or provide deposit to secure normal and incremental future supply which could negatively impact our financial result demand for our product is based on many factor including our product introduction and transition competitor announcement and competing technology all of which can impact the timing and amount of our revenue for example our gpus for gaming are capable of digital currency mining demand and use of gpus for cryptocurrency ha fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to change quickly volatility in the cryptocurrency market including change in the price of cryptocurrencies can impact demand for our product and our ability to estimate demand for our product change to cryptocurrency standard and process including but not limited to the pending ethereum standard may also create increased aftermarket resale of our gpus and may reduce demand for our new gpus additionally consumer behavior during the covid pandemic such increased demand for our gaming data center and mobile workstation and laptop product and suppressed corporate demand for desktop workstation ha made it more difficult for to estimate future demand and these challenge may be more pronounced in the future if and when the effect of the pandemic subside in estimating demand and evaluating trend we make multiple assumption any of which may prove to be incorrect covid worldwide covid pandemic is prompting government and business to take unprecedented measure including restriction on travel temporary business closure quarantine and shelter in place order it ha significantly impacted global economic activity and caused volatility and disruption in global financial market since march most of our employee have been working remotely and we have temporarily prohibited most business travel our gaming and data center market platform have benefited from stronger demand people continue to work learn and play from home in professional visualization mobile workstation continue to benefit from work from home trend and desktop workstation demand ha started to recover although not back to pre covid level in automotive covid is no longer significant impact on demand throughout our supply chain stronger demand globally ha limited the availability of capacity and component particularly in gaming the covid pandemic continues the timing and overall demand from customer and the availability of supply chain logistical service and component supply may have material net negative impact on our business and financial result refer to

eliminated in consolidation use of estimatesthe preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement and the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period actual result could differ materially from our estimate on an on going basis we evaluate our estimate including those related to revenue recognition cash equivalent and marketable security account receivable inventory income tax goodwill stock based compensation litigation investigation and settlement cost restructuring and other charge and other contingency the input into our judgment and estimate consider the economic implication of covid these estimate are based on historical fact and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable revenue recognitionwe derive our revenue from product sale including hardware and system license and development arrangement and software licensing we determine revenue recognition through the following step identification of the contract with customer identification of the performance obligation in the contract determination of the transaction price allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation in the contract where revenue is allocated on relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable input to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation and recognition of revenue when or we satisfy performance obligation product sale revenuerevenue from product sale is recognized upon transfer of control of promised product to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product certain product are sold along with support or extended warranty support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed revenue is recognized net of allowance for return customer program and any tax collected from customer for product sold with right of return we record reduction to revenue by establishing sale return allowance for estimated product return at the time revenue is recognized based primarily on historical return rate however if product return for fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rate we may determine that additional sale return allowance are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product return our customer program involve rebate which are designed to serve sale incentive to resellers of our product in various target market and marketing development fund or mdfs which represent monies paid to our partner that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partner activity while also promoting nvidia product we account for customer program reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebate and mdfs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customer of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued license and development arrangementsour license and development arrangement with customer typically require significant customization of our intellectual property component result we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development service single performance obligation over the period in which the development service are performed we measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project if loss on an arrangement becomes probable during period we record provision for such loss in that period software licensingour software license provide our customer with right to use the software when it is made available to the customer customer may purchase either perpetual license or subscription to license which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefit from the software software license are frequently sold along with post contract customer support or pc revenue from software license is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer pc revenue is recognized ratably over the service period or service are performed product warrantieswe generally offer limited warranty to end user that range from one to three year for product in order to repair or replace product for any manufacturing defect or hardware component failure cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranty that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition under limited circumstance we may offer an extended limited warranty to customer for certain product we also accrue for known warranty and indemnification issue if loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated stock based compensationwe use the closing trading price of our common stock on the date of grant minus dividend yield discount the fair value of award of restricted stock unit or rsus and performance stock unit that are based on our corporate financial performance target or psus we use monte carlo simulation on the date of grant to estimate the fair value of performance stock unit that are based on market condition or market based psus the compensation expense for rsus and market based psus is recognized using straight line attribution method over the requisite employee service period while compensation expense for psus is recognized using an accelerated amortization model we estimate the fair value of share to be issued under our employee stock purchase plan or espp using the black scholes model at the commencement of an offering period in march and september of each year stock based compensation for our espp is expensed using an accelerated amortization model additionally we estimate forfeiture annually based on historical experience and revise the estimate of forfeiture in subsequent period if actual forfeiture differ from those estimate litigation investigation and settlement costsfrom time to time we are involved in legal action and or investigation by regulatory body there are many uncertainty associated with any litigation or investigation and we can not be certain that these action or other third party claim against will be resolved without litigation fine and or substantial settlement payment if information becomes available that cause to determine that loss in any of our pending litigation investigation or settlement is probable and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such event we will record the loss in accordance with gaap however the actual liability in any such litigation or investigation may be materially different from our estimate which could require to record additional cost foreign currency remeasurementwe use the united state dollar our functional currency for all of our subsidiary foreign currency monetary asset and liability are remeasured into united state dollar at end of period exchange rate non monetary asset and liability such property and equipment and equity are remeasured at historical exchange rate revenue and expense are remeasured at average exchange rate in effect during each period except for those expense related to the previously noted balance sheet amount which are remeasured at historical exchange rate gain or loss from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income or expense in our consolidated statement of income and to date have not been significant of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued income taxeswe recognize federal state and foreign current tax liability or asset based on our estimate of tax payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction we recognize federal state and foreign deferred tax asset or liability appropriate for our estimate of future tax effect attributable to temporary difference and carryforwards and we record valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax asset by the amount of any tax benefit that based on available evidence and judgment are not expected to be realized our calculation of deferred tax asset and liability is based on certain estimate and judgment and involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law our estimate of deferred tax asset and liability may change based in part on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome change in accounting standard or tax law in the united state or foreign jurisdiction where we operate or change in other fact or circumstance in addition we recognize liability for potential united state and foreign income tax contingency based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional tax may be due if we determine that payment of these amount is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is le than our current assessment we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statement accordingly of january we had valuation allowance of million related to state and certain foreign deferred tax asset that management determined are not likely to be realized due to jurisdictional projection of future taxable income tax attribute usage limitation by certain jurisdiction and potential utilization limitation of tax attribute acquired result of stock ownership change to the extent realization of the deferred tax asset becomes more likely than not we would recognize such deferred tax asset an income tax benefit during the period we recognize the benefit from tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merit of the tax position our policy is to include interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit component of income tax expense net income per sharebasic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period diluted net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive share outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method under the treasury stock method the effect of equity award outstanding is not included in the computation of diluted net income per share for period when their effect is anti dilutive cash and cash equivalent and marketable securitieswe consider all highly liquid investment

consolidated statement of income all of our available for sale debt investment are subject to periodic impairment review if the estimated fair value of an available for sale debt security is le than it amortized cost basis we determine if the difference if any is caused by expected credit loss and write down the amortized cost basis of the security if it is more likely than not we will be required or we intend to sell the security before recovery of it amortized cost basis allowance for credit loss and write down are recognized in other income expense net section of our consolidated

concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalent marketable security and account receivable our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income security the diversification of investment type and credit exposure and includes certain limit on our portfolio duration we perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customer financial condition and maintain an allowance for potential credit loss this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customer and an amount based on overall estimated exposure our overall estimated exposure excludes amount covered by credit insurance and letter of credit account receivablewe maintain an allowance for doubtful account receivable for expected loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment we determine this allowance by identifying amount for specific customer issue well amount based on overall estimated exposure factor impacting the allowance include the level of

memory product and other component part we charge cost of sale for inventory provision to write down our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value or for obsolete or excess inventory most of our inventory provision relate to excess quantity of product based on our inventory level and future product purchase commitment compared to assumption about future demand and market condition inventory ha been written off or written down it creates new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written up property and equipmentproperty and equipment are stated at cost depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of the asset generally three to five year once an asset is identified for retirement or disposition the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and gain or loss is recorded the estimated useful life of our building are up to thirty year

extend or terminate the lease of contentsnvidia corporation and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statement continued when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term we combine the lease and non lease component in determining the operating lease asset and liability goodwillgoodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or earlier if indicator of potential impairment exist for the purpose of completing our impairment test we perform either qualitative or quantitative analysis on reporting unit basis qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance and other relevant event and factor affecting the reporting unit our quantitative impairment test considers both the income approach and the market approach to estimate reporting unit fair value the income and market valuation approach consider number of factor that include but are not limited to prospective financial information growth rate residual value discount rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry and require to make certain assumption and estimate regarding industry economic factor and the future profitability of our business intangible asset and other long lived assetsintangible asset primarily represent acquired intangible asset including developed technology in process research and development or ipr and customer relationship well right acquired under technology license patent and acquired intellectual property we currently amortize our intangible asset with finite life over period ranging from two to twenty year using method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefit of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up or if that pattern can not be reliably determined using straight line amortization method we initially capitalize the fair value of ipr an intangible asset with an indefinite life when ipr project are completed we reclassify the ipr an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortize over the asset estimated useful life long lived asset such property and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset or asset group to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group fair value is determined based on the estimated discounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group asset and liability to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheet and the asset would be reported at the lower

acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired including ipr based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of the purchase price over the fair value of these net tangible and intangible asset acquired is recorded goodwill management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but our estimate and assumption are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement the estimate and assumption used in valuing intangible asset include but are not limited to the amount and timing of projected future cash flow discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flow and asset life these estimate are inherently uncertain and therefore actual result may differ from the estimate made result during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition whichever come first any subsequent adjustment are recorded to our consolidated statement of income acquisition related expense
