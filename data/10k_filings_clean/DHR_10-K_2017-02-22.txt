agency and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such product in one or more country and may give rise to claim for damage from person who believe they have been injured result of product issue manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problem manufacturing product our reputation business and financial statement could suffer the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem may arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material natural disaster and environmental factor and if not discovered before the product is released to market could result in recall and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facility and other stringent regulation of the fda regarding the manufacture of certain of our product an alternative manufacturer may not be available on timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problem could result in significant cost liability and lost revenue well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product our indebtedness may limit our operation and our use of our cash flow and any failure to comply with the covenant that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement of december we had approximately billion in outstanding indebtedness in addition of december we had the ability to incur approximately an additional billion of indebtedness in direct borrowing or under outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amount available under the company billion of credit facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balance our debt level and related debt service obligation can have negative consequence including requiring to dedicate significant cash flow from operation to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the fund we have available for other purpose such acquisition and capital investment reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and market condition and exposing to interest rate risk since portion of our debt obligation are at variable rate we may incur significantly more debt in the future particularly to finance acquisition and there can be no assurance that our cost of funding will not substantially increase our current revolving credit facility and long term debt obligation also impose certain restriction on for more information refer to the md if we breach any of these restriction and do not obtain waiver from the lender subject to applicable cure period the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with cross default provision could be declared immediately due and payable which would adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement in addition any failure to maintain the credit rating assigned to by independent rating agency would adversely affect our cost of fund and could adversely affect our liquidity and access to the capital market if we add new debt the risk described above could increase adverse change in our relationship with or the financial condition performance purchasing pattern or inventory level of key distributor and other channel partner could adversely affect our financial statement certain of our business sell significant amount of their product to key distributor and other channel partner that have valuable relationship with customer and end user some of these distributor and other partner also sell our competitor product or compete with directly and if they favor competing product for any reason they may fail to market our product effectively adverse change in our relationship with these distributor and other partner or adverse development in their financial condition performance or purchasing pattern could adversely affect our business and financial statement the level of inventory maintained by our distributor and other channel partner and change in those level can also significantly impact our result of operation in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributor and customer in certain of our served industry could adversely impact our business and financial statement certain of our business rely on relationship with collaborative partner and other third party for development supply and marketing of certain product and potential product and such collaborative partner or other third party could fail to perform sufficiently we believe that for certain of our business success in penetrating target market depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationship with other company relying on collaborative relationship is risky because among other thing our collaborative partner may not devote sufficient resource to the success of our collaboration may not obtain regulatory approval necessary to continue the collaboration in timely manner may be acquired by other company and decide to terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent may compete with may not agree with on key detail of the collaborative relationship may not have sufficient capital resource and may not agree to renew existing collaboration on acceptable term because these and other factor may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our product involved in collaborative partnership may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partner terminate collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resource to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development program which could adversely affect our business and financial statement financial result are subject to fluctuation in the cost and availability of commodity that we use in our operation discussed in item business material our manufacturing and other operation employ wide variety of component raw material and other commodity price for and availability of these component raw material and other commodity have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these item could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industry that we serve the cost containment effort of our customer and the term of certain contract we are party to if commodity price rise we may be unable to pas along cost increase through higher price if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity cost through price increase or offset these increase through cost reduction or if there is time delay between the increase in cost and our ability to recover or offset these cost we could experience lower margin and profitability and our financial statement could be adversely affected if we can not adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchase required for our manufacturing activity to reflect change in market condition and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited source of supply for certain material component and service could cause production interruption delay and inefficiency we purchase material component and equipment from third party for use in our manufacturing operation our income could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchase to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during market upturn supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price if we can not purchase sufficient product at competitive price and quality and on timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipment may be delayed our cost may increase or we may breach our contractual commitment and incur liability conversely in order to secure supply for the production of product we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitment with vendor which could impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demand if demand for our product is le than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventory and be forced to incur additional charge and our profitability may suffer in addition some of our business purchase certain requirement from sole or limited source supplier for reason of quality assurance regulatory requirement cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other supplier encounter financial operating or other difficulty or if our relationship with them change we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement source of supply the supply chain for our business could also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraint bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reason decreased availability of key raw material or commodity and external event such natural disaster pandemic health issue war terrorist action governmental action and legislative or regulatory change any of these factor could result in production interruption delay extended lead time and inefficiency because we can not always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structure to changing market condition our manufacturing capacity may at time exceed or fall short of our production requirement any or all of these problem could result in the loss of customer provide an opportunity for competing product to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statement change in governmental regulation may reduce demand for our product or service or increase our expense we compete in market in which we and our customer must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulation such regulation governing health and safety the environment food and drug privacy and electronic communication we develop configure and market our product and service to meet customer need created by these regulation these regulation are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdiction any significant change in any of these regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof could reduce demand for increase our cost of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified product and service or could restrict our existing activity product and service in addition in certain of our market our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulation in these market the delay or failure of governmental and other entity to adopt or enforce new regulation the adoption of new regulation which our product and service are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulation could adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadline may result in substantially different level of demand for our product and service from period to period work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute could adversely impact our productivity and result of operation we have number of collective bargaining unit and various non collective labor arrangement we are subject to potential work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute any of which could adversely impact our financial statement and business including our productivity and reputation economic political legal compliance and business factor could negatively affect our financial statement in approximately of our sale were derived from customer outside the united state in addition many of our manufacturing operation supplier and employee are located outside the united state since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate market outside the united state and increase the localization of our product and service we expect to continue to increase our sale and presence outside the united state particularly in the high growth market our international business and particularly our business in high growth market is subject to risk that are customarily encountered in non operation including interruption in the transportation of material to and finished good to our customer difference in term of sale including payment term local product preference and product requirement change in country or region political or economic condition such the devaluation of particular currency trade protection measure embargo and import or export restriction and requirement unexpected change in law or regulatory requirement including change in tax law limitation on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash the potential for nationalization of enterprise change in medical reimbursement policy and program limitation on legal right and our ability to enforce such right difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operation differing labor regulation difficulty in implementing restructuring action on timely or comprehensive basis and differing protection of intellectual property any of these risk could negatively affect our financial statement and business including our growth rate the result of the eu membership referendum in the united kingdom could adversely affect customer demand our relationship with customer and supplier and our business and financial statement the result of the united kingdom referendum on eu membership advising for the exit of the united kingdom from the eu ha caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock market currency exchange rate fluctuation and global economic uncertainty although it is unknown the term of the united kingdom future relationship with the eu will be it is possible that there will be greater restriction on import and export between the united kingdom and eu and increased regulatory complexity any of these factor could adversely affect customer demand our relationship with customer and supplier and our business and financial statement if we suffer loss to our facility supply chain distribution system or information technology system due to catastrophe or other event our operation could be seriously harmed our facility supply chain distribution system and information technology system are subject to catastrophic loss due to fire flood earthquake hurricane public health crisis war terrorism or other natural or man made disaster if any of these facility supply chain or system were to experience catastrophic loss it could disrupt our operation delay production and shipment result in defective product or service damage customer relationship and our reputation and result in legal exposure and large repair or replacement expense the third party insurance coverage that we maintain will vary from time to time in both type and amount depending on cost availability and our decision regarding risk retention and may be unavailable or insufficient to protect against such loss our defined benefit pension plan are subject to financial market risk that could adversely affect our financial statement the performance of the financial market and interest rate impact our defined benefit pension plan expense and funding obligation significant change in market interest rate decrease in the fair value of plan asset

interest rate riskthe company manages interest cost using mixture of fixed rate and variable rate debt change in interest rate on long term debt impact the fair value of the company fixed rate long term debt but not the company earnings or cash flow because the interest on such debt is fixed generally the fair market value of fixed rate debt will increase interest rate fall of contentsand

company financial condition and result of operation is based upon the company consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state the preparation of these financial statement requires management to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability the company base these estimate and judgment on historical experience the current economic environment and on various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ materially from these estimate and judgment the company belief the following accounting estimate are most critical to an understanding of it financial statement estimate are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criterion the estimate requires assumption about material matter that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and material change in the estimate are reasonably likely from period to period for detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting estimate refer to note to the consolidated financial statement acquired intangible the company business acquisition typically result in the recognition of goodwill in process research and development and other intangible asset which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment charge that the company may incur refer to note and to the consolidated financial statement for description of the company policy relating to goodwill acquired intangible and acquisition of contentsin performing it goodwill impairment testing the company estimate the fair value of it reporting unit primarily using market based approach the company estimate fair value based on multiple of earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda determined by current trading market multiple of earnings for company operating in business similar to each of the company reporting unit in addition to recent market available sale transaction of comparable business in evaluating the estimate derived by the market based approach management make judgment about the relevance and reliability of the multiple by considering factor unique to it reporting unit including operating result business plan economic projection anticipated future cash flow and transaction and marketplace data well judgment about the comparability of the market proxy selected in certain circumstance the company also estimate fair value utilizing discounted cash flow analysis an income approach in order to validate the result of the market approach the discounted cash flow model requires judgmental assumption about projected revenue growth future operating margin discount rate and terminal value there are inherent uncertainty related to these assumption and management judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment of december the company had eight reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing reporting unit resulting from recent acquisition generally present the highest risk of impairment management belief the impairment risk associated with these reporting unit decrease these business are integrated into the company and better positioned for potential future earnings growth of the date of the annual impairment test the carrying value of the goodwill included in each individual reporting unit ranged from million to approximately billion the company annual goodwill impairment analysis in indicated that in all instance the fair value of the company reporting unit exceeded their carrying value and consequently did not result in an impairment charge the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit of the annual testing date ranged from approximately to approximately in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation used in the goodwill impairment test the company applied hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit and compared those hypothetical value to the reporting unit carrying value based on this hypothetical decrease the excess of the estimated fair value over carrying value expressed percentage of carrying value for the respective reporting unit for each of the company reporting unit ranged from approximately to approximately the company review identified intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable the company also test intangible asset with indefinite life at least annually for impairment determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparison of the carrying amount to the sum of undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated by the asset these analysis require management to make judgment and estimate about future revenue expense market condition and discount rate related to these asset if actual result are not consistent with management estimate and assumption goodwill and other intangible asset may be overstated and charge would need to be taken against net earnings which would adversely affect the company financial statement contingent liability discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement the company is from time to time subject to variety of litigation and similar contingent liability incidental to it business or the business operation of previously owned entity the company recognizes liability for any contingency that is known or probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable these assessment require judgment concerning matter such litigation development and outcome the anticipated outcome of negotiation the number of future claim and the cost of both pending and future claim in addition because most contingency are resolved over long period of time liability may change in the future due to various factor including those discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement if the reserve established by the company with respect to these contingent liability are inadequate the company would be required to incur an expense equal to the amount of the loss incurred in excess of the reserve which would adversely affect the company financial statement revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of product and service refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for description of the company revenue recognition policy although most of the company sale agreement contain standard term and condition certain agreement contain multiple element or nonstandard term and condition result judgment is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting including whether the deliverable specified in these agreement should be treated separate unit of accounting for revenue recognition purpose and if so how the consideration should be allocated among the element and when to recognize revenue for each element the company allocates revenue to each element in the contractual arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy that in some instance may require the company to estimate the selling price of certain deliverable that are not sold separately or where third party evidence of pricing is not observable the company estimate of selling price impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangement the company also enters into lease of contentsarrangements with customer which requires the company to determine whether the arrangement are operating or sale type lease certain of the company lease contract are customized for larger customer and often result in complex term and condition that typically require significant judgment in applying the lease accounting criterion if the company judgment regarding revenue recognition prove incorrect the company reported revenue in particular period may be adversely affected pension and other postretirement benefit for description of the company pension and other postretirement benefit accounting practice refer to note and to the consolidated financial statement calculation of the amount of pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation depend on the assumption used in the actuarial valuation including assumption regarding discount rate expected return on plan asset rate of salary increase health care cost trend rate mortality rate and other factor if the assumption used in calculating pension and other postretirement benefit cost and obligation are incorrect or if the factor underlying the assumption change result of difference in actual experience change in key economic indicator or other factor the company financial statement could be materially affected basis point reduction in the discount rate used for the plan would have increased the net obligation by million million on an after tax basis and the non net obligation by million million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statement of december basis point increase in the discount rate used for the plan would have decreased the net obligation by million million on an after tax basis and the non net obligation by million million on an after tax basis from the amount recorded in the consolidated financial statement of december for the estimated long term rate of return for the plan are and the company intends to continue to use an assumption of for this expected rate of return reflects the asset allocation of the plan and the expected long term return on equity and debt investment included in plan asset the plan target to invest between and of it asset in equity portfolio which are invested in fund that are expected to mirror broad market return for equity security or in asset with characteristic similar to equity investment the balance of the asset portfolio is generally invested in bond fund the company non plan asset consist of various insurance contract equity and debt security determined by the administrator of each plan the estimated long term rate of return for the non plan wa determined on plan by plan basis based on the nature of the plan asset and ranged from to if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset for wa reduced by basis point pension expense for the and non plan for would have increased million million on an after tax basis and million million on an after tax

difference expected future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategy future change to tax rate would also impact the amount of deferred tax asset and liability and could have an adverse impact on the company financial statement the company provides for unrecognized tax benefit when based upon the technical merit it is more likely than not that an uncertain tax position will not be
