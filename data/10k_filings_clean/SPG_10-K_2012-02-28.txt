adjust to reflect inflationary increase we have converted substantial portion of our lease to fixed payment methodology which fix our tenant cam contribution and should in turn reduce the volatility of and limitation on the recovery we collect from our tenant for the reimbursement of our property operating expense however with respect to both variable and fixed payment methodology the amount of cam charge we bill to our tenant may not allow to recover all of these operating cost we face wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably our property compete with
