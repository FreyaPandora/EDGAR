of the largest electric utility in the at december fpl approximately mw of net generating capacity approximately circuit mile of transmission and distribution line and substation fpl provides service to it electric customer through an integrated transmission and distribution system that link it generation facility to it customer at december fpl served more than ten million people through more than five million customer account fpl service territory which cover of the east and lower west coast of florida and plant location at december were follows see fpl source of generation below of contentscustomers and revenuefpl primary source of operating revenue is from it retail customer base it also serf limited number of wholesale customer within florida the percentage of fpl operating revenue and customer account by customer class were follows for both retail and wholesale customer the price or rate that fpl may charge are approved by regulatory body by the fpsc in the case of retail customer and by the ferc in the case of wholesale customer in general under and florida law regulated rate are intended to cover the cost of providing service including reasonable rate of return on invested capital since the regulatory body have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed there can be no guarantee that fpl will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of it cost through regulated rate see fpl regulation below fpl seek to maintain attractive rate for it customer since rate are largely cost based maintaining low rate requires strategy focused on developing and maintaining low cost position including the implementation of idea generated from cost saving initiative common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rate across company is the price of kwh of consumption per month for residential customer fpl average bill for kwh of monthly residential usage wa well below both the average of reporting electric utility within florida and the july national average the latest date for which this data is available indicated below of contentsfranchise agreement and competitionfpl service to it electric retail customer is provided primarily under franchise agreement negotiated with municipality or county during the term of franchise agreement which

municipality and county in florida with varying expiration date through franchise agreement cover approximately of fpl retail customer base in florida fpl also provides service to other municipality and to unincorporated area within it service area without franchise agreement pursuant to the general obligation to serve public utility fpl relies upon florida law for access to public right of way any customer may elect to provide own electric service fpl effectively must compete for an individual customer business practical matter customer provide their own service at the present time since fpl cost of service is lower than the cost of self generation for the vast majority of customer changing technology economic condition and other factor could alter the favorable relative cost position that fpl currently enjoys however fpl seek matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value in the form of low customer bill high reliability and outstanding customer service in addition to self generation by residential commercial and industrial customer fpl also face competition from other supplier of electrical energy to wholesale customer and from alternative energy source in each of and operating revenue from wholesale and industrial electric customer combined represented approximately five percent of fpl total operating revenue for the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of mw or greater the fpsc requires investor owned electric utility including fpl to issue request for proposal rfp except the fpsc determines that an exception from the rfp process is in the public interest the rfp process allows independent power producer and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity if bidder ha the most cost effective alternative meet other criterion such financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and or operating generating capacity of the type proposed the investor owned electric utility would seek to negotiate purchased power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the fpsc approve the term of the purchased power agreement and if appropriate provide the required authorization

expiration or in the case of duane arnold through shutdown of the facility policy incentive for renewable energy projectsu federal state and local government have established various incentive to support the development of renewable energy project these incentive include accelerated tax depreciation ptcs itcs cash grant tax abatement and rps program pursuant to the federal modified accelerated cost recovery system wind and solar project are fully depreciated for tax purpose over five year period even though the useful life of such project is generally much longer than five year owner of utility scale wind facility are eligible to claim an income tax credit the ptc or an itc in lieu of the ptc upon initially achieving commercial operation the ptc is determined based on the amount of electricity produced by the wind facility during the first ten year of commercial operation this incentive wa created under the energy policy act of and ha been extended several time alternatively an itc equal to of the cost of wind facility may be claimed in lieu of the ptc owner of solar facility are eligible to claim itc for new solar facility previously owner of solar facility could have elected to receive an equivalent cash payment from the department of treasury for the value of the itc convertible itc for qualifying solar facility where construction began before the end of and the facility were placed in service before in order to qualify for the ptc or an itc in lieu of the ptc for wind or itc for solar construction of facility must begin before specified date and the taxpayer must maintain continuous program of construction or continuous effort to advance the project to completion the internal revenue service irs issued guidance stating that the safe harbor for continuous effort and continuous construction requirement will generally be satisfied if the facility is placed in service no more than four year after the year in which construction of the facility began the irs also confirmed that retrofitted wind facility may qualify for ptcs or itcs pursuant to the safe harbor for the begin construction requirement long the cost basis of the new investment is at least of the facility total fair value tax credit for qualifying wind and solar project are subject to the following phase down schedule year construction of project begin wind itc solar itc _________________________ percentage of the full ptc available for wind project that begin construction during the applicable year percentage of eligible project cost that can be claimed itc by wind project that begin construction during the applicable year percentage of eligible project cost that can be claimed itc by solar project that begin construction during the applicable year itc is limited to for solar project not placed in service before january other country including canada and spain provide for incentive like feed in tariff for renewable energy project the feed in tariff promote renewable energy investment by offering long term contract to renewable energy producer typically based on the cost of generation of each technology of contentsmarkets and competitionelectricity market in the and canada are regional and diverse in character all are extensively regulated and competition in these market is shaped and constrained by regulation the nature of the product offered varies based on the specific of regulation in each region generally in addition to the natural constraint on pricing freedom presented by competition neer may also face specific constraint in the form of price cap or maximum allowed price for certain product neer ability to sell the output of it generation facility may also be constrained by available transmission capacity which can vary from time to time and can have significant impact on pricing the degree and nature of competition is different in wholesale market than in retail market during and approximately of neer revenue wa derived from wholesale electricity market wholesale power generation is capital intensive commodity driven business with numerous industry participant neer primarily competes on the basis of price but belief the green attribute of neer generation asset it creditworthiness and it ability to offer and manage reliable customized risk solution to wholesale customer are competitive advantage wholesale power generation is regional business that is highly fragmented relative to many other commodity industry and diverse in term of industry structure such there is wide variation in term of the capability resource nature and identity of the company neer competes with depending on the market in wholesale market customer need are met through variety of mean including long term bilateral contract standardized bilateral product such full requirement service and customized supply and risk management service in general and canadian electricity market encompass three class of service energy capacity and ancillary service energy service relate to the physical delivery of power capacity service relate to the availability of mw capacity of power generation asset and ancillary service are other service that relate to power generation asset such load regulation and spinning and non spinning reserve the exact nature of these class of service is defined in part by regional tariff not all region have capacity service class and the specific definition of ancillary service vary from region to region rtos and isos exist throughout much of north america to coordinate generation and transmission across wide geographic area and to run market neer operates in all rto and iso jurisdiction at december neer also had generation facility with ownership interest in total net generating capacity of approximately mw that fall within reliability region that are not under the jurisdiction of an established rto or iso including mw within the western electricity coordinating council and mw within the florida reliability coordinating council although each rto and iso may have differing objective and structure some benefit of these entity include regional planning managing transmission congestion developing larger wholesale market for energy and capacity maintaining reliability and facilitating competition among wholesale electricity provider neer ha operation that fall within the following rtos and isos of contentsneer competes in different region to differing degree but in general it seek to enter into long term bilateral contract for the full output of it generation facility at december approximately of neer net generating capacity wa committed under long term contract where long term contract are not in effect neer sell the output of it facility into daily spot market in such case neer will frequently enter into shorter term bilateral contract typically of le than three year duration to hedge the price risk associated with selling into daily spot market such bilateral contract which may be hedge either for physical delivery or for financial pricing offset serve to protect portion of the revenue that neer expects to derive from the associated generation facility contract that serve the economic purpose of hedging some portion of the expected revenue of generation facility but are not recorded hedge under gaap are referred to non qualifying hedge for adjusted earnings purpose see management discussion overview adjusted earnings certain facility within the neer wind and solar generation portfolio produce recs and other environmental attribute which are typically sold along with the energy from the plant under long term contract or may be sold separately for the wind and solar generation not sold under long term contract the purchasing party is solely entitled to the reporting right and ownership of the environmental attribute the majority of neer revenue is derived from the output of it generation facility neer is also an active competitor in several region in the wholesale full requirement business and in providing structured and customized power and fuel product and service to variety of customer in the full requirement service typically the supplier agrees to meet the customer need for full range of product for every hour of the day at fixed price for predetermined period of time thereby assuming the risk of fluctuation in the customer volume requirement expanded competition in frequently changing regulatory environment present both opportunity and risk for neer opportunity exist for the selective acquisition of generation asset and for the construction and operation of efficient facility that can sell power in competitive market neer seek to reduce it market risk by diversified portfolio by fuel type and location well by contracting for the future sale of significant amount of the electricity output of it facility neer regulationthe energy market in which neer operates are subject to domestic and foreign regulation the case may be including local state and federal regulation and other specific rule at december essentially all of neer operating independent power project located in the have received exempt wholesale generator status defined under the public utility holding company act of exempt wholesale generator own or operate facility exclusively to sell

policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement which were prepared under gaap critical accounting policy are those that nee belief are both most important to the portrayal of it financial condition and result of operation and require complex subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption nee considers the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that are involved in preparing it consolidated financial statement accounting for derivative and hedging activitiesnee us derivative instrument primarily swap option future and forward to manage the physical and financial risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity well interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuance and borrowing in addition nee through neer us derivative to optimize the value of it power generation and gas infrastructure asset and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activity to take advantage of expected future favorable price movement nature of accounting estimatesaccounting pronouncement require the use of fair value accounting if certain condition are met which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of asset and liability this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instrument but to any contract having the accounting characteristic of derivative result significant judgment must be used in applying derivative accounting guidance to contract in the event change in interpretation occur it is possible that contract that currently are excluded from derivative accounting rule would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with change in the fair value recorded in the statement of income assumption and accounting approachderivative instrument when required to be marked to market are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using combination of market and income approach fair value for some of the longer term contract where liquid market are not available are derived through the use of industry standard valuation technique such internally developed model which estimate the fair value of contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward price forward price represent the price at which buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell commodity at future date the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the price in the early year of the forward curve reflect observable market quote however in the later year the market is much le liquid and forward price curve must be developed using factor including the forward price for the commodity used fuel to generate electricity the expected system heat rate which measure the efficiency of power plant in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale take place and fundamental forecast of expected spot price based on modeled supply and demand in the region nee estimate the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivative using an income approach based on discounted cash flow valuation technique utilizing the net of contentsamount of estimated future cash inflow and outflow related to the derivative agreement the assumption in these model are critical since any change therein could have significant impact on the fair value of the derivative at fpl substantially all change in the fair value of energy derivative transaction are deferred regulatory asset or liability until the contract are settled and upon settlement any gain or loss are passed through the fuel clause see note in nee non rate regulated operation predominantly neer essentially all change in the derivative fair value for power purchase and sale fuel sale and trading activity are recognized on net basis in operating revenue fuel purchase used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel purchased power and interchange expense and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income for interest rate and foreign currency derivative instrument essentially all change in the derivative fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income nee estimate the fair value of these derivative using an income approach based on discounted cash flow valuation technique utilizing observable input certain derivative transaction at neer are entered into economic hedge but the transaction do not meet the requirement for hedge accounting hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting ha been discontinued change in the fair value of those transaction are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statement of income resulting in earnings volatility these change in fair value are reflected in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings and could be significant to neer result because the economic offset to the position are not marked to market consequence nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transaction for example gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivative is offset by decrease increase in the fair value of related physical asset position in the portfolio or contract which are not marked to market under gaap for this reason nee management view result expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedge meaningful measure of current period performance for additional information regarding derivative instrument see note overview and energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity accounting for pension benefitsnee sponsor qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employee of nee and it subsidiary management belief that based on actuarial assumption and the well funded status of the pension plan nee will not be required to make any cash contribution to the qualified pension plan in the near future the qualified pension plan ha fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefit under the plan nee allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to it subsidiary annually using specific criterion nature of accounting estimatesfor the pension plan the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the december measurement date of all benefit attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date the amount of benefit to be paid depends on number of future event incorporated into the pension benefit formula including an estimate of the average remaining life of employee survivor well the average year of service rendered the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumption concerning future interest rate and future employee compensation level nee derives pension income from actuarial calculation based on the plan provision and various management assumption including discount rate rate of increase in compensation level and expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption and accounting approachaccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet with change in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholder equity in the year in which the change occur since nee is the plan sponsor and it subsidiary do not have separate right to the plan asset or direct obligation to their employee this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiary the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gain and loss and prior service cost or credit that are estimated to be allocable to fpl net periodic income cost in future period and that otherwise would be recorded in aoci are classified regulatory asset and liability at nee in accordance with regulatory treatment of contentsnet periodic pension income is calculated using number of actuarial assumption those assumption for the year ended december and include salary expected long term rate of return net of investment management in developing these assumption nee evaluated input including other qualitative and quantitative factor from it actuary and consultant well information available in the marketplace in addition for the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset nee considered different model capital market return assumption and historical return for portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to it pension fund well it pension fund historical compounded return nee belief that is reasonable long term rate of return net of investment management fee on it pension plan asset nee will continue to evaluate all of it actuarial assumption including it expected rate of return at least annually and will adjust them appropriate nee utilizes in it determination of pension income market related valuation of plan asset this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period following the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return realized on those plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value of plan asset will be affected previously deferred gain or loss are recognized such gain and loss together with other difference between actual result and the estimate used in the actuarial valuation are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan asset the following table illustrates the effect on net periodic pension income of changing the critical actuarial assumption discussed above while holding all other assumption constant decrease in periodic pension income change inassumption nee fpl million expected long term rate of return discount salary nee also utilizes actuarial assumption about mortality to help estimate obligation of the pension plan nee ha adopted the latest revised mortality table and mortality improvement scale released by the society of actuary which not have material impact on the pension plan obligation see note carrying value of long lived assetsnee evaluates long lived asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable nature of accounting estimatesthe amount of future net cash flow the timing of the cash flow and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimate and judgment about future event in particular the aggregate amount of cash flow determines whether an impairment exists and the timing of the cash flow is critical in determining fair value because each assessment is based on the fact and circumstance associated with each long lived asset the effect of change in assumption can not be generalized assumption and accounting approachan impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow associated with that asset the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset fair value in most instance the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flow using an appropriate interest rate see note nonrecurring fair value measurement of contentsdecommissioning and dismantlementnee account for asset retirement obligation and conditional asset retirement obligation collectively aros under accounting guidance that requires liability for the fair value of an aro to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if it can be reasonably estimated with the offsetting associated asset retirement cost capitalized part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset nature of accounting estimatesthe calculation of the future cost of retiring long lived asset including nuclear decommissioning and plant dismantlement cost involves estimating the amount and timing of future expenditure and making judgment concerning whether or not such cost are considered legal obligation estimating the amount and timing of future expenditure includes among other thing making projection of when asset will be retired and ultimately decommissioned and cost will escalate with inflation in addition nee also make interest rate and rate of return projection on it investment in determining recommended funding requirement for nuclear decommissioning cost periodically nee is required to update these estimate and projection which can affect the annual expense amount recognized the
