is certified public accountant item risk factorsas previously discussed our actual result could differ materially from our forward looking statement factor that might cause or contribute to such difference include but are not limited to those discussed below these and many other factor described in this report could adversely affect our operation performance and financial condition if we can not continue to develop market and offer new product and service or enhancement to existing product and service that meet customer requirement our operating result could suffer the process of developing new high technology product and service and enhancing existing product and service is complex costly and uncertain if we fail to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technological trend our market share and result of operation could suffer we must make long term investment develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resource before knowing whether our prediction will accurately reflect customer demand for our product and service if we are unable to extend our core technology into new application and new platform and to anticipate or respond to technological change the market acceptance of our product and service could decline and our result would suffer additionally any delay in the development production marketing or offering of new product or service or enhancement to an existing product or service could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customer causing decline in our revenue earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position we maintain strategic relationship with third party to market certain of our product and service and support certain product functionality if we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationship with these third party our ability to compete in the marketplace to reach new customer and geography or to grow our revenue could be impaired and our operating result could suffer we offer our product on variety of personal computer tablet and mobile device recent trend have shown technological shift from personal computer to tablet and mobile device if we can not continue to adapt our product to tablet and mobile device our business could be harmed to the extent that consumer purchase of these device slow or to the extent that significant demand arises for our product or competitive product on other platform before we offer our product on those platform our business could be harmed release of new device or operating system may make it more difficult for our product to perform or may require significant cost in order for to adapt our solution to such device or operating system these potential cost and delay could harm our business introduction of new product service and business model by competitor or others could harm our competitive position and result of operation the market for our product and service are characterized by intense competition evolving industry standard emerging business and distribution model disruptive technology development short product and service life cycle price sensitivity on the part of customer and frequent new product introduction including alternative with limited functionality available at lower cost or free of charge any of these factor could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margin and could adversely affect our renewal and upgrade rate well our ability to attract new customer our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing product and service introduce new product and service on timely and cost effective basis meet changing customer need extend our core technology into new application and anticipate and respond to emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development such the evolution and emergence of digital application marketplace direct sale and software delivery environment these digital application marketplace often have exclusive distribution for certain platform which may make it more difficult for to compete in these market if any competing product service or operating system that do not support our solution achieve widespread acceptance our operating result could suffer in addition consolidation ha occurred among some of the competitor in the market in which we compete further consolidation in these market may subject to increased competitive pressure and may therefore harm our result of operation the introduction of certain technology may reduce the effectiveness of our product for example some of our product rely on third party cooky which are placed on individual browser when consumer visit website that contain advertisement we use these cooky to help our customer more effectively advertise to gauge the performance of their advertisement and to detect and prevent fraudulent activity consumer can block or delete cooky through their browser or ad blocking software of contentsor application the most common internet browser allow consumer to modify their browser setting to prevent cooky from accepted by their browser or are set to block third party cooky by default increased use of method software or application that block cooky could harm our business for additional information regarding our competition and the risk arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled competition contained in part item of this report if we fail to successfully manage transition to new business model and market our result of operation could suffer we often release new offering and employ new product and service delivery method in connection with our diversification into new business model and market it is uncertain whether these strategy will prove successful or whether we will be able to develop the necessary infrastructure and business model more quickly than our competitor market acceptance of new product and service offering will be dependent in part on our ability to include functionality and usability that address customer requirement and optimally price our product and service in light of marketplace condition our cost and customer demand new product and service offering may increase our risk of liability related to the provision of service and cause to incur significant technical legal or other cost for example with our cloud based service and subscription based licensing model such creative cloud we have entered market that may not be fully accustomed to cloud based subscription offering market acceptance of such service is affected by variety of factor including information security reliability performance customer preference social and community engagement local government regulation regarding online service and user generated content the sufficiency of technological infrastructure to support our product and service in certain geography customer concern with entrusting third party to store and manage it data consumer concern regarding data privacy and the enactment of law or regulation that restrict our ability to provide such service to customer in the united state or internationally if we are unable to respond to these threat our business could be harmed from time to time we open source certain of our technology initiative provide broader open access to our technology license certain of our technology on royalty free basis or release selected technology for industry standardization additionally customer requirement for open standard or open source product could impact adoption or use of some of our product or service to the extent we incorrectly predict customer requirement for such product or service or if there is delay in market acceptance of such product or service our business could be harmed we also devote significant resource to the development of technology and service offering in market where our operating history is le extensive such the marketplace for stock imagery these new offering and market may require considerable investment of technical financial compliance and sale resource and scalable organization some of our competitor may have advantage over due to their larger presence larger developer network deeper market experience and larger sale consulting and marketing resource in addition the metric we use to gauge the status of our business model transition may evolve over the course of the transition significant trend emerge if we are unable to successfully establish new offering in light of the competitive environment our result of operation could suffer subscription offering and etlas could create risk related to the timing of revenue recognition our subscription model creates certain risk related to the timing of revenue recognition and potential reduction in cash flow portion of the subscription based revenue we report each quarter result from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to subscription agreement entered into during previous quarter decline in new or renewed subscription in any period may not be immediately reflected in our reported financial result for that period but may result in decline in our revenue in future quarter if we were to experience significant downturn in subscription sale and renewal rate our reported financial result might not reflect such downturn until future period our subscription model could also make it difficult for to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription based or hosted service through additional sale in any period revenue from new customer will be recognized over the applicable subscription term further any increase in sale under our subscription sale model could result in decreased revenue over the short term if they are offset by decline in sale from perpetual license customer additionally in connection with our sale effort to enterprise customer and our use of etlas number of factor could affect our revenue including longer than expected sale and implementation cycle potential deferral of revenue due to multiple element revenue arrangement and alternate licensing arrangement if any of our assumption about revenue from our new business or our addition of subscription based model prove incorrect our actual result may vary materially from those anticipated estimated or projected uncertainty about current and future economic condition and other adverse change in general political condition in any of the major country in which we do business could adversely affect our operating result our business ha grown we have become increasingly subject to the risk arising from adverse change in economic and political condition both domestically and globally uncertainty about the effect of current and future economic and political of contentsconditions on our customer supplier and partner make it difficult for to forecast operating result and to make decision about future investment if economic growth in country where we do business slows customer may delay or reduce technology purchase advertising spending or marketing spending this could result in reduction in sale of our product and service longer sale cycle slower adoption of new technology and increased price competition our customer include government entity including the federal government and if spending cut impede the government ability to purchase our product and service our revenue could decline deterioration in economic condition in any of the country in which we do business could also cause slower or impaired collection on account receivable which may adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition financial institution credit crisis could impair credit availability and the financial stability of our customer including our distribution partner and channel disruption in the financial market may also have an effect on our derivative counterparties and could also impair our banking partner on which we rely for operating cash management any of these event would likely harm our business result of operation and financial condition political instability in or around any of the major country in which we do business would also likely harm our business result of operation and financial condition the increased emphasis on cloud strategy may give rise to risk that could harm our business over the past several year our business ha shifted away from pre packaged creative software to focus on subscription model that price and delivers our product and service in way that differs from the historical pricing and delivery method of our creative tool and document service product these change reflect significant shift from perpetual license sale and distribution of our software in favor of providing our customer the right to access certain of our software in hosted environment or use downloaded software for specified subscription period this cloud strategy requires continued investment in product development and cloud operation and may give rise to number of risk including the following if customer desire only perpetual license or to purchase or renew subscription for specific product rather than acquire the entire creative cloud offering our subscription sale may lag behind our expectation our cloud strategy may raise concern among our customer base including concern regarding change to pricing over time service availability information security of cloud solution and access to file while offline or subscription ha expired customer may turn to competitive or open source offering we may be unsuccessful in maintaining our target pricing new seat adoption and projected renewal rate or we may have to rely heavily on promotional rate to achieve target seat adoption which could reduce average revenue per user and we may incur cost at higher than forecasted rate we expand our cloud operation we may be unable to predict subscription renewal rate and the impact these rate may have on our future revenue and operating result the hosted business model we utilize in our adobe marketing cloud offering typically involves selling service on subscription basis pursuant to service agreement that are generally one to three year in length our individual creative cloud and document cloud subscription agreement are generally month to month or one year in length etlas for our digital medium product and service are generally three year in length and subscription agreement for other product and service may provide for shorter or longer term our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and some customer elect not to renew we can not provide assurance that our subscription will be renewed at the same or higher level of service for the same number of seat or license or for the same duration of time if at all moreover under certain circumstance some of our customer have the right to cancel their service agreement prior to the expiration of the term of their agreement we can not provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rate our customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including their level of satisfaction with our service our ability to continue to regularly add feature and functionality the reliability including uptime of our subscription service the price of our service the actual or perceived information security of our system and service the price of service offered by our competitor merger and acquisition affecting our customer base reduction in our customer spending level or decline in customer activity result of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial market if our customer do not renew their subscription for our service or if they renew on term le favorable to our revenue may decline our future growth is also affected by our ability to sell additional feature and service to our current customer which depends on number of factor including customer satisfaction with our product and service the level of innovation reflected of contentsin those additional feature the price of our offering and general economic condition if our effort to cross sell and upsell to our customer are unsuccessful the rate at which our business grows might decline security vulnerability in our product and system could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claim maintaining the security of our product computer and network is critical issue for and our customer security researcher criminal hacker and other third party regularly develop new technique to penetrate computer and network security measure and we have previously disclosed certain party have in the past managed to breach certain of our data security system and misused certain of our system and software in order to access our end user authentication and payment information in addition cyber attacker also develop and deploy virus worm and other malicious software program some of which may be specifically designed to attack our product system computer or network sophisticated hardware and operating system application that we produce or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture including bug and other problem that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair customer ability to operate or use our product the cost to prevent eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problem bug virus worm malicious software program and security vulnerability are significant and our effort to address these problem may not be successful and could result in interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential

inquiry or oversight or loss of customer confidence any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customer and thereby requiring time and resource to repair our brand these problem affect our product and service in particular because cyber attacker tend to focus their effort on the most popular offering such those with large user base and we expect them to continue to do so critical vulnerability may be identified in certain of our application these vulnerability could cause such application to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system which could result in liability to or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our product and service to customer we devote significant resource to address security vulnerability through engineering more secure product enhancing security and reliability feature in our product and system code hardening conducting rigorous penetration test deploying update to address security vulnerability and improving our incident response time but these security vulnerability can not be totally eliminated the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin and we may be unable to implement these measure quickly enough to prevent cyber attacker from gaining unauthorized access into our system and product despite our preventative effort actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and system may harm our reputation or lead to claim against and have in the past led to such claim and could lead some customer to seek to return product to stop using certain service to reduce or delay future purchase of product or service or to use competing product or service if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology system or if our system become out of date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customer require our business could be adversely affected customer may also adopt security measure designed to protect their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of new technology further if we or our customer are subject to future attack or our technology is utilized in third party attack it may be necessary for to take additional extraordinary measure and make additional expenditure to take appropriate responsive and preventative step any of these event could adversely affect our revenue or margin moreover delayed sale lower margin or lost customer resulting from the disruption of cyber attack or preventative measure could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation some of our line of business rely on or our third party service provider to host and deliver service and data and any interruption or delay in these hosted service security or privacy breach or failure in data collection could expose to liability and harm our business and reputation some of our line of business and service including our online store at adobe com creative cloud document cloud other hosted digital medium offering and our adobe marketing cloud solution rely on hardware and service hosted and controlled directly by or by our third party service provider we do not have redundancy for all of our system many of our critical application reside in only one of our data center

respectively we also completed other immaterial business acquisition during the fiscal year presented pro forma information ha not been presented for any of our fiscal and acquisition the impact to our consolidated financial statement wa not material see note of our note to consolidated financial statement for further information regarding these acquisition critical accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rule and regulation of the sec we make assumption judgment and estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our assumption judgment and estimate on historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition on regular basis we evaluate our assumption judgment and estimate we also discus our critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of the board of director we believe that the assumption judgment and estimate involved in the accounting for revenue recognition business combination goodwill impairment and income tax have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement these area are key component of our result of operation and are based on complex rule requiring to make judgment and estimate so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy historically our assumption judgment and estimate relative to our critical accounting policy have not differed materially from actual result revenue recognitionour revenue is derived from the licensing of subscription perpetual and time based software product associated software maintenance and support plan non software related hosted service consulting service training and technical support we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criterion have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists we have delivered the product or performed the service the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable determining whether and when some of these criterion have been satisfied often involves assumption and judgment that can have significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report we enter into multiple element revenue arrangement in which customer may purchase combination of software upgrade maintenance and support hosted service and consulting for our software and software related multiple element arrangement we must determine whether and when each element ha been delivered determine whether undelivered product or service are essential to the functionality of the delivered product and service determine the fair value of each undelivered element using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe and allocate the total price among the various element vsoe of fair value is used to allocate portion of the price to the undelivered element and the residual method is used to allocate the remaining portion to the delivered element absent vsoe revenue is deferred until the earlier of the point at which vsoe of fair value exists for any undelivered element or until all element of the arrangement have been delivered however if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period change in assumption or judgment or change to the element in software arrangement could cause material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in particular period of contentswe determine vsoe for each element based on historical stand alone sale to third party or from the stated renewal rate for the element contained in the initial arrangement in determining vsoe we require that substantial majority of the selling price for product or service fall within reasonably narrow pricing range we have established vsoe for our software maintenance and support service custom software development service consulting service and training when such service are sold optionally with software license for multiple element arrangement containing our non software service we must determine whether and when each element ha been delivered determine the fair value of each element using the selling price hierarchy of vsoe of selling price third party evidence tpe of selling price or best estimated selling price besp applicable and allocate the total price among the various element based on the relative selling price method for multiple element arrangement that contain both software and non software element we allocate revenue to software or software related element group and any non software element separately based on the selling price hierarchy we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vsoe of selling price if it exists or tpe of selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exist for deliverable we use besp once revenue is allocated to software or software related element group we recognize revenue in conformance with software revenue accounting guidance revenue is recognized when revenue recognition criterion are met for each element we are generally unable to establish vsoe or tpe for non software element and such we use besp besp is generally used for offering that are not typically sold on stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offering we determine besp for product or service by considering multiple factor including but not limited to major product grouping geography market condition competitive landscape internal cost gross margin objective and pricing practice pricing practice taken into consideration include historic contractually stated price volume discount where applicable and our price list we must estimate certain royalty revenue amount due to the timing of securing information from our customer while we believe we can make reliable estimate regarding these matter these estimate are inherently subjective accordingly our assumption and judgment regarding future product and service well our estimate of royalty revenue could differ from actual event thus materially impacting our financial position and result of operation product revenue is recognized when the above criterion are met we reduce the revenue recognized for estimated future return price protection and rebate at the time the related revenue is recorded in determining our estimate for return and in accordance with our internal policy regarding global channel inventory which is used to determine the level of product held by our distributor on which we have recognized revenue we rely upon historical data the estimated amount of product inventory in our distribution channel the rate at which our product sell through to the end user product plan and other factor our estimated provision for return can vary from what actually occurs product return may be more or le than what wa estimated the amount of inventory in the channel could be different than what is estimated our estimate of the rate of sell through for product in the channel could be different than what actually occurs there could be delay in the release of our product these factor and unanticipated change in the economic and industry environment could make our return estimate differ from actual return thus impacting our financial position and result of operation in the future actual return and price protection may exceed our estimate unsold product in the distribution channel are exposed to rapid change in consumer preference market condition or technological obsolescence due to new platform product update or competing product while we believe we can make reliable estimate regarding these matter these estimate are inherently subjective accordingly if our estimate change our return and price protection reserve would change which would impact the total net revenue we report we recognize revenue for hosted service that are based on committed number of transaction ratably beginning on the date the service are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term over usage fee and fee billed based on the actual number of transaction from which we capture data are billed in accordance with contract term these fee are incurred we record amount that have been invoiced in account receivable and in deferred revenue or revenue depending on whether the revenue recognition criterion have been met our consulting revenue is recognized on time and material basis and is measured monthly based on input measure such on hour incurred to date compared to total estimated hour to complete with consideration given to output measure such contract milestone when applicable business combinationswe allocate the purchase price of acquired company to the tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed assumed equity award well to in process research and development based upon their estimated fair value at the acquisition of contentsdate the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimate and assumption especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible asset deferred revenue obligation and equity assumed although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale subscription support agreement consulting contract and acquired developed technology and patent expected cost to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable product and estimated cash flow from the project when completed the acquired company trade name and trademark well assumption about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio and discount rate in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligation assumed the estimated fair value of the support obligation is determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin the estimated cost to fulfill the obligation are based on the historical cost related to fulfilling the obligation in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the equity award assumed the estimated fair value is determined utilizing modified binomial option pricing model which assumes employee exercise their stock option when the share price exceeds the strike price by certain dollar threshold if the acquired company ha significant historical data on their employee exercise behavior then this threshold is determined based upon the acquired company history otherwise our historical exercise experience is used to determine the exercise threshold zero coupon yield implied by treasury issuance implied volatility for our common stock and our historical forfeiture rate are other input to the binomial model unanticipated event and circumstance may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result goodwill impairmentwe complete our goodwill impairment test on an annual basis during the second quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if change in fact and circumstance indicate that an impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill we typically estimate future revenue consider market factor and estimate our future cash flow based on these key assumption judgment and estimate we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to it estimated fair value assumption judgment and estimate about future value are complex and often subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy or our internal forecast although we believe the assumption judgment and estimate we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate different assumption judgment and estimate could materially affect our reported financial result we completed our annual impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal and determined there wa no impairment the result of our annual impairment test indicate that the fair value of our reporting unit are significantly in excess of their carrying value accounting for income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumption judgment and estimate to determine our current provision for income tax and also our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance to be recorded against deferred tax asset our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax law our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcome of current and future audit conducted by foreign and domestic of contentstax authority we have established reserve for income tax to address potential exposure involving tax position that could be challenged by tax authority in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax return by the irs and other domestic and foreign tax authority including current examination by the irs of our fiscal and tax return we expect future examination to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practice well other matter we regularly ass the likelihood of outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax and have reserved for potential adjustment that may result from the current examination we believe such estimate to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examination could significantly impact the amount provided for income tax in our consolidated financial statement our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the value of deferred tax asset take into account prediction of the amount and category of future taxable income such income from operation or capital gain income actual operating result and the underlying amount and category of income in future year could render our current assumption judgment and estimate of recoverable net deferred tax inaccurate any of the assumption judgment and estimate mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligation to differ from our estimate thus materially impacting our financial position and result of operation we are united state based multinational company subject to tax in multiple and foreign tax jurisdiction significant portion of our foreign earnings for the current fiscal year were earned by our irish subsidiary in addition to providing for income tax on earnings from the united state we provide for income tax on the earnings of foreign subsidiary unless the subsidiary earnings are considered permanently reinvested outside the united state while we do not anticipate changing our intention regarding permanently reinvested earnings if certain foreign earnings previously treated permanently reinvested are repatriated the related tax liability may be reduced by any foreign income tax paid on these earnings our income tax expense ha differed from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to discrete item and to earnings considered permanently reinvested in foreign operation unanticipated change in our tax rate could affect our future result of operation our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by change in the tax rate in jurisdiction where our income is earned by change in or our interpretation of tax rule and regulation in the jurisdiction in which we do business by unanticipated decrease in the amount of earnings in country with low statutory tax rate or by change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability the united state country in the european union and other country where we do business have been considering change in relevant tax accounting and other law regulation and interpretation including change to tax law applicable to corporate multinationals such adobe these potential change could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in other cost to recent accounting pronouncement on november the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu no balance sheet classification of deferred tax requiring all deferred tax asset and liability and any related valuation allowance to be classified non current on the balance sheet the classification change for all deferred tax non current simplifies entity process it eliminates the need to separately identify the net current and net non current deferred tax asset or liability in each jurisdiction and allocate valuation allowance we elected to prospectively adopt the accounting standard in the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal prior period in our consolidated financial statement were not retrospectively adjusted recent accounting pronouncement not yet effectiveon may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised good or service to customer the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective and permit the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method in august the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer deferral of the effective date which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for period beginning after december to december with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date accordingly the updated standard is effective for in the first quarter of fiscal we have not yet selected transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure with the exception of the new revenue standard discussed above there have been no new accounting pronouncement not yet effective that have significance or potential significance to our

meaningful indicator of future business prospect shippable backlog is comprised of unfulfilled order excluding those associated with new product release those pending credit review and those not

we had unbilled deferred revenue backlog of approximately billion which ha been updated to include million of individual annual subscription which were not captured in the prior year due to current year enhancement to our management reporting system we expect that the amount of unbilled deferred revenue backlog will change from period to period due to certain factor including the timing and duration of large customer subscription saas and managed service agreement varying billing cycle of these agreement the timing of customer renewal the timing of when unbilled deferred revenue backlog is to be billed change in customer financial circumstance and foreign currency fluctuation additionally the unbilled deferred revenue backlog for multi year subscription agreement that are billed annually is typically higher at the beginning of the contract period lower prior to renewal and typically increase when the agreement is renewed accordingly fluctuation in unbilled deferred revenue

primarily due to the expiration of the federal research and development tax credit in december and stronger domestic profit for fiscal in december the united state congress passed the permanent

netting arrangement which have the ability to further limit credit related loss with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transaction sensitivity analysis wa performed on all of our foreign exchange derivative of november this sensitivity analysis measure the hypothetical market value resulting from shift in the value of exchange rate relative to the dollar for option contract the black scholes option pricing model wa used increase in the value of the dollar and corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instrument by million conversely decrease in the value of the dollar would result in decrease in the fair value of these financial instrument by million general rule we

reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flow will be adversely affected by change in exchange rate these foreign exchange contract carried at fair value may have maturity between one and twelve month we enter into these foreign exchange contract to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly they are not speculative in nature we record change in the intrinsic value of these cash flow hedge in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs when the forecasted transaction occurs we reclassify the related gain or loss on the

however if the only undelivered element is maintenance and support the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period change in assumption or judgment or change to the
