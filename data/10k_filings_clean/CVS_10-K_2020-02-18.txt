through the promulgation of executive order legislation regulation and guidance well ongoing litigation additional change to the aca and those regulation and guidance at the federal and or state level are likely and those change are likely to be significant growing federal and state budgetary pressure make it more likely that any change including change at the state level in response to change to or invalidation repeal or replacement of the aca and or change in the funding level and or payment mechanism of federally supported benefit program will be adverse to for example if any element of the aca are invalidated or repealed at the federal level the company expects that some state would seek to enact similar requirement such prohibiting pre existing condition exclusion prohibiting rescission of insurance coverage requiring coverage for dependent up to age requiring guaranteed renewability of insurance coverage and prohibiting lifetime limit on insurance coverage the expansion of health care coverage contemplated by the aca is being funded in part by reduction to the reimbursement the company and other health plan are paid by the federal government for medicare member among other source while not all inclusive the following are some of the key funding change related to the aca assuming it continues to be implemented in it current form that become effective on or after

the repeal of the annual non tax deductible industry wide hif for calendar year after the hif wa billion for and suspended for currently enacted the hif will be billion for the repeal of the non tax

to participate in certain product line and or geography that it serf today repeal of the aca ongoing legislative regulatory and administrative policy change to the aca the result of federal and state level election pending litigation challenging the constitutionality of the aca or funding for the law and federal budget negotiation continue to create uncertainty about the ultimate impact of the aca the time frame for conclusion and final outcome and ultimate impact of this litigation are uncertain given the inherent difficulty of foreseeing the nature and scope of future change to the aca and how state business and individual will respond to those change the company can not predict the impact on it of future change to the aca it is reasonably possible that invalidation repeal or replacement of or other change to the aca and or state response to such change in the aggregate could have significant adverse effect on the company business operating result and cash flow medicare

company success in achieving high star rating and other quality measure and the continuation of it improvement effort there can be no assurance that it will be successful in maintaining or improving it star rating in future year accordingly the company medicare advantage plan may not be eligible for full level quality bonus which could adversely affect the benefit such plan can offer reduce membership and or reduce profit margin overall the company project the benchmark payment rate in cm april final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rate for the final notice

face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medication and cm local and national coverage decision that require the company to pay for service and supply that are not factored into the company bid the federal government may seek to impose restriction on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider network for medicare advantage and or pdp plan or otherwise restrict the ability of these plan to alter benefit negotiate price or establish other term to improve affordability or maintain viability of product the company currently belief that the payment it ha received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the company continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp program although there are economic and political pressure to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change going forward the company expects cm the oig the doj other federal agency and the congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdp demonstration project such medicare medicaid plan and provider network access and adequacy modify the term and requirement of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurer role it is not possible to predict the outcome of this congressional or regulatory activity any of which could

business environment and gross margin in the industry in which we compete may decline each of our segment pharmacy service which includes our pharmacy benefit management pbm business retail ltc and health care benefit operates in highly competitive and evolving business environment specifically competition increase in the geography in which we operate including competition from new entrant significant increase in price compression and or reimbursement pressure could occur and this could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive the competitive success of our pharmacy service segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with network pharmacy pbm client evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network the competitive success of our retail ltc segment and our specialty pharmacy operation is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with pbms and other payors on acceptable term the payors client evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network in our pbm business we maintain contractual relationship with brand name drug manufacturer that provide for purchase discount and or rebate on drug dispensed by pharmacy in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacy all or portion of which may be passed on to client manufacturer rebate often depend on pbm ability to meet contractual requirement including the placement of manufacturer product on the pbm formulary if we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturer or if the discount or rebate provided by drug manufacturer decline our operating result cash flow and or prospect could be adversely affected the pbm industry ha been experiencing price compression result of competitive pressure and increased client demand for lower price increased revenue sharing including sharing in larger portion of rebate received from drug manufacturer enhanced service offering and or higher service level marketplace dynamic and regulatory change also have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsor pricing that includes the use of retail differential or spread which could adversely affect our future profitability and we expect these trend to continue our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operation have been affected by reimbursement pressure caused by competition including client demand for lower price generic drug pricing earlier than expected generic drug introduction and network reimbursement pressure if we are unable to increase our price to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing cost our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose customer to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and operating result shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate result of competition or otherwise could adversely affect our margin including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards day prescription at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription pbm client contract often are for period of approximately three year however pbm client may require early or periodic re negotiation of pricing prior to contract expiration pbm client are generally well informed can move between and our competitor and often seek competing bid prior to expiration of their contract we are therefore under pressure contain price increase despite being faced with increasing drug cost and increasing operating cost if we are unable to increase our price to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing cost our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose customer to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and operating result the operating result and margin of our ltc business are further affected by the increased effort of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangement and by the financial health of and purchase and sale of our ltc customer in our health care benefit segment we are seeking to substantially grow our medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan membership over the next several year in many instance to acquire and retain our government customer business we must bid against our competitor in highly competitive environment winning bid often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidder customer contract in our health care benefit segment are generally for period of one year and our customer have considerable flexibility in moving between and our competitor one of the key factor on which we compete for customer especially in uncertain economic environment is overall cost we are therefore under pressure to contain premium price increase despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit cost and increasing operating cost if we are unable to increase our price to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing cost our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose member to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and operating result in response to rising price our customer may elect to self insure or to reduce benefit in order to limit increase in their benefit cost alternatively our customer may purchase different type of product from that are le profitable such election may result in reduced membership in our more profitable insured product and or lower premium for our insured product which may adversely affect our revenue and operating result although such election also may reduce our health care and other benefit cost in addition our medicare medicaid and chip product are subject to termination without cause periodic re bid rate adjustment and program redesign customer seek to contain their benefit cost particularly in an uncertain economy and our exposure to this risk is increasing we grow our government product membership these action may adversely affect our membership revenue and operating result we requested significant increase in our premium rate in our commercial health care benefit business for including result of the reinstatement for of the health insurer fee the hif imposed by the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of collectively the aca following the temporary suspension of the hif for and expect to continue to request increase in those rate for and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trend required expansion of coverage and rating limit and significant assessment fee and tax imposed by the federal and state government including result of the aca our rate also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our product will be selected by people with higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participant we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable product also known adverse selection particularly in small group commercial product which we expect to continue and potentially worsen in these rate increase may be significant and thus heighten the risk of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increase will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression in addition competitor in each of our business may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer competition also may come from new entrant and other source in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our client through innovative product and service offering in the rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive disruptive innovation by existing or new competitor could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require to accurately identify and ass such alteration and make timely and effective change to our strategy and business model to compete effectively for example decision to buy our pharmacy service and health care benefit product and service increasingly are made or influenced by consumer either through direct purchasing for example medicare advantage plan and pdps or through public health insurance exchange public exchange and private health insurance exchange together with public exchange collectively insurance exchange that allow individual choice consumer also are increasingly seeking to access consumer good and health care product and service locally and through other direct channel such mobile device and website to compete effectively in the consumer driven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capability attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationship that respond to consumer need and preference in marketplace dynamic or the action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance and decision to exclude from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network could materially and adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and or prospect change in our health care benefit product mix may adversely affect our profit margin our insured health care benefit product that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc product historically smaller employer group have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefit product because such purchaser are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditure although over the last several year even relatively small employer have moved to asc product we also serve and expect to grow our business with government sponsored program including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bid and have lower profit margin than our commercial insured health care benefit product shift of enrollee from more profitable product to le profitable product could have material adverse effect on the health care benefit segment operating result negative public perception of the industry in which we operate or of our industry or our practice can adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and prospect our brand and reputation are two of our most important asset and the industry in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public from time to time negative publicity may come result of adverse medium coverage litigation against and other industry participant the ongoing public debate over drug pricing pbms government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing the future of the aca surprise medical bill governmental hearing and or investigation actual or perceived shortfall regarding our industry or our own product and or business practice including pbm operation drug pricing and insurance coverage determination and social medium and other medium relation activity negative publicity also may come from failure to meet customer expectation for consistent high quality and accessible care this risk may increase we continue to offer product and service that make greater use of data and our business model becomes more focused on delivering health care to consumer negative public perception and or publicity of our industry in general or of or our key vendor broker or product distribution network in particular can further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our operating result and our stock price by adversely affecting our brand and reputation adversely affecting our ability to market and sell our product and or service and or retain our existing customer and member requiring to change our product and or service reducing or restricting the revenue we can receive for our product and or service and or increasing or significantly changing the regulatory and legislative requirement with which we must comply we must maintain and improve our relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customer and increase the demand for our product and service including proprietary brand the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customer to frequent our retail store and online site and to purchase product in additional category and our proprietary brand failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preference and spending pattern and evolving demographic mix in the community we serve an inability to expand the product being purchased by our client and customer or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular category of product could adversely affect our relationship with our customer and client and the demand for our product and service and could result in excess inventory of product we offer our retail customer proprietary brand product that are available exclusively at our retail store and through our online retail site the sale of proprietary product subject to unique risk including potential product liability risk mandatory or voluntary product recall potential supply chain and distribution chain disruption for raw material and finished product our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property right and the right of applicable third party and other risk generally encountered by entity that source market and sell private label product we also face similar risk for the other product we sell in our retail operation including supply chain and distribution chain disruption risk any failure to adequately address some or all of these risk could have an adverse effect on our retail business operating result cash flow and or financial condition additionally an increase in the sale of our proprietary brand may adversely affect our sale of product owned by supplier and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationship our ability to locate qualified economically stable supplier who satisfy our requirement and to acquire sufficient product in timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other thing that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationship with broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operating result and erode customer loyalty we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in marketplace dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication many of which are made available by manufacturer to limited number of pharmacy so called limited distribution drug that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drug and penetration in certain treatment category any contraction of our base of patient or reduction in demand for the prescription we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business operating result and cash flow we face risk relating to the availability pricing and safety profile of prescription drug that we purchase and sell the profitability of our retail ltc and pharmacy service segment is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug product we dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacy and the retail pharmacy in our pbm network also dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug our revenue operating result and cash flow may decline if physician cease writing prescription for drug or the utilization of drug is reduced due to increased safety risk profile or regulatory restriction manufacturing or other supply issue certain product being withdrawn by their manufacturer or transitioned to over the counter product future fda ruling restricting the supply or increasing the cost of product the introduction of new and successful prescription drug or lower priced generic alternative to existing brand name product or inflation in the price of brand name drug in addition increased utilization of generic drug which normally yield higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drug ha resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payment to retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacy for generic drug causing reduction in our margin on sale of generic drug consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factor may enhance the ability of manufacturer to sustain or increase pricing of generic drug and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition cost any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition cost or to modify our activity to lessen the financial impact of such increased cost could have significant adverse effect on our operating result number of factor many of which are beyond our control contribute to rising health care and other benefit cost we may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit cost which could adversely affect our health care benefit segment operating result premium for our insured health care benefit product which comprised of our health care benefit revenue for are priced in advance based on our forecast of health care and other benefit cost during fixed premium period which is generally one year these forecast are typically developed several month before the fixed premium period begin are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trend and change in our member behavior and health care utilization pattern and require significant degree of judgment for example our revenue on medicare policy is based on bid submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increase in excess of our projection can not be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premium result our profit are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecast and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trend even relatively small difference between predicted and actual health care and other benefit cost percentage of premium revenue can result in significant adverse change in our operating result number of factor contribute to rising health care and other benefit cost including previously uninsured member entering the health care system change in member behavior and health care utilization pattern turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefit or other regulatory change change in the health status of our member the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristic advance in medical technology increase in the number and of prescription drug including specialty pharmacy drug and ultra high cost drug and therapy direct to consumer marketing by drug manufacturer the increasing influence of social medium on our member health care utilization and other behavior change in health care practice and general economic condition such inflation and employment level in addition government imposed limitation on medicare and medicaid reimbursement to health plan and provider have caused the private sector to bear greater share of increasing health care and other benefit cost over time and future amendment or repeal or replacement of the aca that increase the uninsured population may exacerbate this problem other factor that affect our health care and other benefit cost include change result of the aca change to the aca and other change in the regulatory environment the evolution toward consumer driven business model new technology influenza related health care cost which may be substantial and higher than we project cluster of high cost case epidemic or pandemic health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factor that are or may be beyond our control for example the influenza season had an earlier than average start and ha higher incidence of influenza than the influenza season and influenza related health care cost were higher than aetna projected in our health care benefit segment operating result and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit cost through underwriting criterion product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contract and medical management program our medical cost management program may not be successful and may have smaller impact on health care and benefit cost than we expect the factor described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit cost which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating result the reserve we hold for expected claim in our insured health care benefit product are based on estimate that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient if actual claim exceed our estimate our operating result could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future cost may be limited large portion of health care claim are not submitted to after the end of the quarter in which service are rendered by provider to our member our reported health care cost payable for any particular period reflect our estimate of the ultimate cost of such claim well claim that have been reported to but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebate payable under the aca the center for medicare medicaid service cm and the federal office of personnel management opm minimum medical loss ratio mlr rule and the amount payable by to and receivable by from the united state federal government under the aca remaining premium stabilization program our estimate of health care cost payable are based on number of factor including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also make use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimate and the accuracy of the estimate is highly sensitive to change in medical claim submission and processing pattern and or procedure turnover and other change in membership change in product mix change in the utilization of medical and or other covered service including prescription drug change in medical cost trend change in our medical management practice and the introduction of new benefit and product we estimate health care cost payable periodically and any resulting adjustment including premium deficiency reserve are reflected in current period operating result within benefit cost for example of december and we established premium deficiency reserve of million and million respectively related to medicaid product in the health care benefit segment worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rate or change in claim payment pattern from those that we assumed in estimating health care cost payable of december would cause these estimate to change in the near term and such change could be material furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trend or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claim or reported claim that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future health care cost and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating result these risk are particularly acute during and following period when utilization of medical and or other covered service and or medical cost trend are below recent historical level and in product where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risk are further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulation that limit our ability to price for our projected and or experienced increase in utilization and or medical cost trend our operating result are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geography we serve our business are affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geography we serve including various economic factor including inflation and change in consumer purchasing power preference and or spending pattern an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment could cause decline in drug utilization an in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm service well consumer demand for product sold in our retail store if our customer operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payment or obtain adequate financing our customer may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amount owed to any inability of our customer to pay for our product and service may adversely affect our business operating result and cash flow in addition both state and federal government sponsored payer result of budget deficit or spending reduction may suspend payment or seek to reduce their health care expenditure resulting in our customer delaying payment to or renegotiating their contract with further economic condition including interest rate fluctuation change in capital market condition and regulatory change may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable term our ability to secure suitable store location under acceptable term our ability to execute sale leaseback transaction under acceptable term and the value of our investment portfolio adverse change in the economy consumer confidence and economic condition could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plan and health plan design favoring co insurance over co payment member and other consumer may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future and or decrease our prescription volume in addition our health care benefit membership remains concentrated in certain geography and in certain industry unfavorable change in health care or other benefit cost or reimbursement rate or increased competition in those geographic area where our membership is concentrated could therefore have disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefit segment operating result our health care benefit membership ha been and may continue to be affected by workforce reduction by our customer due to adverse and or uncertain general economic condition especially in the geography and industry where our membership is concentrated result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefit membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenue and operating result may be disproportionately affected by adverse change affecting our customer we are exposed to risk relating to the solvency of other insurer we are subject to assessment under guaranty fund law existing in all state for obligation of insolvent insurance company including long term care insurer hmo aca co ops and other payors to policyholder and claimant for example in the first quarter of aetna recorded discounted estimated liability expense of million pretax for our estimated share of future assessment for long term care insurer penn treaty network america insurance company and one of it subsidiary guaranty fund are maintained by state insurance commissioner to protect policyholder and claimant in the event that an insurer hmo aca co op and or other payor becomes insolvent or is unable to meet it financial obligation these fund are usually financed by assessment against insurer regulated by state future assessment may have an adverse effect on our operating result and cash flow extreme event or the threat of extreme event could materially increase our health care including behavioral health cost nuclear biological or other attack whether result of war or terrorism other man made disaster natural disaster epidemic pandemic and other extreme event can affect the economy in general our industry and specifically in particular such extreme event or the threat of such extreme event could result in significant health care including behavioral health cost which also would be affected by the government action and the responsiveness of public health agency and other insurer such extreme event or the threat of such extreme event also could disrupt our supply chain and or our distribution chain for the product we sell in addition our employee and those of our vendor are concentrated in certain large metropolitan area which may be particularly exposed to these event such event could adversely affect our business operating result and cash flow and in the event of extreme circumstance our financial condition or viability particularly if our response to such event are le adequate than those of our competitor from change in public policy and other legal and regulatory riskswe are subject to potential change in public policy law and regulation including reform of the health care system which can adversely affect our business entitlement program reform if it occurs could have material adverse effect on our business operation and or operating result the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operation and operating result could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy change at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing and or importation and or increased regulation of pbms including change to the medicare or medicaid program including the block grant option outlined by cm on january or the regulatory environment for health care and related benefit including the aca change to law or regulation governing drug reimbursement and or pricing change to the law and regulation governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program change to law and or regulation governing drug manufacturer rebate change to law and or regulation governing reimbursement paid to pharmacist by and or reporting required by pbms change to immigration policy and or other public policy initiative it is not possible to predict whether or when any such change will occur or form any such change may take including through the use of presidential executive order other significant change to health care and related benefit system legislation or regulation well change with respect to tax and trade policy tariff and other government regulation affecting trade between the united state and other country also are possible and could adversely affect our business if we fail to respond adequately to such change including by implementing strategic and operational initiative or do not respond effectively our competitor our business operation and operating result may be materially adversely affected in addition to effort to amend repeal or replace the aca and related regulation we expect the federal and state government to continue to enact and seriously consider many broad based legislative and regulatory proposal that will or could materially impact various aspect of the health care and related benefit system and our business potential modification to the aca including change in enforcement and or funding that further destabilize the public exchange well significant change to medicaid funding including the block grant option outlined by cm on january could impact the number of american with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage further change to federal health care and related benefit law including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing law law governing pbms and or law governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program are probable we can not predict the effect if any that new health care and related benefit legislation future change to the aca or the implementation of or failure to implement the outstanding provision of aca may have on our pharmacy service retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and or health care benefit operation and or operating result the federal and many state government also are considering change in the interpretation enforcement and or application of existing program law and regulation including change to payment under and funding of medicare and medicaid program and increased regulation of pbms further change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to additional regulation of pbms including formulary management or other pbm service drug pricing or purchasing patent term extension and or purchase discount and or rebate arrangement with drug manufacturer also could reduce the discount or rebate we receive change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to claim processing and billing including our ability to use mac list and collect transmission fee also could adversely affect our profitability we can not predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulation or change to existing law or regulation or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operation or operating result which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matter it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy change that would fundamentally change the dynamic of one or more of the industry in which we compete example of such change include the federal or one or more state government fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special need plan program increasing it involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing and or importation changing the law and regulation governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program changing the tax treatment of health or related benefit or repealing or otherwise significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse change remains high due to state and federal budgetary pressure and our business and operating result could be materially and adversely affected by such change even if we correctly predict their occurrence for more information on these matter see government regulation included in item of this form we fail to comply with applicable law and regulation many of which are

cash flow and or financial condition or result in significant liability and negative publicity for see legal and regulatory proceeding in note commitment and contingency included in item of this for additional information our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing we offer new product and service and expand in business area beyond our historical core business of pharmacy service retail ltc and health care benefit historically we focused primarily on providing pharmacy service retail ltc and health care benefit product and service result of our transformation program and other innovation initiative we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new product and service such the home hemodialysis device we are developing which present different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the product and service that we historically have offered the increased volume of business in area beyond our historical core business and new product and service subject to litigation and regulatory risk that are different from the risk of providing pharmacy service retail ltc and health care benefit product and service and increase significantly our exposure to other risk we face unique regulatory and other challenge in our medicare and medicaid business we are seeking to substantially grow the medicare and medicaid membership in our health care benefit segment in and over the next several year we face unique regulatory and other challenge that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those business in april cm issued final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rate for the final notice overall we project the benchmark rate in the final notice will increase funding for our medicare advantage business excluding the impact of the hif by approximately percent in compared to this rate increase only partially offset the challenge we face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medication and cm local and national coverage decision that require to pay for service and supply that are not factored into our bid and creates continued pressure on our medicare advantage operating result we can not predict future medicare funding level the impact of future federal budget action or ensure that such change or action will not have an adverse effect on our medicare operating result the organic expansion of our medicare advantage and medicare part service area is subject to the ability of cm to process our request for service area expansion and our ability to build cost competitive provider network in the expanded service area that meet applicable network adequacy requirement cm decision on our request for service area expansion also may be affected adversely by compliance issue that arise each year in our medicare operation cm regularly audit our performance to determine our compliance with cm regulation and our contract with cm and to ass the quality of the service we provide to our medicare member result of these audit we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustment to and or withholding of certain premium and fee fine criminal liability civil monetary penalty cm imposed sanction including suspension or exclusion from participation in government program or other restriction on our medicare medicaid and other business including suspension or loss of licensure star rating from cm for our medicare advantage plan will continue to have significant effect on our plan operating result since only medicare advantage plan with star rating of four or higher out of five are eligible for quality bonus in their basic premium rate cm continues to change it rating system to make achieving and maintaining four or higher star rating more difficult our star rating and past performance score are adversely affected by the compliance issue that arise each year in our medicare operation if our star rating fall below for significant portion of our medicare advantage membership or do not match the performance of our competitor or the star rating quality bonus are reduced or eliminated our revenue operating result and cash flow may be significantly adversely affected payment we receive from cm for our medicare advantage and part business also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individual we enroll element of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the oig and cm itself substantial change in the risk adjustment mechanism including change that result from enforcement or audit action could materially affect the amount of our medicare reimbursement require to raise price or reduce the benefit we offer to medicare beneficiary and potentially limit our and the industry participation in the medicare program medicare part ha resulted in increased utilization of prescription medication and put pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rate due to regulatory and competitive pressure further result of the aca and change to the retiree drug subsidy rule client of our pbm business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible member to the extent this phenomenon occurs the adverse effect of increasing customer migration into medicare part may outweigh the benefit we realize from growth of our medicare part product our medicare part operating result and our ability to expand our medicare part business could be adversely affected if the cost and complexity of medicare part exceed management expectation or prevent effective program implementation or administration change to the regulation regarding how drug cost are reported for medicare part are implemented in manner that adversely affect the profitability of our medicare part business change to the applicable regulation impact our ability to retain fee from third party including network pharmacy the government alters medicare part program requirement or reduces funding because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayer of medicare part or for other reason the government mandate the use of point of sale manufacturer rebate or up front drug pricing discount make drug manufacturer rebate illegal or make change to how pharmacy pay for performance is calculated or reinsurance threshold are reduced below their current level we have experienced challenge in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our medicaid product due to difficulty with provider and third party vendor submitting claim in timely fashion in the proper format and with state agency in coordinating such submission state increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulty could affect the medicaid premium rate we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to which could have material adverse effect on our medicaid operating result and cash flow and or our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid program federal funding for expanded medicaid coverage began to decrease in this reduction is causing state to re evaluate funding for their medicaid expansion that re evaluation may adversely affect medicaid payment rate our medicaid membership in those state our revenue our mlrs and our operating result if we fail to report and correct error discovered through our own auditing procedure or during cm audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable law and regulation we could be subject to fine civil monetary penalty or other sanction including fine and penalty under the false claim act which could have material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage part or other government program and on our operating result cash flow and financial condition in the second quarter of cm issued final rule implementing aca requirement that medicare advantage and pdp plan report and refund to cm overpayment that those plan receive from cm however cm statement in formalized guidance regarding overpayment to medicare advantage plan appear to be inconsistent with cm prior risk adjustment data validation radv audit guidance these statement appear to equate each medicare advantage risk adjustment data error with an overpayment without reconciliation to the principle underlying the fee for service adjustment comparison contemplated by cm radv audit methodology the precise interpretation impact and legality of the final rule are not clear and are subject to pending litigation if medicare advantage plan were not paid based on payment model principle that align with the requirement of the social security act or such payment were not implemented correctly it could have material adverse effect on our operating result cash flow and or financial condition certain of our medicaid contract require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our medicaid program because more state are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standard and in part to set premium rate we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional cost to collect accurate or to inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanction and financial fine and penalty for noncompliance we have experienced challenge in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulty with provider and third party vendor submitting claim in timely fashion in the proper format and with state agency in coordinating such submission state increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulty could affect the medicaid premium rate we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to which could have material adverse effect on our medicaid operating result and cash flow and or our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid program our business that dispense drug also face challenge in the medicaid space the aca made several significant change to medicaid rebate and to reimbursement rate one of these change wa to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price pricing element common to most payment formula and the reimbursement formula for generic drug this change ha adversely affected the reimbursement we receive when we dispense prescription drug to medicaid recipient program funded in whole or in part by the federal government account for significant portion of our revenue and we expect that percentage to increase program funded in whole or in part by the federal government account for significant portion of our revenue and we expect that percentage to increase our government funded business grow our exposure to change in federal and state government policy with respect to and or regulation of the various government funded program in which we participate also increase our revenue from government funded program including in health care benefit medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan business and from government customer in it commercial business are dependent on annual funding by the federal government and or applicable state or local government federal state and local government have the right to cancel or not to renew their contract with on short notice without cause or if fund are not available funding for these program is dependent on many factor outside our control including general economic condition continuing government effort to contain health care cost and budgetary constraint at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issue and priority the federal government and our other government customer also may reduce funding for health care or other program cancel or decline to renew contract with or make change that adversely affect the number of person eligible for certain program the service provided to enrollee in such program our premium and our administrative and health care and other benefit cost any of which could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and cash flow when federal funding is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive and we remain liable for and are required to fund claim from provider for providing service to beneficiary of federally funded health benefit program in which we participate an extended federal government shutdown or delay by congress in raising the federal government debt ceiling also could lead to delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and significant increase in interest rate that could in turn have material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio our ability to access the capital market and our business operating result cash flow and liquidity possible change in industry pricing benchmark and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm and retail ltc business it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price awp or wholesale acquisition cost wac which are the pricing reference used for many of our pbm and ltc client contract drug purchase agreement retail network contract specialty payor agreement and other contract with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payment in addition many state medicaid fee for service program ffs medicaid have established pharmacy network payment on the basis of actual acquisition cost aac the use of an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practice in health care benefit commercial and other government product future change to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmark used to establish drug pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care program and or other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid program the reimbursement we receive from our pbm client and other payors and or our ability to negotiate rebate and or discount with drug manufacturer wholesaler pbms and retail pharmacy failure or inability to fully offset any increased price or cost or to modify our operation to mitigate the impact of such increase could have material adverse effect on our operating result additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection we can not predict the effect of these possible change on our business may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increase in our insured health care benefit product which would have an adverse effect on our revenue mbrs and operating result and could magnify the adverse impact of increase in health care and other benefit cost and of aca assessment fee and tax premium rate for our insured health care benefit product generally must be filed with state insurance regulator and are subject to their approval which creates risk for in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires review by hhs in conjunction with state regulator of premium rate increase that exceed federally specified threshold or lower state specific threshold set by state determined by hhs to have adequate process rate review can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margin medical benefit ratio mbrs and operating result of increase in health care and other benefit cost increased utilization of covered service and aca assessment fee and tax by restricting our ability to reflect these increase and or these assessment fee and tax in our pricing further our ability to reflect aca assessment fee and tax in our medicare medicaid and chip premium rate is limited since hhs ha issued determination to health plan that their premium rate increase were unreasonable and we continue to experience challenge to appropriate premium rate increase in certain state regulator or legislature in several state have implemented or are considering limit on premium rate increase either by enforcing existing legal requirement more stringently or proposing different regulatory standard regulator or legislature in several state also have conducted hearing on proposed premium rate increase which can result and in some instance have resulted in substantial delay in implementing proposed rate increase even if they ultimately are approved our plan can be excluded from participating in small group public exchange if they are deemed to have history of unreasonable rate increase any significant rate increase we may request heighten the risk of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increase will be denied reduced or delayed which could adversely affect our mbrs and lead to operating margin compression we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rate in our insured health care benefit product we may not be able to obtain rate that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policy profitable in one or more product line or geography if we are unable to obtain adequate premium rate and or premium rate increase it could materially and adversely affect our operating margin and mbrs and our ability to earn adequate return on insured health care benefit product in one or more state or cause to withdraw from certain geography and or product minimum mlr rebate requirement limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefit product while leaving exposed to higher than expected medical cost challenge to our minimum mlr rebate methodology and or report could adversely affect our operating result the aca minimum mlr rebate requirement limit the level of margin we can earn in health care benefit commercial insured and medicare insured business cm minimum mlr rebate regulation limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portion of our health care benefit medicaid and federal employee health benefit fehb program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirement in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirement leave exposed to medical cost that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebate payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirement are detailed federal and state auditor are challenging our commercial health care benefit business compliance with the aca minimum mlr requirement well our fehb plan compliance with opm fehb program specific minimum mlr requirement our medicare and medicaid contract also are subject to minimum mlr audit if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay minimum mlr rebate for three consecutive year it will become ineligible to enroll new member if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay such rebate for five consecutive year it will be terminated by cm additional challenge to our methodology and or report relating to minimum mlr and related rebate by federal and state regulator and private litigant are reasonably possible the outcome of these audit and additional challenge could adversely affect our operating result our operating result may be adversely affected by change in law and policy governing employer and by union organizing activity the federal and certain state legislature continue to consider and pas legislation that increase our cost of doing business including increased minimum wage and requiring employer to provide paid sick leave or paid family leave in addition our employee related operating cost may be increased by union organizing activity if we are unable to reflect these increased expense in our pricing or otherwise modify our operation to mitigate the effect of such increase our operating result will be adversely affected face international political legal and compliance operational regulatory economic and other risk that may be more significant than in our domestic operation we significantly expanded our international operation result of the aetna acquisition result of our expanded international operation we face political legal compliance operational regulatory economic and other risk that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operation these risk vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business condition and demand government intervention and censorship discriminatory regulation nationalization or expropriation of asset and pricing constraint our international product need to meet country specific customer and member preference well country specific legal requirement including those related to licensing data privacy data storage and data protection our international operation increase our exposure to and require to devote significant management resource to

corruption and anti money laundering law of the united state including the fcpa and the united kingdom including the uk bribery act and similar law in other jurisdiction implementing our compliance policy internal control and other system upon our expansion into new country and geography may require the investment of considerable management time and financial and other resource over several year before any significant revenue or profit are generated violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or employee restriction or outright prohibition on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm we must regularly reassess the size capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate change and must have effective change management process and internal control in place to address change in our business and operation our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate these risk and manage these difficulty and the failure to do so could have material adverse effect on our brand reputation business operating result and or financial condition our international operation require to overcome logistical and other challenge based on differing language culture legal and regulatory scheme and time zone our international operation encounter labor law standard and custom that can be difficult and make employee relationship le flexible than in our domestic operation and expensive to modify or terminate in some country we are required to or choose to operate with local business

exposed to currency exchange control or other restriction that prevent from transferring fund internationally or converting local currency into dollar or other currency fluctuation in foreign currency

these risk are heightened any measure we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currency and other risk on our international operation may not be effective risk associated with merger acquisition and divestiture risk relating to our acquisition of aetnawe expect to continue to incur significant non recurring cost associated with combining the operation of cv health and aetna we may not achieve the net benefit that we project of such expenditure associated with the elimination of duplicative cost the realization of other efficiency that we project related to the integration of our business or the realization of the growth opportunity that we project from the aetna acquisition in the near term or at all in addition the post closing integration of the operation of cv health

be complex and time consuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefit operating and cost synergy and or growth opportunity of an acquisition potential difficulty that may be encountered in the integration process include the following integrating personnel operation and system including internal control environment and compliance policy while

and future goal and objective there is no guarantee we will be able to attract and retain such employee or that competition among potential employer will not result in increased compensation and or benefit cost if we are unable to retain existing employee or attract additional employee or we experience an unexpected loss of leadership we could experience material adverse effect on our business operating result and or future performance in addition our failure to adequately plan for succession of senior management and other key management role or the failure of key employee to successfully transition into new role could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and or future performance the succession plan we have in place and our employment arrangement with certain key executive do not guarantee the service of these executive will continue to be available to sale of our product and service are dependent on our ability to attract and motivate internal sale personnel and independent third party broker consultant and agent new distribution channel create new disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalty or other regulatory action result of the marketing practice of broker and agent selling our product our product are sold primarily through our sale personnel who frequently work with independent broker consultant and agent who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent broker consultant and agent generally are not dedicated to exclusively and may frequently recommend and or market health care benefit product of our competitor accordingly we must compete intensely for their service and allegiance our sale could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sale personnel and third party broker consultant and agent or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to this sale network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sale strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channel this risk is heightened we develop operate and expand our consumer oriented product and service and we expand in the health care space and our business model evolves to include greater focus on consumer and direct to consumer sale such competing for sale on insurance exchange new distribution channel for our product and service continue to emerge including private exchange operated by health care consultant and technology company these channel may make it more difficult for to directly engage consumer and other customer in the selection and management of their health care benefit in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health care system we also may be challenged by new technology and marketplace entrant that could interfere with our existing relationship with customer and health plan member in these area in addition there have been several investigation regarding the marketing practice of broker and agent selling health care and other insurance product and the payment they receive these investigation have resulted in enforcement action against company in our industry and broker and agent marketing and selling those company product for example cm and state department of insurance have increased their scrutiny of the marketing practice of broker and agent who market medicare product these investigation and enforcement action could result in penalty and the imposition of corrective action plan and or change to industry practice which could adversely affect our ability to market our product of our business to effectively collaborate could prevent from maximizing our operating result to maximize our overall enterprise value our various business need to collaborate effectively our business need to be aligned in order to prioritize goal and coordinate the design of new product intended to utilize the offering of multiple business including our transformation and enterprise modernization program in addition misaligned incentive information siloes ineffective product development and failure of our corporate governance policy or procedure for example significant financial decision being made at an inappropriate level in our organization also could prevent from maximizing our operating result and or achieving our financial and other projection the failure or disruption

significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational process our business success and operating result depend in part on effective information technology system and on continuing to develop and implement improvement in technology pursuing multiple initiative simultaneously could make this continued development and implementation significantly more challenging many aspect of our operation are dependent on our information system and the information collected processed stored and handled by these system we rely heavily on our computer system to manage our ordering pricing point of sale pharmacy fulfillment inventory replenishment claim processing customer loyalty and subscription program finance and other process

information and other technology system supporting our business including result of our acquisition our business depend in large part on these system to adequately price our product and service accurately establish reserve process claim and report operating result and interact with provider employer plan sponsor customer member consumer and vendor in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trend toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technology including more sophisticated application for mobile device certain of our technology system including software are older legacy system that are le flexible le efficient and require significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resource to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other system we must re engineer and reduce the number of these system to meet changing consumer and vendor preference and need improve our productivity and reduce our operating expense we also need to develop or acquire new technology system contract with new vendor or modify certain of our existing system to support the consumer oriented and transformation product and service we are developing operating and expanding and or to meet current and developing industry and regulatory standard including to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risk and threat if we fail to achieve these objective our ability to profitably grow our business and or our operating result may be adversely affected in addition information technology and other technology and process improvement project including our transformation and enterprise modernization program frequently are long term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefit we project once they are complete if we do not effectively and efficiently secure manage integrate and enhance our technology portfolio including vendor sourced system we could among other thing have problem determining health care and other benefit cost estimate and or establishing appropriate pricing meeting the need of customer consumer provider member and vendor developing and expanding our consumer oriented product and service or keeping pace with industry and regulatory standard and our operating result may be adversely affected are subject to payment related risk that could increase our operating cost expose to fraud or theft subject to potential liability and disrupt our business operation we accept payment using variety of method including cash check credit card debit card gift card mobile payment and potentially other technology in the future acceptance of these payment method subject to rule regulation contractual obligation and compliance requirement including payment network rule and operating guideline data security standard and certification requirement and rule governing electronic fund transfer these requirement may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment option including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and various other form of electronic payment if these vendor are unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised our operation could be disrupted the payment method that we offer also expose to potential fraud and theft by person seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness in the payment system we use if we fail to abide by applicable rule or requirement or if data relating to our payment system is compromised due to breach or misuse we may be responsible for any cost incurred by payment card issuing bank and other third party or subject to fine and higher transaction fee in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain type of payment could each be harmed resulting in reduced sale and adverse effect on our operating result both our and our vendor operation are subject to variety of business continuity hazard and risk any of which could interrupt our operation or otherwise adversely affect our performance and operating result we and our vendor are subject to business continuity hazard and other risk including natural disaster utility and other mechanical failure act of war or terrorism disruption of communication data security and preservation disruption of supply or distribution safety regulation and labor difficulty the occurrence of any of these or other event to or our vendor might disrupt or shut our operation or otherwise adversely affect our operation we also may be subject to certain liability claim in the event of an injury or loss of life or damage to property resulting from such event although we have developed procedure for crisis management and disaster recovery and business continuity plan and maintain insurance policy that we believe are customary and adequate for our size and industry our insurance policy include limit and exclusion and result our coverage may be insufficient to protect against all potential hazard and risk incident to our business in addition our crisis management and disaster recovery procedure and business continuity plan may not be effective should any such hazard or risk occur or should our insurance coverage be inadequate or unavailable our business operating result cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected financial riskswe would be adversely affected if we do not effectively deploy our capital downgrade or potential downgrade in our credit rating should they occur could adversely affect our brand and reputation business operating result cash flow and financial condition our operation generate significant capital and we have the ability to raise additional capital the manner in which we deploy our capital including investment in our business our operation such information technology and other strategic and capital project dividend acquisition share and or debt repurchase repayment of debt reinsurance or other capital us impact our financial strength claim paying ability and credit rating issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organization credit rating issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organization are broadly distributed and generally used throughout our industry our rating reflect each rating organization opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligation or obligation to our insured we believe our credit rating and the financial strength and claim paying ability of our principal insurance and hmo subsidiary are important factor in marketing our health care benefit product to certain of our customer each of the rating organization review our rating periodically and there can be no assurance that our current rating will be maintained in the future in connection with the completion of the aetna acquisition each of standard poor moody and fitch downgraded certain of our debt financial strength and or other credit rating downgrade in our rating could adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and financial condition goodwill and other intangible asset could in the future become impaired of december we had billion of goodwill and other intangible asset during the year ended december we took billion of goodwill impairment charge related to our ltc reporting unit within the retail ltc segment and indefinitely lived intangible asset are subject to annual impairment review or more frequent review if event or circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to their respective carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow method and market multiple method if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance estimated fair value could change if for example there are change in the business climate industry wide change change in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory action or development change in capital structure cost of debt interest rate capital expenditure level operating cash flow or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset any future impairment of these asset could require material noncash charge to our operating result which also could have material adverse effect on our financial condition adverse condition in the and global capital market can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment in debt and equity security mortgage loan alternative investment and other investment and our operating result and or our financial condition the global capital market including credit market continue to experience volatility and uncertainty an insurer we have substantial investment portfolio that support our policy liability and surplus and is comprised largely of debt security of issuer located in the result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rate in the and to lesser extent the international financial market and volatility uncertainty and or disruption in the global capital market particularly the credit market and government monetary policy particularly monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our operating result and or our financial condition by significantly reducing the value and or liquidity of the debt security we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital loss that reduce our operating result and or unrealized capital loss that reduce our shareholder equity keeping interest rate low on high quality short term or medium term debt security such we have experienced during recent year and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating result the proceeds from security in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding security reducing the fair value of our investment if interest rate rise causing non performance of or default on their obligation to by third party including customer issuer of security in our investment portfolio mortgage borrower and or reinsurance and or derivative counterparties making it more difficult to value certain of our investment security for example if trading becomes le frequent which could lead to significant period to period change in our estimate of the fair value of those security and cause period to period volatility in our net income and shareholder equity reducing our ability to issue short term debt security at attractive interest rate thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our operating result and reducing our ability to issue other security although we seek within guideline we deem appropriate to match the duration of our asset and liability and to manage our credit and counterparty exposure failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstance our cash flow we have incurred and assumed significant indebtedness which ha increased our consolidated interest expense and could adversely affect our business flexibility and increase our borrowing cost in order to complete the aetna acquisition we incurred acquisition related debt financing of approximately billion and assumed aetna existing indebtedness with fair value of approximately billion our substantial indebtedness and elevated debt to equity ratio have the effect among other thing of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic condition and increasing our interest expense compared to pre aetna acquisition period in addition the amount of cash required to service our increased indebtedness level and thus the demand on our cash resource are greater than the amount of cash flow required to service our indebtedness prior to the aetna acquisition we have suspended share repurchase until we reach our desired debt to equity ratio the increased level of indebtedness also could reduce fund available to engage in investment in product development capital expenditure dividend payment and other activity and may create competitive disadvantage for relative to other company with lower debt level related to our relationship with manufacturer provider supplier and vendorswe face risk relating to the market availability pricing supplier and safety profile of prescription drug and other product that we purchase and sell our retail ltc segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operation generate revenue in significant part by dispensing prescription drug our pbm business generates revenue primarily by contracting with client to provide prescription drug and related health care service to plan member result we are dependent on our relationship with prescription drug manufacturer and supplier we acquire substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier certain of our agreement with such supplier are short term and cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may allow the supplier to distribute through channel other than certain of these agreement also allow pricing and other term to be adjusted periodically for changing market condition or required service level termination or modification to any of these relationship could adversely affect our prescription drug supply and have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition moreover many product distributed by our pharmacy are manufactured with ingredient that are susceptible to supply shortage in some case we depend upon single source of supply any such supply shortage or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our operating result and cash flow much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our pharmacy and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united state in most case the product or merchandise are imported by others and sold to result significant change in tax or trade policy tariff or trade relation between the united state and other country such the imposition of unilateral tariff on imported product could result in significant increase in our cost restrict our access to supplier depress economic activity and have material adverse effect on our business operating result and cash flow in addition other country may change their business and trade policy and such change well any negative sentiment towards the united state in response to increased import tariff and other change in trade regulation could adversely affect our business our supplier are independent entity subject to their own operational and financial risk that are outside our control if our current supplier were to stop selling prescription drug to or delay delivery including result of supply shortage supplier production disruption supplier quality issue closing or bankruptcy of our supplier or for other reason we may be unable to procure alternative from other supplier in timely and efficient manner and on acceptable term or at all our operating result may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with provider on competitive term and develop and maintain attractive network with high quality provider we are seeking to enhance our health care provider network by entering into joint venture and other collaborative risk sharing arrangement with health care provider provider willingness to enter these arrangement with depends upon among other thing our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these value based contract these arrangement are designed to give provider incentive to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our member these arrangement also may allow to expand into new geography target new customer group increase membership and reduce medical cost and if we provide technology or other service to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative source if such arrangement do not result in the lower medical cost that we project or if we fail to attract health care provider to such arrangement or are le successful at implementing such arrangement than our competitor our medical cost may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customer may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership and our ability to profitably grow our business and or our operating result may be adversely affected while we believe joint venture acos and other non traditional health care provider organizational structure present opportunity for the implementation of our joint venture and other non traditional structure strategy may not achieve the intended result which could adversely affect our operating result and cash flow among other thing joint venture require to maintain collaborative relationship with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rate that make the joint venture economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint venture we may not be able to achieve these objective in one or more of our joint venture which could adversely affect our operating result and cash flow our service provider fail to meet their contractual obligation to or to comply with applicable law or regulation we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation and or regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program we contract with various third party to perform certain function and service and provide with certain information technology system our arrangement with these third party may expose to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operation vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligation to or to comply with applicable law or regulation for example certain of our vendor have been responsible for release of sensitive information of our member and employee which ha caused to incur additional expense and given rise to regulatory action and litigation against these risk are particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program where third party perform pbm medical management and other member related service for any failure of our or these third party prevention detection or control system related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policy data security and or cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to member customer or other constituent sensitive information could require to expend significant resource to remediate any damage interrupt our operation and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceeding prohibition on marketing or active or passive enrollment of member corrective action fine sanction and or penalty any of which could adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and or financial condition we may experience increased medical and other benefit cost litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when provider that do not have contract with render service to our health care benefit member some provider that render service to our health care benefit member do not have contract with in those case we do not have pre established understanding with these provider to the amount of compensation that is due to them for service rendered to our member in some state the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating provider is defined by law or regulation but in most instance it is either not defined or it is established by standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar term in such instance provider may believe that they are underpaid for their service and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged from our member which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example in october an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospital approximately million in proceeding relating to aetna out of network benefit payment and administration practice and in march that award wa reduced to approximately million such dispute may cause to pay higher medical or other benefit cost than we projected continuing consolidation and integration among provider and other supplier may increase our medical and other covered benefit cost make it difficult for to compete in certain geography and create new competitor hospital and other provider and health system continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and ha the potential to improve the delivery of health care service it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting party in certain geography these health system also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plan to directly offer health insurance in competition with process that ha been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaid only acos developed result of state medicaid law practice management company consolidation among and by integrated health system and other change in the organizational structure that physician hospital and other health care provider adopt continues to change the way these provider interact with and the competitive landscape in which we operate these change may increase our medical and other covered benefit cost may affect the way we price our product and service and estimate our medical and other covered benefit cost and may require to change our operation including by withdrawing from certain geography where we do not have significant presence across our business or are unable to collaborate or contract with provider on acceptable term each of these change may adversely affect our business and operating result of contentsitem unresolved staff comment there are no unresolved sec staff comment item property the company principal office is

anticipated recovery of the debt security amortized cost basis the company analyzes all fact and circumstance believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis in accordance with applicable accounting guidance among the factor considered in evaluating whether decline in fair value is other than temporary are whether the decline result from change in the quality of the debt security itself whether the decline result from downward movement in the market whole and the prospect for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment current and short term prospect for recovery for unrealized loss determined to be the result of market condition for example increasing interest rate and volatility due to condition in the overall market or industry related event the company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the debt security prior to it

location basis and current physical inventory loss trend the total reserve for estimated inventory loss covered by this critical accounting policy wa million of december although management belief there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimate for estimated inventory loss it is possible that actual result could differ in order to help investor ass the aggregate risk if any associated with the inventory related uncertainty discussed above ten percent pre tax change in estimated inventory loss which is reasonably likely change would increase or

the long lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group future sale profitability and cash flow when preparing these estimate the company considers historical result and current operating trend and consolidated sale profitability and cash flow result and forecast these estimate can be affected by number of factor including general economic and regulatory condition effort of third party organization to reduce their prescription drug cost and or increased member co payment the continued effort of competitor to

identifiable asset acquired goodwill is subject to annual impairment review or more frequent review if event or circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable goodwill is tested for impairment on reporting unit basis the impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit fair value with it net book value or carrying amount including goodwill the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using combination of discounted cash flow method and market multiple method if the net book value carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds it fair value the reporting unit goodwill is considered to be impaired and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires the company to make significant assumption and estimate these assumption and estimate primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group company control premium and valuation multiple appropriate for acquisition in the industry in which the company competes discount rate terminal growth rate and forecast of revenue operating income depreciation and amortization income tax capital expenditure and future working capital requirement when determining these assumption and preparing these estimate the company considers each reporting unit historical result and current operating trend consolidated revenue profitability and cash flow result and forecast and industry trend the company estimate can be affected by number of factor including general economic and regulatory condition the risk free interest rate environment the company market capitalization effort of customer and payer to reduce cost including their prescription drug cost and or increase member co payment the continued effort of competitor to gain market share and consumer spending pattern goodwill impairment testduring the third quarter of the company performed it required annual impairment test of goodwill the result of this impairment test indicated that there wa no impairment of goodwill of the testing date the goodwill impairment test resulted in the fair value of all of the company reporting unit exceeding their carrying value by significant margin with the exception of the commercial business and ltc reporting unit which exceeded their carrying value by approximately and respectively of the aetna acquisition date the company added the health care benefit segment which included the commercial business reporting unit the transaction wa accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires among other thing the asset acquired and liability assumed to be recognized at their fair value at the date of acquisition result at the time of the acquisition the fair value of the commercial business reporting unit wa equal to it carrying value given the close proximity of the aetna acquisition date to the annual impairment test of goodwill expected the fair of the commercial business reporting unit remained relatively in line with the carrying value of the reporting unit in addition this fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumption including change in the revenue growth rate operating income and the discount rate although the company belief the financial projection used to determine the fair value of the ltc reporting unit in the third quarter of were reasonable and achievable the ltc reporting unit may continue to face challenge that may affect the company ability to grow the ltc reporting unit business at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test wa performed these challenge and some of the key assumption included in the company financial projection to determine the estimated fair value of the ltc reporting unit include client retention rate occupancy rate in skilled nursing facility the financial health of skilled nursing facility customer facility reimbursement pressure the company ability to execute it senior living initiative the company ability to make acquisition and integrate those business into it ltc operation in an orderly manner and the company ability to extract cost saving from labor productivity and other initiative the fair value of the ltc reporting unit also is dependent on market multiple of peer group company and the risk free interest rate environment which impact the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow valuation method if the company doe not achieve it forecast it is reasonably possible in the near term that the goodwill of the ltc reporting unit could be deemed to be impaired by material amount of december the remaining goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit wa million goodwill impairment testsas discussed in note goodwill and other intangible included in item of this during the ltc reporting unit continued to experience industry wide challenge that impacted management ability to grow the business at the rate that wa originally estimated when the company acquired omnicare and when the annual goodwill impairment test wa performed those challenge included lower client retention rate lower occupancy rate in skilled nursing facility the deteriorating financial health of numerous skilled nursing facility customer which resulted in number of customer bankruptcy in and continued facility reimbursement pressure in june ltc management submitted it initial budget for and updated the annual forecast which showed deterioration in the projected financial result for the remainder of and in which also caused management to update it long term forecast beyond based on these updated projection management determined that there were indicator that the ltc reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and accordingly management performed an interim goodwill impairment test of june the result of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit wa lower than the carrying value resulting in billion pre tax goodwill impairment charge in the second quarter of during the third quarter of the company performed it required annual impairment test of goodwill and concluded there wa no impairment of goodwill the goodwill impairment test showed that the fair value of the pharmacy service and retail pharmacy reporting unit exceeded their carrying value by significant margin and the fair value of the ltc reporting unit exceeded it carrying value by approximately during the fourth quarter of the ltc reporting unit missed it forecast primarily due to operational issue and customer liquidity issue including one significant customer bankruptcy additionally ltc management submitted an updated final budget for which showed significant additional deterioration in the projected financial result for compared to the analysis performed in the second and third quarter of primarily due to continued industry and operational challenge which also caused management to make further update to it long term forecast beyond based on these updated projection management determined that there were indicator that the ltc reporting unit goodwill may be further impaired and accordingly management performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of the result of that interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit wa lower than the carrying value resulting in an additional billion pre tax goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of in the fair value of the ltc reporting unit wa determined using combination of discounted cash flow method and market multiple method in addition to the lower financial projection change in risk free interest rate and lower market multiple of peer group company also contributed to the amount of the goodwill impairment charge goodwill impairment teststhe company recorded million in goodwill impairment charge in related to the rxcrossroads reporting unit during the third quarter of the company performed it required annual impairment test of goodwill the goodwill impairment test showed that the fair value of the pharmacy service and retail pharmacy reporting unit exceeded their carrying value by

indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable indefinite lived intangible asset are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to it carrying value if the carrying value of the asset exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to it estimated fair value the indefinite lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset the company would be willing to pay royalty in order to utilize the benefit of the asset fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payment to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset these estimate can be affected by number of factor including general economic condition availability of market information and the profitability of the company there were no impairment loss recognized on indefinite

previously estimated resulting in decrease of million in in health care cost payable that related to the prior year the company ha considered the pattern of change in it completion factor when determining the completion factor used in it estimate of ibnr of december however based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company estimated weighted average completion factor may vary by plus or minus basis point from the company assumed rate which could impact health care cost payable by approximately plus or minus million pretax also during the company observed that health care cost for claim with claim incurred date of three month or le before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated specifically after considering the claim paid in with claim incurred date for the fourth quarter of the previous year the company observed health care cost that were approximately lower than previously estimated during the fourth quarter of resulting in reduction of million in in health care cost payable that related to prior year management considers historical health care cost trend rate together with it knowledge of recent event that may impact current trend when developing estimate of current health care cost trend rate when establishing reserve of december the company increased it assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent three month by from health care cost trend rate recently observed however based on historical claim experience it is reasonably possible that the company estimated health care cost trend rate may vary by plus or minus from the assumed rate which could impact health care cost payable by plus or minus million pretax income taxesthe company account for income tax using the asset and liability

health care cost payablehealth care cost payable consist principally of unpaid fee for service medical dental and pharmacy claim capitation cost other amount due to health care provider pursuant to risk sharing arrangement related to the health care benefit segment insured commercial medicare and medicaid product and accrual for state assessment unpaid health care claim include an estimate of payment the company will make for service rendered to the company insured member but not yet reported to the company and ii claim which have been reported to the company but not yet paid each of the financial statement date collectively ibnr health care cost payable also include an estimate of the cost of service that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such service in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirement such estimate are developed using actuarial principle and assumption which consider among other thing historical and projected claim submission and processing pattern assumed and historical medical cost trend historical utilization of medical service claim inventory level change in insured membership and product mix seasonality and other relevant factor the company reflects change in these estimate in benefit cost in the company consolidated operating result in the period they are determined capitation cost represent contractual monthly fee paid to participating physician and other medical provider for providing medical care regardless of the volume of medical service provided to the insured member amount due under risk sharing arrangement are based on the term of the underlying contract with the provider and consider claim experience under the contract through the financial statement date the company develops it estimate of ibnr using actuarial principle and assumption that consider numerous factor of those factor the company considers the analysis of historical and projected claim payment pattern including claim submission and processing pattern and the assumed health care cost trend rate the year over year change in per member per month health care cost to be the most critical assumption in developing it ibnr estimate the company consistently applies these actuarial principle and assumption each period with consideration to the variability of related factor there have been no significant change to the methodology or assumption used to develop the company estimate of ibnr in the company analyzes historical claim payment pattern by comparing claim incurred date the date service were provided to claim payment date to estimate completion factor the company us completion factor predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claim incurred more than three month before the financial statement date the company estimate completion factor by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claim incurred for given month that are complete by each month thereafter for any given month substantially all claim are paid within six month of the date of service but it can take up to month or longer after the date of service before all of the claim are completely resolved and paid these historically derived completion factor are then applied to claim paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for given month incurred claim activity the difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claim paid through the financial statement date represents the company estimate of claim remaining to be paid of the financial statement date and is included in the company health care cost payable the completion factor the company us reflect judgment and possible adjustment based on data such claim inventory level claim submission and processing pattern and to lesser extent other factor such change in health care cost trend rate change in insured membership and change in product mix if claim are submitted or processed on faster slower pace than prior period the actual claim may be more le complete than originally estimated using the company completion factor which may result in reserve that are higher lower than the ultimate cost of claim because claim incurred within three month before the financial statement date are le mature the company us combination of historically derived completion factor and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claim incurred for these month the company applies it actuarial judgment and place greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred date these month may be influenced by seasonal pattern and change in membership and product mix company health care cost trend rate is affected by change in per member utilization of medical service well change in the unit cost of such service many factor influence the health care cost trend rate including the company ability to manage benefit cost through product design negotiation of favorable provider contract and medical management program well the mix of the company business the health status of the company insured member aging of the population and other demographic characteristic advance in medical technology and other factor continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit cost change in health care practice inflation new technology increase in the cost of prescription drug including specialty pharmacy drug direct to consumer marketing by pharmaceutical company cluster of high cost case claim intensity change in the regulatory environment health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factor also contribute to the cost of health care and the company health care cost trend rate for each reporting period the company us an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating it health care cost payable result considerable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimate particularly with respect to claim with claim incurred date of three month or le before the financial statement date and the adequacy of such estimate is highly sensitive to change in assumed completion factor and the assumed health care cost trend rate for each reporting period the company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care cost payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completion factor and health care cost trend rate well other factor the company belief it estimate of health care cost payable is reasonable and adequate to cover it obligation at december however actual claim payment may differ from the company estimate worsening or improvement of the company health care cost trend rate or change in completion factor from those that the company assumed in estimating health care cost payable at december would cause these estimate to change in the near term and such change could be material each quarter the company re examines previously established health care cost payable estimate based on actual claim payment for prior period and other change in fact and circumstance given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate it is possible that the company estimate of health care cost payable could develop either favorably that is it actual benefit cost for the period were le than estimated or unfavorably the change in the company estimate of health care cost payable may relate to prior quarter prior year or earlier period for roll forward of the company health care cost payable see note health care cost payable the company reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of it ultimate liability for health care cost payable other insurance liabilitiesunpaid claimsunpaid claim consist primarily of reserve associated with certain short duration group disability and term life insurance contract including an estimate for ibnr of the financial statement date reserve associated with certain short duration group disability and term life insurance contract are based upon the company estimate of the present value of future benefit which is based on assumed investment yield and assumption regarding mortality morbidity and recovery from the social security administration the company develops it estimate of ibnr using actuarial principle and assumption which consider among other thing contractual requirement claim incidence rate claim recovery rate seasonality and other relevant factor the company discount certain claim liability related to group long term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contract the discount rate generally reflect the company expected investment return for the investment supporting all incurral year of these liability the discount rate for retrospectively rated contract are set at contractually specified level the company estimate of unpaid claim are subject to change due to change in the underlying experience of the insurance contract change in investment yield or other factor and these change are recorded in current and future benefit in the consolidated statement of operation in the period they are determined the company estimate it reserve for claim ibnr for life product largely based on completion factor the completion factor used are based on the company historical experience and reflect judgment and possible adjustment based on data such claim inventory level claim payment pattern change in business volume and other factor if claim are submitted or processed on faster slower pace than historical period the actual claim may be more le complete than originally estimated using completion factor which may result in reserve that are higher lower than required to cover future life benefit payment there have been no significant change to the methodology or assumption used to develop the company estimate of unpaid claim ibnr in of

with gaap requires certain asset and liability to be reflected at their fair value and others to be reflected on another basis such an adjusted historical cost basis in this note the company provides detail on the fair value of financial asset and liability and how it determines those fair value the company present this information for those financial instrument that are measured at fair value for which the change in fair value impact net income loss attributable to cv health or other comprehensive income separately from other financial asset and liability instrument measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheetscertain of the company financial instrument are measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet the fair value of these instrument are based on valuation that include input that can be classified within one of three level of hierarchy established by gaap the following are the level of the hierarchy and brief description of the type of valuation information valuation input that qualifies financial asset or liability for each level level unadjusted quoted price for identical asset or liability in active market level valuation input other than level that are based on observable market data these include quoted price for similar asset in active market quoted price for identical asset in inactive market valuation input that are observable that are not price such interest rate and credit risk and valuation input that are derived from or corroborated by observable market level developed from unobservable data reflecting the company assumption financial asset and liability are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the valuation when quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability are available the company us these quoted market price to determine the fair value of financial asset and liability and classifies these asset and liability in level in other case where quoted market price for identical asset and liability in an active market is either not available or not observable the company estimate fair value using valuation methodology based on available and observable market information or by using matrix pricing model these financial asset and liability are classified in level if quoted market price are not available the company determines fair value using broker quote or an internal analysis of each investment financial performance and cash flow projection thus financial asset and liability may be classified in level even though there may be some significant input that may be observable the following is description of the valuation methodology used for the company financial asset and liability that are measured at fair value including the general classification of such asset and liability pursuant to the valuation hierarchy cash and cash equivalent the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent approximates fair value maturity are le than three month when quoted price are available in an active market cash equivalent are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy fair value of cash equivalent instrument that do not trade on regular basis in active market are classified level debt security where quoted price are available in an active market debt security are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy the company level debt security consist primarily of treasury security the fair value of the company level debt security are obtained using model such matrix pricing which use quoted market price of debt security with similar characteristic or discounted cash flow to estimate fair value the company review these price to ensure they are based on observable market input that include quoted price for similar asset in active market quoted price for identical asset in inactive market and input that are observable that are not price such interest rate and credit risk the company also review the methodology and the assumption used to calculate price from these observable input on quarterly basis the company selects sample of it level debt security price and compare them to price provided by secondary source variance over specified threshold are identified and reviewed to confirm the price provided by the primary source represents an appropriate estimate of fair value in addition the company internal investment team consistently compare the price obtained for select level debt security to the team own independent estimate of fair value for those security the company obtained one price for each of it level debt security and did not adjust any of those price at december or the company also value certain debt security using level input for level debt security fair value are determined by outside broker or in the case of certain private placement security are priced internally outside broker determine the value of these debt security through combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market flow the company did not have any broker quoted debt security at december the total fair value of broker quoted debt security at december wa million the company obtained one non binding broker quote for each of these level debt security and did not adjust any of those quote at december example of these broker quoted level debt security include certain and foreign corporate security and certain of the company commercial mortgage backed security well other asset backed security for some private placement security the company internal staff determines the value of these debt security by analyzing spread of corporate and sector index well interest spread of comparable public example of these private placement level debt security include certain and foreign security and certain tax exempt municipal security equity security the company currently ha two classification of equity security those that are publicly traded and those that are privately placed publicly traded equity security are classified in level because quoted price are available for these security in an active market for privately placed equity security there is no active market therefore these security are classified in level because the company price these security through an internal analysis of each investment financial statement and cash flow projection significant unobservable input consist of earnings and revenue multiple discount for lack of marketability and comparability adjustment an increase or decrease in any of these unobservable input would result in change in the fair value measurement which may be significant there were no financial liability measured at fair value on recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheet at december or financial
