management tprm process to screen for anti corruption global sanction human right and environmental risk engaging with supplier our tprm process also continuously monitor current supplier for policy violation and risk of contentsregulationthe fcc regulates many key aspect of our business including licensing construction the operation and use of our network modification of our network control and ownership of our license and authorization the sale transfer and acquisition of certain license domestic roaming arrangement and interconnection agreement pursuant to it authority under the communication act of amended communication act the fcc ha number of complex requirement that affect our operation and pending proceeding regarding additional or modified requirement that could increase our cost or diminish our revenue for example the fcc ha rule regarding provision of and service porting telephone number interconnection roaming internet openness or net neutrality disability access privacy and cybersecurity consumer protection and the universal service and lifeline program many of these and other issue are being considered in ongoing proceeding and we can not predict whether or how such action will affect our business financial condition or operating result our ability to provide service and generate revenue could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or change to existing law and regulation in addition regulation of company that offer competing service can impact our business indirectly except for operation in certain unlicensed frequency band wireless communication service provider generally must be licensed by the fcc to provide communication service at specified spectrum frequency within specified geographic area and must comply with the rule and policy governing the use of the spectrum adopted by the fcc the fcc issue each license for fixed period of time typically year depending on the particular license while the fcc ha generally renewed license given to operating company like the fcc ha authority both to revoke license for cause and to deny license renewal if renewal is not in the public interest furthermore we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty for failure to comply with fcc regulation even if any such noncompliance wa unintentional in extreme case penalty can include revocation of our license the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition in addition the fcc retains the right to modify rule related to use of licensed spectrum which could impact mobile ability to provide service additionally congress and the fcc allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service cmrs which includes cellular pc and other wireless service could significantly increase and intensify competition we can not ass the impact that any development that may occur in the economy or any future spectrum allocation by the fcc may have on license value fcc spectrum auction and other market development may adversely affect the market value of our license or our competitive position in the future significant decline in the value of our license could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition the fcc periodically review it policy on how to evaluate carrier spectrum holding change in these policy could affect spectrum resource and competition among and other carrier congress and the fcc have imposed limitation on foreign ownership of cmrs licensee that exceed direct ownership or indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee the fcc ha ruled that higher level of indirect foreign ownership even up to are presumptively consistent with the public interest but must be reviewed and approved consistent with that established policy the fcc ha issued declaratory ruling authorizing up to ownership of our company by dt for our educational broadband service eb license in the ghz band fcc rule previously limited eligibility to hold eb license to accredited educational institution and certain governmental religious and nonprofit entity while permitting those license holder to lease up to of their capacity for non educational purpose therefore we have historically accessed eb spectrum primarily through long term leasing arrangement with eb license holder our eb spectrum lease typically have an initial term equal to the remaining term of the eb license with an option to renew the lease for additional term for total lease term of up to year on april the fcc lifted the restriction on who can hold eb license and the year limitation on lease duration among other change the elimination of these restriction allows current license holder to sell their license including to mobile while majority of our lease have contractual provision enabling to match offer we may be forced to compete with others to purchase ghz license on the secondary market and expend additional capital earlier than we may have anticipated mobile ha started to acquire some of these eb license but we continue to lease spectrum in this band and expect that to be the case for some time while the communication act generally preempt state and local government from regulating the entry of or the rate charged by wireless communication service provider certain state and local government regulate other term and condition of wireless service including billing termination of service arrangement and the imposition of early termination fee advertising network outage the use of device while driving service mapping protection of consumer information zoning and land use notwithstanding this federal preemption several state are considering or have passed law or regulation of contentsthat could potentially set price minimum performance standard and or restriction on service discontinuation that could impact our business in those state in addition following the fcc adoption of the restoring internet freedom rif order reclassifying broadband internet access service non common carrier information service number of state have sought to impose state specific net neutrality rate setting and privacy requirement on provider broadband service the fcc rif order expressly preempted such state effort which are inconsistent with the fcc federal deregulatory approach in however the dc circuit issued ruling largely upholding the rif order but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state local measure regulating broadband service the court left open the prospect that particular state law could still unlawfully conflict with the fcc rif order and be preempted court challenge to some state enactment are pending while most state pursuing net neutrality legislation are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rule there are difference in some state notably california which ha passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation colorado connecticut utah and virginia which have passed privacy law and new york which ha passed broadband rate setting law there are also effort within congress to pas federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirement ensuring the preemption of separate state requirement including the california law is critical to this effort if not preempted or rescinded separate state requirement will impose significant business cost and could also result in increased litigation cost and enforcement risk state authority over wireless broadband service will remain unsettled final action by the court or congress in addition the federal trade commission ftc and other federal agency have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matter and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of non common carrier service further the fcc and the federal aviation administration regulate the siting lighting and construction of transmitter tower and antenna tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning well federal statute regarding environmental and historic preservation the future cost to comply with all relevant regulation are to some extent unknown and change to regulation or the applicability of regulation could result in higher operating and capital expense or reduced revenue in the future available informationthe sec maintains an internet site that contains report proxy and information statement and other information

factorsin addition to the other information contained in this form the following risk factor should be considered carefully in evaluating mobile our business financial condition liquidity or operating result well the price of our common stock and other security could be materially adversely affected by any of these risk risk related to our business and the wireless industry competition industry consolidation and change in the market for wireless communication service and other form of connectivity could negatively affect our ability to attract and retain customer and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we have multiple competitor that posse either more or different access to wireless asset and yet we compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network coverage speed and quality and customer service we expect the wireless industry customer growth rate to moderate over time in comparison with historical growth rate leading to ongoing competition for customer we also expect that our customer appetite for data service will place increasing demand on wireless service provider this competition and increasing demand for data service will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company including compete for relatively fixed pool of customer with an ever expanding variety of of contentsproducts and service our ability to compete will depend upon among other thing continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality capacity and customer service effective marketing and selling of product and service innovation and attractive pricing all of which will involve significant expense we face increased competition from other service provider in the connectivity sector from within and outside of the wireless industry including from cable fiber and satellite provider industry sector converge cable company such comcast charter and altice are diversifying outside cable voice and broadband service to also offer wireless service fiber company such lumen technology and windstream have announced plan for fiber buildouts often supported by government funding we expect dish which ha already acquired several mvnos to build wireless network and offer competitive postpaid and prepaid wireless service plan verizon and at have refocused on connectivity service including fiber build and deployment of next generation wireless technology and we expect both company to increase competitive pressure including by expanding partnership and offering these factor could make it more difficult for to continue to attract and retain customer by adversely affecting our competitive position and ability to grow including affecting our fixed wireless high speed internet growth plan which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we have seen and continue to expect additional joint venture merger acquisition and strategic alliance in the converged connectivity sector which could result in larger competitor competing for limited number of customer further consolidation could negatively impact our business including wholesale for example we have experienced and will continue to experience declining revenue from our wholesale business verizon migrates legacy tracfone customer off the mobile network and dish service more of it boost mobile customer with their standalone network our competitor may also enter into exclusive handset device or content arrangement execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaign or otherwise improve their cost position relative to making it more difficult for to compete and negatively impacting our business in addition refusal of our competitor and partner to provide critical access to resource and input such roaming and or backhaul service to on reasonable term could negatively impact our business we have experienced criminal cyberattacks and could in the future be further harmed by disruption data loss or other security breach whether directly or indirectly through third party our business involves the receipt storage and transmission of confidential information about our customer such sensitive personal account and payment card information confidential information about our employee and supplier and other sensitive information about our company such our business plan transaction financial information and intellectual property collectively confidential information we are subject to persistent cyberattacks and threat to our network system and supply chain from variety of bad actor many of whom attempt to gain access to and compromise confidential information by exploiting bug error misconfigurations or other vulnerability in our network and other system including purchased and third party system or by engaging in credential harvesting or social engineering in some case these bad actor may obtain unauthorized access to confidential information utilizing credential taken from our customer employee or third party other bad actor aim to cause serious operational disruption to our business or network through other mean such through ransomware or distributed denial of service attack cyberattacks company like ours have increased in frequency and potential harm over time and the method used to gain unauthorized access constantly evolve making it increasingly difficult to anticipate prevent and or detect incident successfully in every instance they are perpetrated by variety of group and person including state sponsored party malicious actor employee contractor or other unrelated third party some of these person reside in jurisdiction where law enforcement measure to address such attack are ineffective or unavailable and such attack may even be perpetrated by or at the behest of foreign government in addition we routinely provide certain confidential information to third party provider whose product and service are used in our business operation including part of our it system such cloud service these third party provider have experienced in the past and will continue to experience in the future cyberattacks that involve attempt to obtain unauthorized access to our confidential information and or to create operational disruption that could adversely affect our business and these provider also face other security challenge common to all party that collect and process information in august we disclosed that our system were subject to criminal cyberattack that compromised certain data of million of our current customer former customer and prospective customer including in some instance social security number name address date of birth and driver license identification number with the assistance of outside cybersecurity expert we located and closed the unauthorized access to our system and identified current former and prospective customer whose information wa impacted and notified them consistent with state and federal requirement we have incurred certain cyberattack related expense including cost to remediate the attack provide additional customer support and enhance of contentscustomer protection and expect to incur additional expense in future period resulting from the attack for more information see recent cyberattacks in the overview section of our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation result of the august cyberattack we are subject to numerous claim lawsuit and regulatory inquiry the ongoing cost of which may be material and we may be subject to further regulatory inquiry and private litigation for more information see contingency and litigation litigation and regulatory matter in note commitment and contingency of the note to the consolidated financial statement in january we disclosed that bad actor wa obtaining data through single application programming interface api without authorization based on our investigation to date the impacted api is only able to provide limited set of customer account data including name billing address email phone number date of birth mobile account number and information such the number of line on the account and plan feature the result from our investigation to date indicates that the bad actor obtained data from this api for approximately million current postpaid and prepaid customer account though many of these account not include the full data set we believe that the bad actor first retrieved data through the impacted api starting on or around november we continue to investigate the incident and have notified individual whose information wa impacted consistent with state and federal requirement result of the august cyberattack and the january cyberattack we may incur significant cost or experience other material financial impact which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limit of our cyber liability insurance and such cost and impact may have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flow and operating result in addition to the recent cyberattacks we have experienced other unrelated immaterial incident involving unauthorized access to certain confidential information typically these incident have involved attempt to commit fraud by taking control of customer phone line often by using compromised credential in other case the incident have involved unauthorized access to certain of our customer private information including credit card information financial data social security number or password and to certain of our intellectual property our procedure and safeguard to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information and to defend against cyberattacks seeking to disrupt our operation must be continually evaluated and enhanced to address the ever evolving threat landscape and changing cybersecurity regulation these preventative action require the investment of significant resource and management time and attention additionally we do not have control of the cybersecurity system breach prevention and response protocol of our third party provider while mobile may have contractual right to ass the effectiveness of many of our provider system and protocol we do not have the mean to know or ass the effectiveness of all of our provider system and control at all time we can not provide any assurance that action taken by or our third party provider will adequately repel significant cyberattack or prevent or substantially mitigate the impact of cybersecurity breach or misuse of confidential information unauthorized access to our network or system or exploit against third party environment or that we or our third party provider will be able to effectively identify investigate and remediate such incident in timely manner or at all we expect to continue to be the target of cyberattacks given the nature of our business and we expect the same with respect to our third party provider if we fail to protect confidential information or to prevent operational disruption from future cyberattacks there may be material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition cash flow and operating result if we are unable to take advantage of technological development on timely basis we may experience decline in demand for our service or face challenge in implementing or evolving our business strategy significant technological change continue to impact our industry in order to grow and remain competitive we will need to adapt to change in available technology continually invest in our network increase network capacity enhance our existing offering and introduce new offering to meet our current and potential customer changing service demand enhancing our network including the ongoing deployment of our network is subject to risk related to equipment change and the migration of customer from older technology negative public perception of and regulation regarding the perceived health risk relating to network could undermine market acceptance of our service adopting new and sophisticated technology may result in implementation issue such scheduling and supplier delay unexpected or increased cost technological constraint regulatory permitting issue customer dissatisfaction and other issue that could cause delay in launching new technological capability which in turn could result in significant cost or reduce the anticipated benefit of the upgrade if our new service fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if cost associated with these service are higher than anticipated this could have material adverse effect on our business brand financial condition and operating result of contentswe rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all level of our business our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture the market for highly skilled worker and leader is extremely competitive we believe our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit hire motivate develop and retain talented personnel for all area of our organization including our ceo and the other member of our senior leadership team may be difficult due to many factor including fluctuation in economic and industry condition change to immigration policy competitor hiring and remote working policy and practice employee intolerance for the significant change within and demand on our company and our industry and the effectiveness of our compensation program if key employee depart or we are unable to recruit successfully our business could be negatively impacted further inflationary cost pressure may increase our cost including employee compensation and lead to increased employee attrition to the extent our compensation doe not keep up with inflation particularly if our competitor compensation doe in addition certain member of our senior leadership team including our ceo have term employment agreement with our inability to extend the term of these employment agreement or to replace these member of our senior leadership team at the end of their term with qualified and capable successor could hinder our strategic planning and execution in addition the new hybrid work model introduced during the global covid pandemic the pandemic required mobile to change and evolve our company culture our culture continues to evolve we may experience adverse impact on our ability to attract retain and motivate key personnel existing and prospective employee may experience uncertainty about their future role with if key employee depart our business could be negatively impacted we may incur significant cost in identifying hiring and replacing employee and we may lose significant expertise and talent result we may not be able to meet our business plan and our business financial condition and operating result may be materially adversely affected system failure and business disruption may prevent from providing reliable service which could materially adversely affect our reputation and financial condition we rely upon system and network those of third party supplier and other provider in addition to our to provide and support our service offering system network or infrastructure failure resulting from number of cause may prevent from providing reliable service example of these risk include physical damage power surge or outage equipment failure or other service disruption with respect to both our wireless and wireline network including those resulting from severe weather storm and natural disaster which may occur more frequently or with greater intensity result of global climate change public health crisis terrorist attack political instability and volatility and act of war chronic change in physical condition such sea level rise or change in temperature or precipitation pattern which may impact the operating condition of our infrastructure or other infrastructure we rely on human error such responding to deceptive communication or unintentionally executing malicious code unauthorized access to our it and business system or to our network and critical infrastructure and those of our supplier and other provider supplier failure or delay and system failure or outage of our business system or communication network such event could cause to lose customer and revenue incur expense suffer reputational damage and subject to fine penalty adverse action or judgment litigation or governmental investigation remediation cost could include liability for information loss cost of repairing infrastructure and system and or cost of incentive offered to customer our insurance may not cover or may not be adequate to fully reimburse for cost and loss associated with such event and such event may also impact the availability of insurance at cost and other term we find acceptable for future event the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulation relating to spectrum use may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we continue to deploy spectrum to expand and deepen our coverage maintain our quality of service meet increasing customer demand and deploy new technology in order to expand and differentiate from our competitor we will continue to actively seek to make additional investment in spectrum which could be significant of contentsthe continued interest in and acquisition of spectrum by existing carrier and others including speculator may reduce our ability to acquire and or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market including leasing or purchasing additional spectrum in the ghz band or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other mean including government auction additionally increased interest from third party in acquiring spectrum may make it difficult to renew lease of some of our existing ghz spectrum holding in the future additionally the fcc may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum necessary to maintain or enhance our competitive position in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market on favorable term or at all any return on our investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customer and to provide additional service and usage to existing customer the fcc or other government entity may impose condition on the acquisition and use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area if we can not acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise if competitor acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide service competitive with our service or if we can not deploy service over acquired spectrum on timely basis without burdensome condition at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality level our ability to attract and retain customer and our business financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected we are modernizing our billing system architecture for our customer part of this strategy we are converting sprint legacy customer onto mobile billing platform result we will operate and maintain multiple billing system until such conversion is completed any unanticipated difficulty disruption or significant delay in either of these effort could have adverse operational financial and reputational effect on our business we are currently operating and maintaining multiple billing system and supporting platform we expect to continue to do so until successful conversion of sprint legacy customer to mobile existing billing platform we may encounter unanticipated difficulty or experience delay in the ongoing integration effort with respect to billing causing major system or business disruption in addition we or our supporting vendor may experience error cyber attack or other operational disruption that could negatively impact and over which we may have limited control interruption and or failure of these billing system could disrupt our operation and impact our ability to provide or bill for our service retain customer attract new customer or negatively impact overall customer experience any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effect on our operation and financial condition and or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage the challenge in satisfying the large number of government commitment in the required time frame and the significant cumulative cost incurred in tracking monitoring and complying with them over multiple year could continue to adversely impact our business financial condition and operating result in connection with the regulatory proceeding and approval required to close the transaction we agreed to fulfill various government commitment these government commitment include among other thing extensive network build commitment obligation to deliver high speed wireless service to the vast majority of american and marketing our in home fixed wireless product to household where spectrum capacity is sufficient other government commitment relate to national security pricing and availability of rate plan employment substantial monetary contribution to support several different organization and implementation of diversity equity and inclusion initiative most government commitment have specified time frame for compliance and reporting and we continue to focus on taking the action required to fulfill them any failure to fulfill our obligation under these government commitment in timely manner could result in substantial fine penalty or other legal and administrative action and or reputational harm we expect to continue incurring significant cost expense and fee to track monitor comply with and fulfill our obligation under these government commitment over number of year in addition abiding by the government commitment may divert our management time and energy away from other business operation and could force to make business decision we would not otherwise make and forego taking action that might be beneficial to the company the challenge in continuing to satisfy the large number of government commitment in the required time frame and the cost incurred in tracking monitoring and complying with them could also adversely impact our business financial condition and operating result and hinder our ability to effectively compete of contentseconomic political and market condition may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result our business financial condition and operating result are sensitive to change in general economic condition including interest rate consumer credit condition consumer debt level consumer confidence unemployment rate economic growth energy cost rate of inflation or concern about deflation supply chain disruption impact of current geopolitical instability caused by the war in ukraine and other macro economic factor the wireless industry broadly is dependent on population growth result we expect the wireless industry customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rate leading to ongoing competition for customer in addition the government commitment place certain limitation on our ability to increase price which limit our ability to pas along growing cost to customer rising price for good service and labor due to inflation could adversely impact our margin and or growth our service and device financing plan are available to broad customer base significant segment of which may be vulnerable to weak economic condition particularly our subprime customer we may have greater difficulty in gaining new customer within this segment and existing customer may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plan due to an inability to pay weak economic and credit condition may also adversely impact our supplier dealer and wholesale partner or mvnos some of which may file for bankruptcy or may experience cash flow or liquidity problem or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that they may no longer be able to operate any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute market or sell our product and service our business may be adversely impacted if we are not able to successfully manage the ongoing commercial and transition service arrangement entered into in connection with the prepaid transaction and known or unknown liability arising in connection therewith in connection with the closing of the prepaid transaction we and dish entered into certain commercial and transition service arrangement including master network service agreement the mnsa and license purchase agreement the dish license purchase agreement pursuant to the mnsa dish will receive network service from the company for period of seven year set forth in the mnsa the company will provide dish among other thing legacy network service for certain boost mobile prepaid end user on the sprint network mobile network service for certain end user that have been migrated to the mobile network or provisioned on the mobile network by or on behalf of dish and infrastructure mobile network operator service to assist in the access and integration of the dish network pursuant to the dish license purchase agreement dish ha agreed to purchase all of sprint mhz spectrum approximately mhz of nationwide spectrum for total of approximately billion in transaction to be completed subject to certain additional closing condition following an application for fcc approval to be filed three year following the closing of the merger provided however that if dish breach the dish license purchase agreement prior to the closing or fails to deliver the purchase price following the satisfaction or waiver of all closing condition dish sole liability will be to pay fee of approximately million in such instance mobile is required unless otherwise approved under the consent decree to conduct an auction of all of sprint mhz spectrum under the term set forth in the consent decree but would not be required to divest such spectrum for an amount le than billion the party are required to file an application for the transfer by april the covered spectrum sale must occur within the later of three year after the closing of the prepaid transaction and five day after receipt of the approval from the fcc of the application failure to successfully manage these ongoing commercial and transition service arrangement entered into in connection with the prepaid transaction and liability arising in connection therewith may result in material unanticipated problem including diversion of management time and energy significant expense and liability there may also be other potential adverse consequence and unforeseen increased expense or liability associated with the prepaid transaction the occurrence of which could materially impact our business financial condition liquidity and operating result in addition there may be an increase in competition from dish and other third party that dish may enter into commercial agreement with who are significantly larger and with greater resource and scale advantage compared to such increased competition may result in our loss of customer and other business relationship any acquisition divestiture investment or merger may subject to significant risk any of which may harm our business we may pursue acquisition of investment in or merger with other company or the acquisition of technology service product or other asset that we believe would complement or expand our business we may also elect to divest some of our of contentsassets to third party some of these potential transaction could be significant relative to the size of our business and operation any such transaction would involve number of risk and could present financial managerial and operational challenge including diversion of management attention from running our existing business increased cost to integrate the network spectrum technology personnel customer base and business practice of the company involved in any such transaction with our business difficulty in effectively integrating the financial and operational system of the business involved in any such transaction into or supplanting such system with our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner potential exposure to material liability not discovered in the due diligence process or result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction significant transaction related expense in connection with any such transaction whether consummated or not risk related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approval necessary to consummate any such transaction and any business technology service or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under perform relative to our expectation and we may not achieve the benefit we expect from the transaction which could among other thing also result in write of goodwill and other intangible asset associated with such transaction for any or all of these reason well unknown risk acquisition divestiture investment or merger may have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we rely on third party to provide product and service for the operation of our business and the failure or inability of such party to provide these product or service could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we have diverse set of supplier to help develop maintain and troubleshoot product and service such wireless and wireline network component software development service and billing and customer service support however in certain area such billing service voice and data communication transport service wireless or wireline network infrastructure equipment handset other device back office process and payment processing there are limited number of supplier who can provide adequate support for which decrease our flexibility to switch to alternative third party unexpected termination of our arrangement with any of these supplier or difficulty in renewing our commercial arrangement with them could have material and adverse effect on our business operation our supplier are also subject to their own risk including but not limited to economic financial and credit condition labor force disruption geopolitical tension disruption in global supply chain and the risk of natural catastrophic event such earthquake flood hurricane and public health crisis such the pandemic which may result in performance below the level required by their contract our business could be severely disrupted if critical supplier or service provider fail to comply with their contract or if we experience delay or service degradation during any transition to new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied product or service with those from another source especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice any such disruption could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result further some of our supplier may provide service from outside of the united state which carry additional regulatory and legal obligation we rely on supplier to provide with contractual assurance and to disclose accurate information regarding risk associated with their provision of product or service in accordance with our policy and standard including our supplier code of conduct and our third party risk management practice the failure of our supplier to comply with our expectation and policy could expose to additional legal and litigation risk and lead to unexpected contract termination we may not fully realize the synergy benefit from the transaction in the expected time frame our ability to realize the expected benefit from the merger will depend on our ability to integrate the two business in manner that facilitates growth opportunity and achieves the projected cost saving although we have completed number of integration activity we continue the process and may incur additional expense result of challenge in combining operation such of content difficulty in integrating operation and system including intellectual property and communication system administrative and information technology infrastructure and supplier and vendor arrangement difficulty in operating and maintaining multiple billing and related support system until conversion is completed difficulty in managing the expanded operation of significantly larger and more complex company compliance with government commitment relating to national security and other potential adverse consequence and unforeseen increased expense or liability associated with the transaction risk related to our indebtednessour substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business flexibility ability to service our debt and increase our borrowing cost we have and we expect that we will continue to have substantial amount of debt our substantial level of indebtedness could have the effect of among other thing reducing our flexibility in responding to changing business economic market and industry condition and increasing the amount of cash required to service our debt in addition this level of indebtedness may also reduce fund available for capital expenditure any board approved share repurchase and other activity those impact may put at competitive disadvantage relative to other company with lower debt level further we may need to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restriction contained in our debt instrument if any which could increase the risk associated with our capital structure our ability to service our substantial debt obligation will depend on future performance which will be affected by business economic market and industry condition and other factor including our ability to achieve the expected benefit of the transaction there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligation when due if we are unable to meet such obligation or fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenant contained in the agreement governing such debt obligation we may be required to refinance all or part of our debt sell important strategic asset at unfavorable price or make additional borrowing we may not be able to at any given time refinance our debt sell asset or make additional borrowing on commercially reasonable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result change in credit market condition could adversely affect our ability to raise debt favorably instability in the global financial market inflation policy of various governmental and regulatory agency including change in monetary policy and interest rate and other general economic condition could lead to volatility in the credit and equity market this volatility could limit our access to the capital market leading to higher borrowing cost or in some case the inability to obtain financing on term that are acceptable to or at all in addition any hedging agreement we may enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation may not offer complete protection from these risk or may be unsuccessful and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to any debt we may incur in foreign currency and any portion not subject to such hedging agreement would have full exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation applicable if any financial institution that are party to our hedging agreement were to default on their payment obligation to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent we would be unhedged against the underlying exposure any posting of collateral by under our hedging agreement and

financial reporting then our ability to analyze record and report financial information free of material misstatement to prepare financial statement within the time period specified by the rule and form of the sec and otherwise to comply with the requirement of section of the sarbanes oxley act would be negatively impacted result we may experience negative impact to our business financial condition or operating result which would restrict our ability to access the capital market require the expenditure of significant resource to correct the weakness or deficiency subject to fine penalty investigation or judgment harm our reputation or otherwise cause decline in trading price of our stock and investor confidence change in regulation or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal state and local agency well judicial review and action on issue related to the wireless industry that include but are not limited to roaming interconnection spectrum allocation and licensing facility siting pole attachment intercarrier compensation universal service fund service consumer protection consumer privacy and cybersecurity we are also subject to regulation in connection with other aspect of our business including device financing and insurance activity the fcc regulates the licensing construction modification operation ownership sale and interconnection of wireless communication system do some state and local regulatory agency in particular the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensee of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensee the nature of the service that licensee may offer and how the service may be offered and the resolution of issue of interference operator in the same or adjacent spectrum band change necessary to resolve interference issue or concern may have significant impact on our ability to fully utilize our spectrum an example we recently won spectrum license in the so called band to support our continued rollout of technology and service there have been concern raised that use of this spectrum by wireless carrier for deployment could interfere with the altimeter in certain aircraft and there is an ongoing discussion between the industry the fcc and the faa to whether and how operation should be limited around airport additionally the ftc and other federal and state agency have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection matter and the elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of wireless product and service we can not assure that the fcc or any other federal state or local agency will not adopt regulation implement new program or take enforcement or other action that would adversely affect our business impose new cost or require change in current or planned operation including timing of the shutdown of legacy technology for example in response to the pandemic the california public utility commission adopted resolution providing moratorium on customer disconnect and late fee for certain california customer facing financial hardship additionally in and the fcc established net neutrality and privacy regime that applied to our operation both set of rule potentially subjected some of our initiative and practice to more burdensome requirement and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulator the public edge provider of contentsand private litigant regarding whether such initiative or practice are compliant while the fcc rule were largely rolled back in december the current fcc updated transparency obligation to require nutrition style broadband label disclosure effective potentially in that could prompt regulatory inquiry and the fcc could decide to establish new net neutrality requirement in addition some state and other jurisdiction have enacted law in these area including for example california and other state net neutrality law the ccpa and cpra discussed below and others are considering enacting similar law it also is uncertain what rule may be promulgated under the current administration the ftc ha discussed promulgating privacy rule perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issue in addition state are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication service provider provide to their customer and several state have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulation in this area we also face potential investigation by and inquiry from or action by state public utility commission we also can not assure that congress will not amend the communication act from which the fcc obtains it authority and which serf to limit state authority or enact other legislation in manner that could be adverse to our business failure to comply with applicable regulation could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty including in extreme case revocation of our spectrum license for failure to comply with the fcc or other governmental regulation even if any such noncompliance wa unintentional the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result law and regulation relating to the handling of privacy and data protection may result in increased cost legal claim fine against or reputational damage in january the california consumer privacy act the ccpa became effective creating new data privacy right for california resident and new compliance obligation for and industry in general in addition to private right of action for certain type of data breach moreover new privacy law are being developed and or enacted in many jurisdiction for example in colorado utah connecticut virginia and in california where the california privacy right act cpra which modifies the ccpa recently became effective all of these new privacy law and others that we expect to be developed and enacted going forward will impose additional data protection obligation and potential liability on company such ours doing business in those state we have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation cost to ensure compliance with the ccpa the cpra new privacy law in other state and their related regulation including managing the complexity of law that vary from state to state both federal and state government are considering additional privacy law and regulation which if passed could further impact our business strategy offering and initiative and cause to incur further cost any actual or perceived failure to comply with the ccpa cpra other data privacy law or regulation or related contractual or other obligation or any perceived privacy right violation could lead to investigation claim and proceeding by governmental entity and private party damage for contract breach and other significant cost penalty and other liability well harm to our reputation and market position unfavorable outcome of legal proceeding may adversely affect our business reputation financial condition cash flow and

putative class action lawsuit or shareholder derivative action against the company and the legacy mobile board of director and or the legacy sprint board of director among other remedy these stockholder could seek damage the outcome of any litigation is uncertain and any such potential lawsuit could result in substantial cost and may be costly and distracting to management additionally on april in connection with the closing of the merger we assumed the contingency and litigation matter of sprint those matter include wide variety of dispute claim government agency investigation and enforcement of contentsactions and other proceeding unfavorable resolution of these matter could require making additional reimbursement and paying additional fine and penalty on february we received

authorization based on our investigation to date the impacted api is only able to provide limited set of customer account data including name billing address email phone number date of birth mobile account number and information such the number of line on the account and plan feature the result from our investigation to date indicates that the bad actor obtained data from this api for

whether change in our customer behavior could negatively impact our result of operation on an ongoing basis although we presently do not expect that it will have material effect on our operation additionally following the august cyberattack we commenced substantial multi year investment working with leading external cybersecurity expert to enhance our cybersecurity capability and transform our approach to cybersecurity while we have made progress to date we plan to continue to make substantial investment to strengthen our cybersecurity program in future period revenue trendsin we expect service revenue to continue to grow primarily due to continued postpaid account and customer growth well postpaid average revenue per account postpaid arpa growth driven by the execution of our strategy to continuously deepen our account relationship including growth in high speed internet we expect the increase in postpaid service revenue to be partially offset by decrease in wholesale and other service revenue primarily driven by the sale of the wireline business which is expected to close mid the migration by verizon of legacy tracfone customer off of the mobile network and dish

intangible assetsintangible asset that do not have indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life through the merger we acquired lease agreement the agreement with various educational and non profit institution that provide with the right to use federal communication commission fcc spectrum license educational broadband service or eb spectrum in the ghz band in addition to the agreement with educational institution and private owner who hold the license we also acquired direct ownership of spectrum license previously acquired by sprint through government auction or other acquisition the agreement with educational and certain non profit institution are typically for term of five to year with automatic renewal provision bringing the total term of the agreement up to year majority of the agreement include right of first refusal to acquire lease or otherwise use the license at the end of the automatic renewal period for note to the consolidated financial statementsleased fcc spectrum license are recorded executory contract whereby result of business combination accounting an intangible asset or liability is recorded reflecting the extent to which contractual term are favorable or unfavorable to current market rate these intangible asset or liability are amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the lease agreement contractual lease payment are recognized on straight line basis over the remaining term of the arrangement including renewal and are presented in cost of service on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income customer list and the sprint trade name are amortized using the sum of the year digit method over the period in which the asset is expected to contribute to future cash flow reacquired right are amortized on straight line basis over the remaining term of the management agreement defined in note business combination which represents the period of expected economic benefit the remaining finite lived intangible asset are amortized using the straight line method goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assetsgoodwillgoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net asset acquired in business combination and is assigned to our one reporting unit wireless spectrum licensesspectrum license are carried at cost incurred to acquire the spectrum license and the cost to prepare the spectrum license for their intended use such cost to clear acquired spectrum license the fcc issue spectrum license which provide with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service area to provide wireless communication service spectrum license are issued for fixed period of time typically up to year however the fcc ha granted license renewal routinely and at nominal cost the spectrum license acquired expire at various date and we believe we will be able to meet all requirement necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum license at nominal cost moreover we determined that there are currently no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor that limit the useful life of our spectrum license the utility of radio frequency spectrum doe not diminish while activated on our network doe it otherwise deteriorate over time therefore we determined the spectrum license should be treated indefinite lived intangible asset at time we enter into agreement to sell or exchange spectrum license upon entering into the arrangement if the transaction ha been deemed to have commercial substance spectrum license are reviewed for impairment the license are transferred at their carrying value adjusted for any impairment recognized to asset held for sale which is included in other current asset on our consolidated balance sheet until approval and completion of the exchange or sale upon closing of the transaction spectrum license acquired part of an exchange of nonmonetary asset are recorded at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum license obtained carrying value of the spectrum license transferred and cash paid if any is recognized gain or loss on disposal of spectrum license included in selling general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income our fair value estimate of spectrum license are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data if the transaction lack commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable the acquired spectrum license are recorded at our carrying value of the spectrum asset transferred or exchanged the spectrum license we hold plus the spectrum lease enhance the overall value of our spectrum license the collective value is higher than the value of individual band of spectrum within specific geography this value is derived from the ability to provide wireless service to customer across large geographic area and maintain the same or similar wireless connectivity quality this enhanced value from combining owned and leased spectrum license is referred to an aggregation premium the aggregation premium is component of the overall fair value of our owned fcc spectrum license which are recorded indefinite lived intangible asset impairmentwe ass the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license portfolio for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate such asset might be impaired we test goodwill on reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to it book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured of december we have identified one reporting for note to the consolidated financial statementsunit for which discrete financial information is available and result are regularly reviewed by management wireless the wireless reporting unit consists of all the asset and liability of mobile inc when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit in we employed qualitative approach to ass the wireless reporting unit the fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor change in market capitalization to determine whether decline if any necessitate an interim impairment review in the event market capitalization doe decline below it book value we will consider the length severity and reason for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists including considering whether control premium should be added to the market capitalization we believe short term fluctuation in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value no event or change in circumstance have occurred that indicate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit may be below it carrying amount at december we test our spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference in we employed the qualitative method we estimate fair value of spectrum license using the greenfield methodology the greenfield methodology value the spectrum license by calculating the cash flow generating potential of hypothetical start up company that go into business with no asset except for the asset to be valued in this case spectrum license and make investment required to build an operation comparable to current use the value of the spectrum license can be considered equal to the present value of the cash flow of this hypothetical start up company we base the assumption underlying the greenfield methodology on combination of market participant data and our historical result trend and business plan future cash flow in the greenfield methodology are based on estimate and assumption of market participant revenue ebitda margin network build out period and long term growth rate for market participant the cash flow are discounted using weighted average cost of capital no event or change in circumstance have occurred that indicate the fair value of the spectrum license may be below their carrying amount at december the valuation approach utilized to estimate fair value for the purpose of the impairment test of goodwill and spectrum license require the use of assumption and estimate which involve degree of uncertainty if actual result or future expectation are not consistent with the assumption used in our estimate of fair value it may result in the recording of significant impairment charge on goodwill or spectrum license the most significant assumption within the valuation model are the discount rate revenue ebitda margin capital expenditure and long term growth rate for more information regarding our impairment assessment see note summary of significant accounting policy and note goodwill spectrum license transaction and other intangible asset of the note to the consolidated financial statement fair value measurementswe carry certain asset and liability at fair value fair value is defined an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the three tier hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value which prioritizes the input based on the observability of the measurement date is follows level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable input other than the quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability andlevel unobservable input for which there is little or no market data which require to develop assumption of what market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability for note to the consolidated financial statementsassets and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of asset and liability being measured within the fair value hierarchy the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent account receivable account receivable from affiliate and account payable and accrued liability approximate fair value due to the short term maturity of these instrument the carrying value of eip receivables approximate fair value the receivables are recorded at their present value using an imputed interest rate with the exception of certain long term fixed rate debt there were no financial instrument with carrying value materially different from their fair value see note fair value measurement for comparison of the carrying value and fair value of our short term and long term debt derivative financial instrumentsderivative financial instrument are recognized either asset or liability and are measured at fair value we do not use derivative for trading or speculative purpose for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge associated with forecasted debt issuance change in fair value are reported component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into interest expense net in the same period the hedged transaction affect earnings unrealized gain on derivative designated in qualifying cash flow hedge relationship are recorded at fair value asset and unrealized loss are recorded at fair value liability we did not have any significant derivative instrument outstanding of december or revenue recognitionwe primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless communication service and selling or leasing device and accessory to customer our contract with customer may involve more than one performance obligation which include wireless service wireless device or combination thereof and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on it relative standalone selling price wireless communication service revenuewe generate our wireless communication service revenue from providing access to and usage of our wireless communication network service revenue also include revenue earned for providing premium service to customer such device insurance service service contract are billed monthly either in advance or arrears or are prepaid generally service revenue is recognized we satisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customer we typically satisfy our stand ready performance obligation including unlimited wireless service evenly over the contract term for usage based and prepaid wireless service we satisfy our performance obligation when service are rendered the enforceable duration of our contract with customer is typically one month however promotional eip bill credit offered to customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether substantive penalty is deemed to exist revenue is recorded net of cost paid to another party for performance obligation where we arrange for the other party to transfer good or service to the customer when we are acting an agent for example performance obligation relating to service provided by third party content provider where we neither control right to the content provider service nor control the underlying service are presented net because we are acting an agent consideration payable to customer is treated reduction of the total transaction price unless the payment is in exchange for distinct good or service such certain commission paid to dealer in which case the payment is treated purchase of that distinct good or service federal universal service fund usf and state usf are assessed by various governmental authority in connection with the service we provide to our customer and are included in cost of service when we separately bill and collect these regulatory fee from customer they are recorded gross in total service revenue on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended december and we recorded approximately million million and million respectively of usf fee on gross basis for note to the consolidated financial statementswe have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all tax assessed by governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transaction and collected by from customer sale use value added and some excise tax wireline revenueperformance obligation related to our wireline customer include the provision of domestic and international data communication service wireline revenue are included in other service revenue on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income equipment revenueswe generate equipment revenue from the sale or lease of mobile communication device and accessory equipment revenue related to device and accessory sale are typically recognized at point in time when control of the device or accessory is transferred to the customer or dealer we have elected to account for shipping and handling activity that occur after control of the related good transfer fulfillment activity instead of assessing such activity performance obligation we estimate variable consideration device return or certain payment to indirect dealer primarily based on historical experience equipment sale not probable of collection are generally recorded payment are received our assessment of collectibility considers contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk we offer certain customer the option to pay for device and accessory in installment using an eip generally we recognize reduction of the total transaction price the effect of financing component in contract where customer purchase their device and accessory on an eip with term of more than one year including those financing component that are not considered to be significant to the contract however we have elected the practical expedient of not recognizing the effect of significant financing component for contract where we expect at contract inception that the period between the transfer of performance obligation to customer and the customer payment for that performance obligation will be one year or le our leasing program allow customer to lease device over period of up to month and upgrade the device with new device when eligibility requirement are met to date substantially all of our leased wireless device are accounted for operating lease and estimated contract consideration is allocated between lease and non lease element such service and equipment performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract lease revenue are recorded equipment revenue and recognized earned on straight line basis over the lease term lease revenue on contract not probable of collection are limited to the amount of payment received see property and equipment above for further information imputed interest on eip receivablesfor eip greater than month we record the effect of financing on all eip receivables regardless of whether or not the financing is considered to be significant the imputation of interest result in discount of the eip receivable thereby adjusting the transaction price of the contract with the customer which is then allocated to the performance obligation of the arrangement for transaction where we recognize significant financing component judgment is required to determine the discount rate for eip sale the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk of the customer customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see receivables and allowance for credit loss above for additional discussion on how we ass credit risk for receivables associated with an end service customer in which the sale of the device wa not directly to the end customer sell in model or device sourced directly from oem the effect of imputing interest is recognized reduction to service revenue over the service contract period in these transaction the provision of wireless communication service is the only performance obligation the device sale wa recognized when transferred to the dealer contract balancesgenerally our device and service plan are available at standard price which are maintained on price list and published on our website and or within our retail store for note to the consolidated financial statementsfor contract that involve more than one product or service that are identified separate performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price the standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell the good or service separately to customer and is most commonly evidenced by the price at which we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration we must perform additional service in order to receive consideration amount are recorded receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional when consideration is received or we have an unconditional right to consideration in advance of delivery of good or service contract liability is recorded the transaction price can include non refundable upfront fee which are allocated to the identifiable performance obligation contract asset are included in other current asset and other asset and contract liability are included in deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet see note revenue from contract with customer for further information contract modificationsour service contract allow customer to frequently modify their contract without incurring penalty in many case each time contract is modified we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated separate contract if there is termination of the existing contract and creation of new contract or if the modification should be considered change associated with the existing contract we typically do not have significant impact from contract modification contract costswe incur certain incremental cost to obtain contract that we expect to recover such sale commission we record an asset when these incremental cost to obtain contract are incurred and amortize them on systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the good or service to which the asset relates we capitalize postpaid sale commission for service activation cost to acquire contract and amortize them on straight line basis over the estimated period of benefit currently month for capitalized contract cost determining the amortization period over which such cost are recognized well assessing the indicator of impairment may require judgment prepaid commission are expensed incurred their estimated period of benefit doe not extend beyond month commission paid upon device upgrade are not capitalized if the remaining customer contract is le than one year commission paid when the customer ha lease are treated initial direct cost and recognized over the lease term incremental cost to obtain equipment contract commission paid on device and accessory sale are recognized when the equipment is transferred to the customer see note revenue from contract with customer for further information leasescell site retail store and office facility leaseswe are lessee for non cancelable operating and financing lease for cell site switch site retail store network equipment office facility and dark fiber we recognize right of use asset and lease liability for operating lease based on the net present value of future minimum lease payment the right of use asset for an operating lease is based on the lease liability lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the non cancelable lease term and renewal period that are considered reasonably certain in addition we have financing lease for certain network equipment we recognize right of use asset and lease liability for financing lease based on the net present value of future minimum lease payment the right of use asset for finance lease is based on the lease liability expense for our financing lease is comprised of the amortization expense associated with the right of use asset and interest expense recognized based on the effective interest method we consider several factor in assessing whether renewal period are reasonably certain of being exercised including the continued maturation of our nationwide network technological advance within the telecommunication industry and the availability of alternative site we have concluded we are not reasonably certain to exercise the option to extend or terminate our lease therefore of the lease commencement date our lease term generally do not include these option we include option to extend or terminate lease when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option for note to the consolidated financial statementsin determining the discount rate used to measure the right of use asset and lease liability we use rate implicit in the lease or if not readily available we use our incremental borrowing rate our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of risk free rate plus credit spread secured by our asset determining credit spread secured by our asset may require significant judgment certain of our lease agreement include rental payment based on change in the consumer price index cpi lease liability are not remeasured result of change in the cpi instead change in the cpi are treated variable lease payment and are excluded from the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability these payment are recognized in the period in which the related obligation is incurred our lease agreement do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenant generally we elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non lease component in arrangement where we are the lessee for arrangement in which we are the lessor of wireless handset device we did not elect this practical expedient we did not elect the short term lease recognition exemption such lease with term shorter than month are included right of use asset and lease liability rental revenue

the level of allowance for credit loss by considering credit risk inherent within each portfolio segment of the end of the period we consider receivable past due when customer ha not paid by the contractually specified payment due date account balance are written off against the allowance for credit loss if collection effort are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible customer default based on factor such customer credit rating well the length of time the amount are past due our portfolio of receivables is comprised of two portfolio segment account receivable and

trend such write off frequency and severity we also consider other qualitative factor such current and forecasted macroeconomic condition we consider the need to adjust our estimate of credit loss for reasonable and supportable forecast of future macroeconomic condition to do so we monitor external forecast of change in real gross domestic product and forecast of consumer credit behavior for comparable credit exposure we also periodically evaluate other macroeconomic indicator such unemployment rate to ass their level of correlation with our historical credit loss statistic eip receivables portfolio segmentbased upon customer credit profile at the time of customer origination we classify the eip receivables segment into two customer class of prime and subprime prime customer receivables are those with lower credit risk and subprime customer receivables are those with higher credit risk customer may be required to make down payment on their equipment purchase if their assessed credit risk exceeds established underwriting threshold in addition certain customer within the subprime category may be required to pay deposit to determine customer credit profile and assist in determining their credit class we use proprietary credit scoring model that measure the credit quality of customer leveraging several factor such credit bureau information and consumer credit risk score well service and device plan characteristic installment receivables acquired in the merger are included in eip receivables we applied our proprietary credit scoring model to the customer acquired in the merger with an outstanding eip receivable balance based on tenure consumer credit risk score and credit profile these acquired customer were classified into our customer class of prime

calculate default probability or an estimate for the frequency of customer default our assessment of default probability or frequency includes receivables delinquency status historical loss experience how long the receivables have been outstanding and customer credit rating well customer tenure we multiply these estimated default probability by our estimated loss given default which is the estimated amount or severity of the default loss after adjusting for estimated recovery we do for our account receivable portfolio segment we consider the need to adjust our estimate of credit loss on

government agency investigation and enforcement action and other proceeding litigation and regulatory matter that arise in the ordinary course of business which include claim of patent infringement most of which are asserted by non practicing entity primarily seeking monetary damage class action and proceeding to enforce fcc or other government agency rule and regulation those litigation and regulatory matter are at various stage and some of them may proceed to trial arbitration hearing or other adjudication that could result in fine penalty or award of monetary or injunctive relief in the coming month if they are not otherwise resolved we have established an accrual with respect to certain of these matter where appropriate the accrual are reflected on our consolidated for note to the consolidated financial statementsfinancial statement but they are not considered to be individually or in the aggregate material an accrual is established when we believe it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated for other matter where we have not determined that loss is probable or because the amount of loss can not be reasonably estimated we have not recorded an accrual due to various factor typical in contested proceeding including but not limited to uncertainty concerning legal theory and their resolution by court or regulator uncertain damage theory and demand and le than fully developed factual record for litigation and regulatory matter that may result in contingent gain we recognize such gain on our consolidated financial statement when the gain is realized or realizable we recognize legal cost expected to be incurred in connection with litigation and regulatory matter they are incurred except otherwise specified below we do not expect that the ultimate resolution of these litigation and regulatory matter individually or in the aggregate will have material adverse effect on our financial position but we note that an unfavorable outcome of some or all of the specific matter identified below or other matter that we are or may become involved in could have material adverse impact on result of operation or cash flow for particular period this assessment is based on our current understanding of relevant fact and circumstance such our view of these matter is subject to inherent uncertainty and may change in the future on february we received notice of apparent liability for forfeiture and admonishment from the fcc which proposed penalty against for allegedly violating section of the communication act and the fcc regulation governing the privacy of customer information in the first quarter of we recorded an accrual for an estimated payment amount we maintained the accrual of december and that accrual wa included in account payable and accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet on april in connection with the closing of the merger we assumed the contingency and litigation matter of sprint those matter include wide variety of dispute claim government agency investigation and enforcement action and other proceeding these matter include among other thing certain ongoing fcc and state government agency investigation into sprint lifeline program in september sprint notified the fcc that it had claimed monthly subsidy for serving subscriber even though these subscriber may not have met usage requirement under sprint usage policy for the lifeline program due to an inadvertent coding issue in the system used to identify qualifying subscriber usage that occurred in july while the system wa being updated sprint ha made number of payment to reimburse the federal government and certain state for excess subsidy payment we note that pursuant to amendment no dated of february to the business combination agreement softbank agreed to indemnify against certain specified matter and loss including those relating to the lifeline matter described above resolution of these matter could require making additional reimbursement and paying additional fine and penalty which we do not expect to have significant impact on our financial result we expect that any additional liability related to these indemnified matter would be indemnified and reimbursed by softbank on june putative shareholder class action and derivative lawsuit wa filed in the delaware court of chancery dinkevich deutsche telekom ag et al case no no against dt softbank and certain of our current and former officer and director asserting breach of fiduciary duty claim relating to the repricing amendment to the business combination agreement and to softbank monetization of it mobile share we are also named nominal defendant in the case we are unable to predict the potential outcome of these claim in october we notified mobile virtual network operator mvnos using the legacy sprint cdma network that we planned to retire that network on december in response to that notice dish which had boost mobile

cpuc proceeding remain in process on august we became aware of cybersecurity issue involving unauthorized access to mobile system the august cyberattack we immediately began an investigation and engaged cybersecurity expert to assist with the assessment of the incident and to help determine what data wa impacted our investigation uncovered that the perpetrator had illegally gained access to certain area of our system on or about march but only gained access to and took data of current former and prospective customer beginning on or about august with the assistance of our outside cybersecurity expert we located and closed the unauthorized access to our system and identified current former and prospective customer whose information wa impacted and notified them consistent with state and federal requirement we also undertook number of other measure to demonstrate our continued support and commitment to data privacy and protection we also coordinated with law enforcement our forensic investigation is complete and we believe we have full view of the data compromised for note to the consolidated financial statementsas result of the august cyberattack we have become subject to numerous lawsuit including mass arbitration claim and multiple class action lawsuit that have been filed in numerous jurisdiction seeking among other thing unspecified monetary damage cost and attorney fee arising out of the august cyberattack in december the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation consolidated the federal class action lawsuit in the district court for the western district of missouri under the caption in re mobile customer data security breach litigation case no md bcw on july we entered into an agreement to settle the lawsuit on july we received preliminary approval of the proposed settlement which remains subject to final court approval the court conducted final approval hearing on january and we await ruling from the court if approved by the court under the term of the proposed settlement we would pay an aggregate of million to fund claim submitted by class member the legal fee of plaintiff counsel and the cost of administering the settlement we would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of million for data security and related technology in and we anticipate that upon court approval the settlement will provide full release of all claim arising out of the august cyberattack by class member who do not opt out against all defendant including our subsidiary and affiliate and our director and officer the settlement contains no admission of liability wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendant we have the right to terminate the settlement agreement under certain condition if approved by the court we anticipate that this settlement of the class action along with other settlement of separate consumer claim that have been previously completed or are currently pending will resolve substantially all of the claim brought to date by our current former and prospective customer who were impacted by the cyberattack in connection with the proposed class action settlement and the separate settlement we recorded

income during the year ended december we recognized million in reimbursement from insurance carrier for cost incurred related to the august cyberattack which is included reduction to selling general and administrative expense on our consolidated statement of comprehensive income the ultimate resolution of the class action depends on whether we will be able to obtain court approval of the proposed settlement the number of plaintiff who opt out of the proposed settlement and whether the proposed settlement will be appealed in addition in september purported company shareholder filed derivative action in the delaware chancery court under the caption harper sievert et al case no sg against our current director and certain of our former director alleging claim for breach of fiduciary duty relating to the company cybersecurity practice we are also named nominal defendant in the lawsuit we are unable at this time to predict the potential outcome of this lawsuit or whether we may be subject to further private litigation we have also received inquiry from various government agency law enforcement and other governmental authority related to the august cyberattack which could result in substantial fine or penalty we are responding to these inquiry and cooperating fully with these agency and regulator however we can not predict the timing or outcome of any of these matter or whether we may be subject to further regulatory inquiry investigation or enforcement action in light of the inherent uncertainty involved in such matter and based on the information currently available to we believe it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional loss associated with these proceeding and inquiry and we will continue to evaluate information it becomes known and will record an estimate for loss at the time or time when it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable ongoing legal and other cost related to these proceeding and inquiry well any potential future action may be substantial and loss associated with any adverse judgment settlement penalty or other resolution of such proceeding and inquiry could be material to our business reputation financial condition cash flow and operating result in we received million in gross settlement of certain patent litigation assumed in the merger we

information wa impacted consistent with state and federal requirement in connection with the january cyberattack we have received notice of consumer class action and regulatory inquires to which we will respond to in due course and may incur significant expense however we can not predict the timing or outcome of any of these potential matter or whether we may be subject to additional legal proceeding claim regulatory inquiry investigation or enforcement action in addition we are unable to predict the full impact of this incident on customer behavior in the future including whether
