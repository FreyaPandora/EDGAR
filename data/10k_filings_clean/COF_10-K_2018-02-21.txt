which we are aware at the time this report ha been filed other risk may prove to be important in the future including those that are not currently ascertainable in addition to the factor discussed elsewhere in this report other factor that could cause actual result to differ materially from our forward looking statement include general economic and market riskschanges and instability in the macroeconomic environment may adversely affect our industry business result of operation and financial condition we offer broad array of financial product and service to consumer small business and commercial client we market our credit card product on national basis throughout the united state canada and the united kingdom and offer banking and other service in many region within the united state prolonged period of economic volatility slow growth or significant deterioration in economic condition in the united state or one of these country could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and result of operation customer default on their loan or maintain lower deposit level or in the case of credit card account carry lower balance and reduce credit card purchase activity of the risk we may face in connection with adverse change and instability in macroeconomic environment include the following payment pattern may change causing increase in delinquency and default rate which could have negative impact on our result of operation in addition change in consumer confidence level and behavior including decreased consumer spending lower demand for credit and shift in consumer payment behavior towards avoiding late fee finance charge and other fee could have negative impact on our result of operation increase in bankruptcy could cause increase in our charge off rate which could have negative impact on our result of operation our ability to recover debt that we have previously charged off may be limited which could have negative impact on our result of operation the process and model we use to estimate our allowance for loan and lease loss may become le reliable if volatile economic condition change in the competitive environment significant change in customer behavior or other unexpected variation in key input and assumption cause actual loss to diverge from the projection of our model result our estimate for credit loss may become increasingly subject to management judgment and high level of volatility over short period of time which could negatively impact our result of operation see there are risk resulting from the extensive use of model and data in our business risk associated with financial market instability and volatility could cause material adverse effect on our liquidity and our funding cost for example increase in interest rate and our credit spread could negatively impact our result of operation our ability to borrow from other financial institution or to engage in funding transaction on favorable term or at all could be adversely affected by disruption in the capital market or other event including action by rating agency and deteriorating investor expectation which could limit our access to funding while interest rate have risen from historic low set in both shorter term and longer term interest rate remain below long term historical average and the yield curve ha been relatively flat compared to past period flat yield curve combined with low interest rate generally lead to lower revenue and reduced margin because it tends to limit our ability to increase the spread between asset yield and funding cost sustained period of time with flat yield curve coupled with low interest rate could have material adverse effect on our earnings and our net interest margin one financial corporation cof table of contentsregulatory riskcompliance with new and existing law regulation and regulatory expectation may increase our cost reduce our revenue limit our ability to pursue business opportunity and increase compliance challenge legislation and regulation with respect to the financial service industry ha increased in recent year and we expect that oversight of our business may continue to expand in scope and complexity wide array of banking and consumer lending law apply to almost every aspect of our business failure to comply with these law and regulation could result in financial structural and operational penalty including significant fine and criminal sanction and could result in negative publicity or damage to our reputation with regulator or the public in addition establishing system and process to achieve compliance with these law and regulation may increase our cost and limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunity we are subject to heightened regulatory oversight by the federal banking regulator to ensure that we build system and process that are commensurate with the nature of our business and that meet the heightened risk management and enhanced prudential standard issued by our regulator for example over the last several year state and federal regulator have focused on compliance with the bank secrecy act and anti money laundering law data integrity and security use of service provider fair lending and other consumer protection issue in july capital one entered into consent order with the occ to address concern about our anti money laundering aml program aml program although we are making substantial progress in taking the step and making the improvement required by the occ consent order we expect heightened oversight of our aml program will continue for the foreseeable future the dodd frank act other regulatory reform and implementing regulation have increased our need to develop monitor and maintain compliance process and infrastructure and to otherwise enhance our risk management throughout all aspect of our business the cumulative impact of these change also includes higher expectation for the amount of capital and liquidity we must maintain discussed in more detail below under the heading we may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity level which could have negative impact on our financial result and our ability to return capital to our shareholder and higher operational cost which may further increase regulator continue to implement such reform united state government agency charged with adopting and interpreting law rule and regulation including under the dodd frank act may do so in an unforeseen manner including in way that potentially expand the impact of such law rule or regulation on more than initially contemplated or currently anticipated both congress and the regulator continue to review the law and regulation that could have impact beyond those initially contemplated or currently anticipated we have large number of customer account in our credit card and auto lending business and we have made the strategic choice to originate and service subprime credit card and auto loan which typically have higher delinquency and charge offs than prime customer accordingly we have significant involvement with credit bureau reporting and the collection and recovery of delinquent and charged off debt primarily through customer communication the filing of litigation against customer in default the periodic sale of charged off debt and vehicle repossession the banking industry is subject to enhanced legal and regulatory scrutiny regarding credit bureau reporting and debt collection practice from regulator court and legislator any future change to our business practice in these area including our debt collection practice whether mandated by regulator court legislator or otherwise or any legal liability resulting from our business practice including our debt collection practice could have material adverse impact on our financial condition the legislative and regulatory environment is beyond our control may change rapidly and unpredictably and may negatively influence our revenue cost earnings growth liquidity and capital level in addition some rule and regulation may be subject to litigation or other challenge that delay or modify their implementation and impact on for example the tax act ha resulted in material impact to our result of operation due to change to the valuation of our deferred tax asset the valuation of other tax asset and tax expense and may affect customer behavior and our ability to forecast our effective tax rate many aspect of the tax act are unclear and may not be clarified for some time result we have not yet been able to determine the full impact of the new law on our business operating result and financial condition for example in the united kingdom and europe continued regulatory uncertainty or change arising from brexit negotiation could adversely affect our operation certain law and regulation and any interpretation and application with respect thereto may benefit consumer borrower and depositor but not shareholder our success depends on our ability to maintain compliance with both existing and new law and regulation for description of the material law and regulation to which we are subject please refer to part item business supervision and regulation one financial corporation cof table of contentscredit riskwe may experience increased delinquency credit loss inaccurate estimate and inadequate reserve like other lender we face the risk that our customer will not repay their loan customer ability and willingness to repay can be negatively impacted by increase in their payment obligation to other lender whether result of higher debt level or rising interest rate or by restricted availability of credit generally we may fail to quickly identify customer that are likely to default on their payment obligation and reduce our exposure by closing credit line and restricting authorization which could adversely impact our financial condition and result of operation our ability to manage credit risk also may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory change such restriction on collection bankruptcy law minimum payment regulation and age guidance competitor action and consumer behavior well inadequate collection staffing technique and model rising loss or leading indicator of rising loss such higher delinquency higher rate of non performing loan higher bankruptcy rate lower collateral value or elevated unemployment rate may require to increase our allowance for loan and lease loss which may degrade our profitability if we are unable to raise revenue or reduce cost to compensate for higher loss in particular we face the following risk in this area missed payment our customer may miss payment loan charge offs including from bankruptcy are generally preceded by missed payment or other indication of worsening financial condition for our customer customer are more likely to miss payment during an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in addition we face the risk that consumer and commercial customer behavior may change for example an increase in the unwillingness or inability of customer to repay debt which may be heightened by increasing interest rate or level of consumer debt generally causing long term rise in delinquency and charge offs estimate of inherent loss the credit quality of our portfolio can have significant impact on our earnings we allow for and reserve against credit risk based on our assessment of credit loss inherent in our loan portfolio this process which is critical to our financial result and condition requires complex judgment including forecast of economic condition we may underestimate our inherent loss and fail to hold an allowance for loan and lease loss sufficient to account for these loss incorrect assumption could lead to material underestimation of inherent loss and inadequate allowance for loan and lease loss in case where we modify loan if the modification do not perform anticipated we may be required to build additional allowance on these loan the build or release of allowance impact our current financial result underwriting our ability to accurately ass the creditworthiness of our customer may diminish which could result in an increase in our credit loss and deterioration of our return see our risk management strategy may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environment or against all type of risk business mix we engage in diverse mix of business with broad range of potential credit exposure our business mix could change in way that could adversely affect the credit quality of our portfolio because we originate relatively greater proportion of consumer loan in our loan portfolio compared to other large bank peer and originate both prime and subprime credit card account and auto loan we may experience higher delinquency and greater number of account charging off compared to other large bank peer which could result in increased credit loss operating cost and regulatory scrutiny charge off recognition allowance for loan and lease loss we account for the allowance for loan and lease loss according to accounting and regulatory guideline and rule including financial accounting standard board fasb standard and the federal financial institution examination council ffiec account management guidance in june the fasb issued revised guidance for impairment on financial instrument the guidance which becomes effective on january with early adoption permitted no earlier than january requires use of current expected credit loss cecl model that is based on expected rather than incurred loss adoption of the cecl model could require change in our account management or allowance for loan and lease loss practice and may cause our allowance for loan and lease loss and credit loss to change materially industry development our charge off and delinquency rate may be negatively impacted by industry development including new regulation applicable to our industry one financial corporation cof table of content collateral the collateral we have on secured loan could be insufficient to compensate for loan loss when customer default on their secured loan we attempt to recover collateral where permissible and appropriate however the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from our customer decrease in real estate value adversely affect the collateral value for our commercial lending activity while the auto business is similarly exposed to collateral risk arising from the auction market that determine used car price therefore the recovery of such property could be insufficient to compensate for the value of these loan borrower may be le likely to continue making payment on loan if the value of the property used collateral for the loan is le than the borrower owes even if the borrower is still financially able to make the payment trend in home price are driver of credit cost in our home loan business they impact both the probability of default and the loss severity of default additionally the potential volatility in the number of defaulted and modified loan from change in home price can create material impact on the servicing cost of the business fluctuation in credit mark and profitability in acquired portfolio and volatility in mortgage servicing right valuation although home price have generally appreciated recently the slow economic recovery shift in monetary policy and potentially diminishing demand from investor could threaten or limit the recovery in our auto business if vehicle price experience decline we could be adversely affected for example business and economic condition that negatively affect household income housing price and consumer behavior related to our business could decrease the demand for new and used vehicle and ii the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of auto loan which could cause the number of consumer who become delinquent or default on their loan to increase geographic and industry concentration although our consumer lending is geographically diversified approximately of our commercial loan portfolio is concentrated in the tri state area of new york new jersey and connecticut the regional economic condition in the tri state area affect the demand for our commercial product and service well the ability of our customer to repay their commercial loan and the value of the collateral securing these loan an economic downturn or prolonged period of slow economic growth in or catastrophic event that disproportionately affect the tri state area could have material adverse effect on the performance of our commercial loan portfolio and our result of operation in addition our commercial banking strategy includes an industry specific focus if any of the industry that we focus on experience change we may experience increased credit loss and our result of operation could be adversely impacted for example of december energy related loan balance represented approximately of our total commercial loan portfolio this amount is comprised of loan to commercial entity in the energy industry such exploration and production oil field service and pipeline transportation of gas and crude oil well loan to entity in industry that are indirectly impacted by energy price such petroleum wholesaler oil and gas equipment manufacturing air transportation and petroleum bulk station and terminal in recent year oil price have fluctuated significantly which ha impacted many of the borrower in this portfolio and the value of the collateral securing our loan to these borrower prolonged period of declining oil price could impair their ability to service loan outstanding to them and or reduce demand for loan if energy related industry or any of the other industry that we focus on experience adverse change we may experience increased credit loss and our result of operation could be adversely impacted capital and liquidity riskwe may not be able to maintain adequate capital or liquidity level which could have negative impact on our financial result and our ability to return capital to our shareholder result of the dodd frank act and the united state implementation of international accord financial institution are subject to new and increased capital and liquidity requirement and we expect further change to these regulation although united state regulator have finalized regulation for many of these requirement continued uncertainty remains to the form additional new requirement will take or how and when they will apply to result it is possible that we could be required to increase our capital and or liquidity level above the level assumed in our current financial plan these new requirement could have negative impact on our ability to lend grow deposit balance or make acquisition and limit our ability to make most capital distribution higher capital level also lower our return on equity in addition described further above in part item business supervision and regulation for regulatory capital purpose we entered parallel run on january we will become subject to the basel iii advanced approach framework for purpose of determining our regulatory capital requirement we receive regulatory approval to do so although the exact timing of when such approval may be granted is uncertain although we have current estimate of risk weighted asset calculation under that framework there remains uncertainty around future regulatory interpretation of certain aspect of those calculation moreover the so called collins amendment to the dodd frank act implemented in the basel iii capital rule establishes capital floor so that organization subject to the basel iii advanced approach may not hold le capital than would be required using the one financial corporation cof table of contentsbasel iii standardized approach capital calculation additionally in december the basel committee on banking supervision finalized certain modification to the international basel iii capital standard which if implemented by the united state federal banking agency could alter regulatory capital requirement therefore we can not assure you that our current estimate will be correct and we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in the future than we currently estimate to maintain given capital ratio in april the united state federal banking agency proposed rule regarding the united state implementation of the net stable funding ratio proposed nsfr see part item business supervision and regulation for further detail regarding the proposed nsfr the financial and operational impact on of final nsfr rule remains uncertain until final rule is published and there is uncertainty to the combined impact of the existing liquidity coverage ratio and any final nsfr on how we manage our business see note regulatory and capital adequacy and part item business supervision and regulation dividend stock repurchase and transfer of fund for additional information regarding recent development in capital and liquidity requirement we consider various factor in the management of capital including the impact of stress on our capital level determined by both our internal modeling and the federal reserve modeling of our capital position in supervisory stress test and ccar there can be significant difference between our modeling and the federal reserve estimate for given scenario and between the capital need suggested by our internal bank holding company scenario relative to the supervisory scenario therefore although our estimated capital level under stress disclosed part of the ccar or dfast process may suggest that we have substantial capacity to return capital to shareholder and remain well capitalized under stress the federal reserve modeling our own modeling of another scenario or other factor related to our capital management process may result in materially lower capacity to return capital to shareholder than that indicated by the projection released in the ccar or dfast process this in turn could lead to restriction on our ability to pay dividend and engage in share repurchase transaction see part item business supervision and regulation for additional information operational riskwe face risk related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure our ability to retain and attract new customer depends on our ability to build or acquire necessary operational technological and organizational infrastructure or adapt to technological advance involving such infrastructure which can be challenge due to the fast pace of digital transformation and advance we are embedding technology data and software development deeply into our business model and how we work similar to other large corporation we are exposed to operational risk that can manifest in many way such error related to failed or inadequate process inaccurate model faulty or disabled computer system fraud by employee or person outside of our company and exposure to external event in addition we are heavily dependent on the security capability and continuous availability of the technology system that we use to manage our internal financial and other system interface with our customer and develop and implement effective marketing campaign in addition our business are dependent on our ability to process record and monitor large number of complex transaction if any of our financial accounting or other data processing system fail or have other significant shortcoming our business and

damage regulatory intervention and customer loss of confidence in our business any of which could result in material adverse effect we also rely on the business infrastructure and system of third party with which we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality for example we have migrated number of and intend to migrate substantially all of our core system and customer facing application to third party cloud infrastructure platform such amazon web service inc if we do not execute the transition or administer these

our cloud infrastructure provider or other service provider could experience system breakdown or failure outage downtime cyber attack adverse change to financial condition bankruptcy or other adverse condition which could have material adverse effect on our business and reputation thus the substantial amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to the cloud or to other third party may increase our risk exposure our ability to develop and deliver new product that meet the need of our existing customer and attract new one and to run our business in compliance with applicable law and

rely on information system and infrastructure including digital technology computer and email system software network and other web based technology that we and third party service provider operate we also have arrangement in place with third party through which we share and receive information about their customer who are or may become our customer like other financial service firm technology system network and device of capital one or our customer employee service provider or other third party with whom we interact continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access mishandling or misuse of information denial of service attack computer virus website defacement hacking malware ransomware phishing or other form of social engineering and other form of cyber attack designed to obtain confidential information destroy data disrupt or degrade service sabotage system or cause other damage and other event these threat may derive from human error fraud or malice on the part of our employee insider or third party or may result from accidental technological failure any of these party may also attempt to fraudulently induce employee customer or other third party user of our system to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customer or third party with whom we interact further cyber and information security risk for large financial institution like have generally increased in recent year in part because of the proliferation of new technology the use of the internet and telecommunication technology to conduct financial transaction and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime perpetrator of fraud hacker terrorist activist formal and informal instrumentality of foreign government and other external party in addition to access our product and service our customer may use computer smartphones tablet pc and other mobile device that are beyond our security control system financial institution we are subject to and examined for compliance with an array of data protection law regulation and guidance well to our own internal privacy and information security policy and program however because the method and technique employed by perpetrator of fraud and others to attack disable degrade or sabotage platform system and application change frequently are increasingly sophisticated and often are not fully recognized or understood until after they have occurred and some technique could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected we and our third party service provider and partner may be unable to anticipate or identify certain attack method in order to implement effective preventative measure or mitigate or remediate the damage caused in timely manner we may also be unable to hire and develop talent capable of detecting mitigating or remediating these risk although we believe we have robust suite of authentication and layered information security control including our cyber threat analytics data encryption and tokenization technology anti malware defense and vulnerability management program any one or combination of these control could fail to detect mitigate or remediate these risk in timely manner we may face an increasing number of attempted cyber attack we expand our one financial corporation cof table of contentsmobile and other internet based product and service well our usage of mobile and cloud technology and we provide more of these service to greater number of retail client disruption or breach including result of cyber attack or medium report of perceived security vulnerability at capital one or at third party service provider could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention remediation cost card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our system product and service that could adversely affect our business we and other financial service provider continue to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cybersecurity threat from sophisticated third party although we have not experienced any material loss relating to cyber incident there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber incident will not occur or that we will not suffer such loss in the future unauthorized access or cyber incident could occur more frequently and on more significant scale if future attack like these are successful or if customer are unable to access their account online for other reason it could adversely impact our ability to service customer account or loan complete financial transaction for our customer or otherwise operate any of our business or service in addition breach or attack affecting one of our third party service provider or partner could harm our business even if we do not control the service that is attacked in addition the increasing prevalence and the evolution of cyber attack and other effort to breach or disrupt our system or those of our partner retailer or other market participant ha led and will likely continue to lead to increased cost to with respect to preventing mitigating and remediating these risk well any related attempted fraud we may be required to expend significant additional resource to continue to modify or strengthen our protective security measure investigate and remediate any vulnerability of our information system and infrastructure or invest in new technology designed to mitigate security risk for example various retailer have continued to be victim of cyber attack in which customer data including debit and credit card information wa obtained in these situation we incur variety of cost including those associated with replacing the compromised card and remediating fraudulent transaction activity further successful cyber attack at other large financial institution or other market participant whether or not we are impacted could lead to general loss of customer confidence in financial institution that could negatively affect including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measure or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our financial product though we have insurance against some cyber risk and attack it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of material loss event our exposure to potential data protection and privacy incident and our required compliance with regulation related to these area may increase our cost reduce our revenue and limit our ability to pursue business opportunity if our information system or infrastructure or those of our customer partner service provider or other market participant experience significant disruption or breach it could lead depending on the nature of the disruption or breach to the unauthorized access to and release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of personal or confidential data about our customer employee or other third party in our possession any party that obtains this personal or confidential data through breach or disruption may use this information for ransom to be paid by or third party part of fraudulent activity that is part of broader criminal activity or for other illicit purpose further such disruption or breach could also result in unauthorized access to our proprietary information intellectual property software methodology and business secret and in unauthorized transaction in capital one account or unauthorized access to personal or confidential information maintained by those entity for example there ha been significant proliferation of consumer information available on the internet resulting from breach of third party entity including personal information log in credential and authentication data while capital one wa not directly involved in these third party breach event the stolen information can create vulnerability for our customer if their capital one log in credential are the same or similar to the credential that have been compromised on other site this vulnerability could include the risk of unauthorized account access data loss and fraud the use of automation software or bot can increase the velocity and efficacy of these type of attack data protection incident or medium report of perceived security vulnerability at capital one or at third party service provider could result in significant legal and financial exposure regulatory intervention remediation cost card reissuance supervisory liability damage to our reputation or loss of confidence in the security of our system product and service that could adversely affect our business we regularly move data across national border to conduct our operation and consequently are subject to variety of continuously evolving and developing law and regulation in the united state and abroad regarding privacy data protection and data security including those related to the collection storage handling use disclosure transfer and security of personal data significant uncertainty exists privacy and data protection law may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirement for example the gdpr which becomes effective in may extends the scope of the eu data protection law to all company processing data of eu resident regardless of the company location the law requires company to meet new requirement regarding the handling of personal data including new right such the portability of personal data our effort to comply with gdpr and other privacy and data protection law may entail substantial expense one financial corporation cof table of contentsmay divert resource from other initiative and project and could limit the service we are able to offer furthermore enforcement action and investigation by regulatory authority related to data security incident and privacy violation continue to increase the enactment of more restrictive law rule regulation or future enforcement action or investigation could impact through increased cost or restriction on our business and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalty and significant legal liability legal riskour business are subject to the risk of increased litigation government investigation and regulatory enforcement our business are subject to increased litigation government investigation and other regulatory enforcement risk result of number of factor and from various source including the highly regulated nature of the financial service industry the focus of state and federal prosecutor on bank and the financial service industry the structure of the credit card industry and business practice in the mortgage business given the inherent uncertainty involved in litigation government investigation and regulatory enforcement decision and the large or indeterminate damage sought in some matter asserted against there can be significant uncertainty to the ultimate liability we may incur from these kind of matter the finding or even the assertion of substantial legal liability against could have material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and could cause significant reputational harm to which could seriously harm our business in addition financial institution including have faced significant regulatory scrutiny over the past several year which ha increasingly led to public enforcement action we and our subsidiary are subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the federal reserve the sec occ fdic and cfpb we have been subject to enforcement action by many of these and other regulator and may continue to be involved in such action including governmental inquiry investigation and enforcement proceeding including by the department of justice and state attorney general we expect that regulator and governmental enforcement body will continue taking formal enforcement action against financial institution in addition to addressing supervisory concern through non public supervisory action or finding which could involve restriction on our activity among other limitation that could adversely affect our business in addition violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulator and other governmental agency of the same or similar practice by for example various regulatory and governmental agency initiated an industry wide supervisory initiative regarding sale practice and sale incentive compensation structure following public enforcement action at another financial institution in addition single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigation and proceeding these and other initiative from governmental authority and official may subject to further judgment settlement fine or penalty or cause to restructure our operation and activity or to cease offering certain product or service all of which could harm our reputation or lead to higher operational cost litigation government investigation and other regulatory action could involve restriction on our activity generally subject to significant fine increased expense restriction on our activity and damage to our reputation and our brand and could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation other business riskswe face intense competition in all of our market we operate in highly competitive environment whether in making loan attracting deposit or in the global payment industry and we expect competitive condition to continue to intensify with respect to most of our product we compete on the basis of the rate we pay on deposit and the rate and other term we charge on the loan we originate or purchase well the quality and range of our customer service product innovation and experience this increasingly competitive environment is primarily result of change in technology product delivery system and regulation well the emergence of new or significantly larger financial service provider all of which may affect our customer expectation and demand some of our competitor including new and emerging competitor in the digital and mobile payment space and other financial technology provider are not subject to the same regulatory requirement or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject which also could place at competitive disadvantage in particular in the development of new technology platform or the ability to rapidly innovate we compete with many form of payment offered by both bank and non bank provider including variety of new and evolving alternative payment mechanism system and product such aggregator and web based and wireless payment platform or technology digital currency prepaid system and payment service targeting user of social network and online gaming including for example those offering payment through mobile phone account if we are unable to continue to keep pace with innovation our business and result of operation could be adversely affected some of our competitor are substantially larger than we are which may give those competitor advantage including more diversified product and customer base the ability to reach out to more customer and potential customer operational efficiency one financial corporation cof table of contentsbroad based local distribution capability lower cost funding and larger existing branch network many of our competitor are also focusing on cross selling their product and developing new product or technology which could affect our ability to maintain or grow existing customer relationship or require to offer lower interest rate or fee on our lending product or higher interest rate on deposit price competition for loan might result in origination of fewer loan or earning le on our loan of december we operate the largest online direct bank in the by deposit while direct banking represents significant opportunity to attract new customer that value greater and more flexible access to banking service at reduced cost we face strong competition in the direct banking market aggressive pricing throughout the industry may adversely affect the retention of existing balance and the cost efficient acquisition of new deposit fund and may affect our growth and profitability in addition the effect of competitive environment may be exacerbated by the flexibility of direct banking and the increasing financial and technological sophistication of our customer base customer could also close their online account or reduce balance or deposit in favor of product and service offered by competitor for other reason these shift which could be rapid could result from general dissatisfaction with our product or service including concern over pricing online security or our reputation in our credit card business competition for reward customer may result in higher reward expense or we may fail to attract new customer or retain existing reward customer due to increasing competition for these consumer we have expanded our credit card partnership business over the past several year with the addition of number of credit card partnership the market for key business partner especially in the credit card business is very competitive and we may not be able to grow or maintain these partner relationship we face the risk that we could lose partner relationship even after we have invested significant resource time and expense into acquiring and developing the relationship the loss of any of our key business partner could have negative impact on our result of operation including lower return excess operating expense and excess funding capacity some of our competitor have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have may offer richer value proposition or wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategy to acquire and retain more customer capture greater share of spending and borrowing attain and develop more attractive cobrand card program and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat or respond or adapt to change in consumer spending habit effectively our competitor in such competitive environment we may lose entire account or may lose account balance to competing firm or we may find it more costly to maintain our existing customer base customer attrition from any or all of our lending product together with any lowering of interest rate or fee that we might implement to retain customer could reduce our revenue and therefore our earnings similarly unexpected customer attrition from our deposit product in addition to an increase in rate or service that we may offer to retain deposit may increase our expense and therefore reduce our earnings our business financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected by merchant increasing focus on the fee charged by credit card network and by regulation and legislation impacting such fee credit card interchange fee are generally one of the largest component of the cost that merchant pay in connection with the acceptance of credit card and are meaningful source of revenue for our credit card business interchange fee are the subject of significant and intense global legal regulatory and legislative focus and the resulting decision regulation and legislation may have material adverse impact on our overall business financial condition and result of operation regulator and legislative body in number of country are seeking to reduce credit card interchange fee through legislation competition related regulatory proceeding central bank regulation and or litigation interchange reimbursement rate in the united state are set by credit card network such mastercard and visa in some jurisdiction such canada and certain country in the european union interchange fee and related practice are subject to regulatory activity that have limited the ability of certain network to establish default rate including in some case imposing cap on permissible interchange fee we have already experienced these impact in our international credit card portfolio legislator and regulator around the world are aware of each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another such our primary market the united state in addition to this regulatory activity merchant are also seeking avenue to reduce interchange fee during the past year merchant and their trade group have filed numerous lawsuit against visa mastercard american express and their card issuing bank claiming that their practice toward merchant including interchange and similar fee violate federal antitrust law in number of entity filed antitrust lawsuit against mastercard and visa and several member bank including our subsidiary and alleging among other thing that the defendant conspired to fix the level of interchange fee in december the one financial corporation cof table of contentsdistrict court for the eastern district of new york granted final approval of the proposed class settlement the settlement provided among other thing that merchant would be entitled to join together to negotiate lower interchange fee the settlement wa appealed to the second circuit court of appeal which rejected the settlement in june this litigation remains ongoing see note commitment contingency guarantee and others for further detail some major retailer may have sufficient bargaining power to independently negotiate lower interchange fee with mastercard and visa which could in turn result in lower interchange fee for when our cardholder undertake purchase transaction with these retailer in some of the largest merchant individually negotiated lower interchange rate with mastercard and or visa these and other merchant also continue to lobby aggressively for cap and restriction on interchange fee and there can be no assurance that their effort will not be successful or that they will not in the future bring legal proceeding against or other credit card and debit card issuer and network beyond pursuing litigation legislation and regulation merchant may also promote form of payment with lower fee such ach based payment or seek to impose surcharge at the point of sale for use of credit or debit card new payment system particularly mobile based payment technology could also gain widespread adoption and lead to issuer transaction fee or the displacement of credit card account payment method the heightened focus by merchant and regulatory and legislative body on the fee charged by credit and debit card network and the ability of certain merchant to successfully negotiate discount to interchange fee with mastercard and visa or develop alternative payment system could result in reduction of interchange fee any resulting loss in income to could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation if we are not able to invest successfully in and introduce digital and other technological development across all our business our financial performance may suffer our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change and our ability to meet our customer need and expectation is key to our ability to grow revenue and earnings we expect digital technology to have significant impact on banking over time consumer increasingly expect robust digital experience from their financial service provider the ability for customer to access their account and conduct financial transaction using digital technology including mobile application is an increasingly important aspect of the financial service industry and it impact our ability to deliver product and service to our customer to that end financial institution are rapidly introducing new digital and other technology driven product and service which aim to offer better customer experience and to reduce cost we continue to invest in digital technology designed to attract new customer facilitate the ability of existing customer to conduct financial transaction and enhance the customer experience related to our product and service our continued success depends in part upon our ability to address the need of our customer by using digital technology to provide product and service that efficiently meet their expectation in cost effective manner the development and launch of new digital product and service depends in large part on our capacity to invest in and build the technology platform that can enable them we continue to actively invest in such technology platform however we may fail to implement the correct technology or may fail to do so in timely manner discussed in more detail above under the heading we face intense competition in all of our market and we face risk related to our operational technological and organizational infrastructure some of our competitor are substantially larger than we are which may allow those competitor to invest more money into their technology infrastructure and digital innovation than we do in addition we face intense competition from smaller company which experience lower cost structure and different regulatory requirement and scrutiny than we do and which may allow them to innovate more rapidly than we can see we face intense competition in all of our market further our success depends on our ability to attract and retain strong digital and technology leader engineer and other talent and competition for such talent is intense if we are unable to attract and retain digital and technology talent our ability to offer digital product and service and build the necessary technology infrastructure could be negatively affected which could negatively impact our business and financial result failure to maintain or enhance our competitive position with respect to digital product and service whether because we fail to anticipate customer expectation or because our technological development fail to perform desired or are not implemented in timely or successful manner could negatively impact our business and financial result we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefit of our merger acquisition and strategic partnership we have engaged in merger and acquisition activity and entered into strategic partnership over the past several year and may continue to engage in such activity in the future we continue to evaluate and anticipate engaging in among other merger and acquisition activity additional strategic partnership and selected acquisition of financial institution and other financial asset one financial corporation cof table of contentsincluding credit card and other loan portfolio there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and secure future acquisition target on term and condition that are acceptable to or successfully complete proposed merger acquisition and strategic partnership which could impair our growth any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we undertake entail certain risk which may materially and adversely affect our result of operation if we experience greater than anticipated cost to integrate acquired business into our existing operation or are not able to achieve the anticipated benefit of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership including cost saving and other synergy our business could be negatively affected in addition it is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of key employee error or delay in system implementation the disruption of our ongoing business or inconsistency in standard control procedure and policy that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationship with partner client customer depositor and employee or to achieve the anticipated benefit of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership integration effort also may divert management attention and resource these integration matter may have an adverse effect on during any transition period in addition we may face the following risk in connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership new business and geographic or other market our merger acquisition or strategic partnership activity may involve our entry into new business and new geographic area or other market which present risk resulting from our relative inexperience in these new business or market these new business or market may change the overall character of our consolidated portfolio of business and could react differently to economic and other external factor we face the risk that we will not be successful in these new business or in these new market identification and assessment of merger and acquisition target and deployment of acquired asset we can not assure you that we will identify or acquire suitable financial asset or institution to supplement our organic growth through acquisition or strategic partnership in addition we may incorrectly ass the asset quality and value of the particular asset or institution we acquire further our ability to achieve the anticipated benefit of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership will depend on our ability to ass the asset quality and value of the particular asset or institution we partner with merge with or acquire we may be unable to profitably deploy any asset we acquire accuracy of assumption in connection with any merger acquisition or strategic partnership we may make certain assumption relating to the proposed merger acquisition or strategic partnership that may be or may prove to be inaccurate including result of the failure to realize the expected benefit of any merger acquisition or strategic partnership the inaccuracy of any assumption we may make could result in unanticipated consequence that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation or financial condition target specific risk asset and company that we acquire or company that we enter into strategic partnership with will have their own risk that are specific to particular asset or company these risk include but are not limited to particular or specific regulatory accounting operational reputational and industry risk any of which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation or financial condition indemnification right if any may be insufficient to compensate for any loss or damage resulting from such risk in addition to regulatory approval discussed above certain of our merger acquisition or partnership activity may require third party consent in order for to fully realize the anticipated benefit of any such transaction condition to regulatory approval certain acquisition may not be consummated without obtaining approval from one or more of our regulator we can not be certain when or if or on what term and condition any required regulatory approval will be granted consequently we might be required to sell portion of acquired asset condition to receiving regulatory approval or we may not obtain regulatory approval for proposed acquisition on acceptable term or at all in which case we would not be able to complete the acquisition despite the time and expense invested in pursuing it reputational risk and social factor may impact our result and damage our brand our ability to originate and maintain account is highly dependent upon the perception of consumer and commercial borrower and deposit holder and other external perception of our business and compliance practice or our financial health in addition our brand ha historically been and we expect it to continue to be very important to maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide high quality product and service adverse perception regarding our reputation in the consumer commercial and funding market could lead to difficulty in generating and maintaining account well in financing them in particular negative public perception regarding our reputation could lead to decrease in the level of deposit that consumer and commercial customer and potential customer choose to maintain with or significantly increase one financial corporation cof table of contentsthe cost of attracting and retaining customer in addition negative perception regarding certain industry or client could also prompt to cease business activity associated with those industry or client negative public opinion or damage to our brand could also result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activity or circumstance including lending practice regulatory compliance security breach including the use and protection of customer information corporate governance and sale and marketing and from action taken by regulator or other person in response to such conduct such conduct could fall short of our customer and the public heightened expectation of company of our size with rigorous data privacy and compliance practice and could further harm our reputation in addition third party with whom we have important relationship may take action over which we have limited control that could negatively impact perception about or the financial service industry the proliferation of social medium may increase the likelihood that negative public opinion from any of the event discussed above will impact our reputation and business in addition variety of social factor may cause change in borrowing activity including credit card use payment pattern and the rate of default by accountholders and borrower domestically and internationally these social factor include change in consumer confidence level the public perception regarding the banking industry and consumer debt including credit card use and changing attitude about the stigma of bankruptcy if consumer develop or maintain negative attitude about incurring debt or if consumption trend decline or if we fail to maintain and enhance our brand or we incur significant expense in this effort our business and financial result could be materially and negatively affected if we are not able to protect our intellectual property our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on variety of measure to protect and enhance our intellectual property including copyright trademark trade secret patent and certain restriction on disclosure solicitation and competition we also undertake other measure to control access to and distribution of our other proprietary information these measure may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property right and resulting loss of competitive advantage in addition our competitor or other third party may file patent application for innovation that are used in our industry or allege that our system process or technology infringe on their intellectual property right if our competitor or other third party are successful in obtaining such patent or prevail in intellectual property related litigation against we could lose significant revenue incur significant license royalty or technology development expense or pay significant damage there are risk resulting from the extensive use of model and data in our business we rely on quantitative model and our ability to manage data and our ability to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner to ass and manage our various risk exposure and to estimate certain financial value model may be used in such process determining the pricing of various product grading loan and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risk predicting loss assessing capital adequacy and calculating economic and regulatory capital level well to estimate the value of financial instrument and balance sheet item our risk reporting and management including business decision based on information incorporating model depend on the effectiveness of our model and our policy program process and practice governing how data is acquired validated stored protected processed and analyzed any issue with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedure well the quality and integrity of data input could result in ineffective risk management practice or inaccurate risk reporting for example model based on historical data set might not be accurate predictor of future outcome and their ability to appropriately predict future outcome may degrade over time while we continuously update our policy program process and practice many of our data management and aggregation process are manual and subject to human error or system failure failure to manage data effectively and to aggregate data in an accurate and timely manner may limit our ability to manage current and emerging risk to produce accurate financial regulatory and operational reporting well to manage changing business need if our risk management framework prof ineffective we could suffer unexpected loss which could materially adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition also information we provide to the public or to our regulator based on poorly designed or implemented model could be inaccurate or misleading some of the decision that our regulator make including those related to capital distribution to our shareholder could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the model used to generate the relevant information is insufficient our risk management strategy may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environment or against all type of risk management of risk including market credit liquidity compliance and strategic risk requires among other thing policy and procedure to properly record and verify large number of transaction and event see md risk management for further detail we have devoted significant resource to developing our risk management policy and procedure and expect to continue one financial corporation cof table of contentsto do so in the future nonetheless our risk management strategy may not be fully effective in identifying and mitigating our risk exposure in all market environment or against all type of risk including risk that are unidentified or unanticipated even if our model for assessing risk are properly designed and implemented some of our method of managing risk are based upon our use of observed historical market behavior and management judgment these method may not accurately predict future exposure which could be significantly greater than the historical measure indicate for example market condition during the financial crisis involved unprecedented dislocation and highlight the limitation inherent in using historical information to manage risk in addition credit risk is inherent in the financial service business and result from among other thing extending credit to customer our ability to ass the creditworthiness of our customer may be impaired if the model and approach we use to select manage and underwrite our consumer and commercial customer become le predictive of future charge offs due for example to rapid change in the economy including the unemployment rate while we employ broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation technique those technique and the judgment that accompany their application can not anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the timing of such outcome for example our ability to implement our risk management strategy may be hindered by adverse change in the volatility or liquidity condition in certain market and result may limit our ability to distribute such risk for instance when we seek to syndicate exposure in bridge financing transaction we have underwritten we may therefore incur loss in the course of our risk management or investing activity change in consumer behavior and their adoption of digital technology may change retail distribution strategy and may adversely impact our investment in our bank premise and equipment and other retail distribution asset lead to increased expenditure and expose to additional risk we have significant investment in bank premise and equipment for our branch network and other branch banking asset including our banking center parcel of land held for the development of future banking center and our retail work force advance in technology such digital and mobile banking in branch self service technology proximity or remote payment technology well progressively changing customer preference for these other method of banking could decrease the value of our branch network or other retail distribution asset result we may need to further change our retail distribution strategy and close sell and or renovate additional branch or parcel of land held for development and restructure or reduce our remaining branch and work force these action could lead to loss on these asset or could adversely impact the carrying value of other long lived asset reduce our revenue increase our expenditure dilute our brand and or reduce customer demand for our product and service further to the extent that we change our retail distribution strategy and result expand into new business area we may face more competitor with more experience in the new business area and more established relationship with relevant customer regulator and industry participant which could adversely affect our ability to compete our competitor may also be subject to le burdensome regulation see we face intense competition in all our market fluctuation in market interest rate or volatility in the capital market could adversely affect our income and expense the value of asset and obligation our regulatory capital cost of capital or our liquidity like other financial institution our business may be sensitive to market interest rate movement and the performance of the capital market disruption uncertainty or volatility across the capital market could negatively impact market liquidity and limit our access to funding required to operate and grow our business in addition change in interest rate or in valuation in the debt or equity market could directly impact for example we borrow money from other institution and depositor which we use to make loan to customer and invest in debt security and other earning asset we earn interest on these loan and asset and pay interest on the money we borrow from institution and depositor the interest rate that we pay on the security we have issued are also influenced by among other thing applicable credit rating from recognized rating agency downgrade to any of these credit rating could affect our ability to access the capital market increase our borrowing cost and have negative impact on our result of operation increased charge offs rising london interbank offering rate libor and other event may cause our securitization transaction to amortize earlier than scheduled which could accelerate our need for additional funding from other source fluctuation in interest rate including change in the relationship between short term rate and long term rate and in the relationship between our funding basis rate and our lending basis rate may have negative impact on our net interest income and therefore our earnings one financial corporation cof table of contentsin addition interest rate fluctuation and competitor response to those change may affect the rate of customer prepayment for mortgage auto and other term loan and may affect the balance customer carry on their credit card although recent increase in interest rate may reduce prepayment risk debt service requirement for some of our borrower will increase which may adversely affect those borrower ability to pay contractually obligated this could result in additional delinquency or charge offs and negatively impact our result of operation these change can reduce the overall yield on our earning asset portfolio change in interest rate and competitor response to these change may also impact customer decision to maintain balance in the deposit account they have with an inability to attract or maintain deposit could materially affect our ability to fund our business and our liquidity position many other financial institution have increased their reliance on deposit funding and such we expect continued competition in the deposit market we can not predict how this competition will affect our cost if we are required to offer higher interest rate to attract or maintain deposit our funding cost will be adversely impacted change in valuation in the debt and equity market could have negative impact on the asset we hold in our investment portfolio such market change could also have negative impact on the valuation of asset for which we provide servicing finally the basel iii capital rule requires that most amount reported in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci including unrealized gain and loss on security designated available for sale be included in our regulatory capital calculation change in interest rate or market valuation that result in unrealized loss on component of aoci could therefore impact our regulatory capital ratio negatively result of recent regulatory and other legal proceeding action by regulator or law enforcement agency may result in change to the manner in which libor is determined or the establishment of alternative reference rate for floating rate debt uncertainty to the nature of potential change alternative reference rate or other reform may adversely affect the trading market for libor based security in addition any change in the method pursuant to which libor is determined may result in sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in libor if that were to occur the level of interest payment and the value of libor indexed debt may be affected uncertainty to the extent and manner of future change may adversely affect the current trading market for libor based security we ass our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on our earnings under various scenario that differ based on assumption about the direction and the magnitude of interest rate change we take risk mitigation action based on those assessment we face the risk that change in interest rate could materially reduce our net interest income and our earnings especially if actual condition turn out to be materially different than those we assumed see md market risk profile for additional information our business could be negatively affected if we are unable to attract retain and motivate skilled senior leader our success depends in large part on our ability to retain key senior leader and competition for such senior leader is intense the executive compensation provision of the dodd frank act and the regulation issued thereunder and any further legislation regulation or regulatory guidance restricting executive compensation may limit the type of compensation arrangement that we may enter into with our most senior leader and could have negative impact on our ability to attract retain and motivate such leader in support of our long term strategy these law and regulation may not apply in the same manner to all financial institution and we therefore may face more restriction than other institution and company with which we compete for talent these law and regulation may also hinder our ability to compete for talent with other industry if we are unable to retain talented senior leadership our business could be negatively affected we face risk from unpredictable catastrophic event despite the business contingency plan we have in place there can be no assurance that such plan will fully mitigate all potential business continuity risk to the impact from natural disaster and other catastrophic event may have negative effect on our business and infrastructure including our information technology system and those of third party that we rely on our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by disruption in the infrastructure that support our business and the community where we are located which are concentrated in the northern virginia and new york metropolitan area well richmond virginia and plano texas this may include disruption involving physical site access cyber incident terrorist activity disease pandemic catastrophic event natural disaster extreme weather event electrical outage environmental hazard computer server communication or other service we use our employee or third party with whom we conduct business in addition if natural disaster or other catastrophic event occurs in certain region where our business

accordance with applicable impairment accounting guidance this process requires significant management judgment and involves various estimate and assumption below we describe our process for assessing impairment of goodwill and intangible asset and the key estimate and assumption involved in this process one financial corporation cof table of contentsgoodwill and intangible assetsgoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any non controlling interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the net asset acquired and liability assumed of the acquisition date goodwill totaled billion of both december and intangible asset which we report on our consolidated balance sheet component of other asset consist primarily of purchased credit card relationship pccr core deposit and other intangible the net carrying amount of intangible asset decreased to million of december from million of december primarily due to amortization goodwill and intangible asset together represented of our total asset of both december and we did not recognize any goodwill impairment in or see note goodwill and intangible asset for additional information goodwillwe perform our goodwill impairment test annually on october at reporting unit level we are also required to test goodwill for impairment whenever event or circumstance make it more likely than not that impairment may have occurred in we had four reporting unit credit card auto other consumer banking and commercial banking the goodwill impairment test is two step process the first step involves comparison of the estimated fair value of reporting unit to it carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value exceeds it carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step is not necessary if the estimated fair value of reporting unit is below it carrying amount then the second step which requires measurement of any potential impairment must be performed the second step of goodwill impairment testing requires an extensive effort to build the specific reporting unit balance sheet for the test based on applicable accounting guidance for the purpose of our goodwill impairment testing we calculate the carrying amount of reporting unit using an allocated capital approach based on each reporting unit specific regulatory capital economic capital requirement and underlying risk the carrying amount for reporting unit is the sum of it respective capital requirement goodwill and intangible balance we then compare the carrying amount to our total consolidated stockholder equity to ass the reasonableness of our methodology the total carrying amount of our four reporting unit wa billion compared to consolidated stockholder equity of billion of october the billion excess in consolidated stockholder equity wa primarily attributable to capital allocated to our other category and other future capital need such dividend determining the fair value of reporting unit and the associated asset liability and intangible asset is subjective process that requires the use of estimate and the exercise of significant judgment the fair value of the reporting unit wa calculated using discounted cash flow dcf calculation form of the income approach this income approach calculation used projected cash flow based on each reporting unit internal forecast and the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal value our dcf analysis requires management to make estimate about future loan deposit and revenue growth well credit loss and capital rate these cash flow and terminal value were then discounted using discount rate based on our external cost of equity with adjustment for the risk inherent in each reporting unit the reasonableness of the dcf approach wa assessed by reference to market based approach using comparable market multiple and recent market transaction where available the result of the annual impairment test for the credit card auto other consumer banking and commercial banking reporting unit indicated that the estimated fair value of these four reporting unit substantially exceeded their carrying amount by definition assumption used in estimating the fair value of reporting unit are judgmental and inherently uncertain significant change in the economic condition of reporting unit such decline in business performance increase in credit loss increase in capital requirement deterioration in market condition adverse estimate of regulatory or legislative change or increase in the estimated cost of equity could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting unit to decline in the future and increase the risk of goodwill impairment charge to earnings in future period one financial corporation cof table of contentsintangible assetsintangible asset with definitive useful life are amortized over their estimated life and evaluated for potential impairment whenever event or change in circumstance suggest that an asset or asset group carrying amount may not be fully recoverable an impairment loss generally calculated the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying amount of an asset or asset group is recognized if the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flow relating to the asset or asset group is le than the corresponding carrying amount there wa no meaningful impairment of intangible asset in or we recorded an impairment charge of million in related primarily to our brokerage relationship intangible see note goodwill and intangible asset for additional information fair valuefair value also referred to an exit price is defined the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant on the measurement date the fair value accounting guidance provides three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instrument this hierarchy is based on the market in which the asset or liability trade and whether the input to the valuation technique used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable fair value measurement of financial asset or liability is assigned level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety the three level of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liabilitieslevel observable market based input other than quoted price in active market for identical asset or liabilitieslevel unobservable inputsthe degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted price in active market or observable market parameter when quoted price and observable data in active market are not fully available management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value change in market condition such reduced liquidity in the capital market or change in secondary market activity may reduce the availability and reliability of quoted price or observable data used to determine fair value we have developed policy and procedure to determine when market for our financial asset and liability are inactive if the level and volume of activity ha declined significantly relative to normal condition if market are determined to be inactive it may be appropriate to adjust price quote received when significant adjustment are required to price quote or input it may be appropriate to utilize an estimate based primarily on unobservable input significant judgment may be required to determine whether certain financial instrument measured at fair value are classified level or level in making this determination we consider all available information that market participant use to measure the fair value of the financial instrument including observable market data indication of market liquidity and orderliness and our understanding of the valuation technique and significant input used based upon the specific fact and circumstance of each instrument or instrument category judgment are made regarding the significance of the level input to the instrument fair value measurement in it entirety if level input are considered significant the instrument is classified level the process for determining fair value using unobservable input is generally more subjective and involves high degree of management judgment and assumption we discus change in the valuation input and assumption used in determining the fair value of our financial instrument including the extent to which we have relied on significant unobservable input to estimate fair value and our process for corroborating these input in note fair value measurement fair value measurementwe have governance framework and number of key control that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurement are appropriate and reliable our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duty our control process include review and approval of new transaction type price verification and review of valuation judgment method model process control and result group independent of our trading and investing function participate in the review and validation process task performed by these group include periodic verification of fair value measurement to determine if assigned fair value are reasonable including comparing price from vendor pricing service to other available market information one financial corporation cof table of contentsour fair value committee fvc which includes representation from business area risk management and finance division provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment the fvc regularly review and approves our fair valuation to ensure that our valuation practice are consistent with industry standard and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance we have model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of model and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of model for pricing and fair value measurement the model risk office validates all model and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance the fair value governance process is set up in manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation dispute that can not be resolved by the fvc to more senior committee called the valuation advisory committee vac for resolution the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other member of senior management the vac is only required to convene to review escalated valuation dispute customer reward reservewe offer product primarily credit card which include program that allow member to earn reward that can be redeemed for cash primarily in the form of statement credit gift card airline ticket or merchandise based on account activity the amount of reward that customer earns varies based on the term and condition of the reward program and product the majority of our reward do not expire and there is no limit on the amount of reward an eligible card member can earn customer reward cost which we generally record an offset to interchange income are driven by various factor such card member purchase volume the term and condition of the reward program and reward redemption cost we establish customer reward reserve that reflects management judgment regarding reward earned that are expected to be redeemed and the estimated redemption cost we use financial model to estimate ultimate redemption rate of reward earned to date by current card member based on historical redemption trend current enrollee redemption behavior card product type year of program enrollment enrollment tenure and card spend level our current assumption is that the vast majority of all reward earned will eventually be redeemed we use weighted average redemption cost during the previous twelve month adjusted appropriate for recent change in redemption cost including mix of reward redeemed to estimate future redemption cost we continually evaluate our reserve and assumption based on development in redemption pattern change to the term and condition of the reward program and other factor change in the ultimate redemption rate and weighted average redemption cost have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the reserve through the current period provision by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all reward earned but not yet redeemed by card member of the end of the reporting period we recognized customer reward expense of billion billion and billion in and respectively our customer reward liability

publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of the market risk rule supplement both the basel iii standardized approach and the basel iii advanced approach by

defense risk management model to demonstrate and structure the role responsibility and accountability in the organization for taking and managing risk the first line of defense is comprised of the business area that through their day to day business activity take risk on our behalf the business owner the first line is responsible for identifying assessing managing and controlling that risk this principle place ultimate accountability for the management of risk and ownership of risk decision with the ceo and business head the second line of defense provides oversight of first line risk taking and management and is primarily comprised of our risk management organization the second line assist in determining risk appetite and the strategy policy and structure for managing risk the second

establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control including standard of conduct and the integrity and ethical value of the company management reinforces expectation at the various level of the organization this portion of the framework set the foundation for the method for governing risk taking the interaction within and among the line of defense and the risk appetite and tolerance limit for risk taking identify and ass risk and ownershipidentifying and assessing risk and ownership is the beginning of the more detailed day to day process of managing risk this portion of the framework clarifies the importance of strong first line management and accountability for identifying and assessing risk while specifying the role of the second line to identify and ass risk particularly when taking on new initiative develop and operate control monitoring and mitigation planswe develop operate and monitor control to manage risk within tolerance level the first line develops control to oversee and manage identified risk control may prevent risk from occurring or measure the amount of risk being taken so that the amount may be proactively managed whenever possible plan are implemented to mitigate risk or reduce them to lower level the first line lead mitigation control and monitoring action the second line is consultant on control design when needed test and detect control gap and perform corrective actionwhile the first line is principally accountable for taking controlling and monitoring risk the second line oversees and monitor first line risk taking including the effectiveness of first line control and the third line independently test and oversees first and second line risk taking these activity provide the second and third line of defense with the ability to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized or unplanned risk taking within the organization control gap are closed by first line corrective action escalate key risk and gap to executive management and when appropriate the board of directorsescalation is an important component of our risk framework use of escalation is encouraged and doe not necessarily indicate failure on the part of first second or third line risk management through escalation in the first line decision requiring judgment can be raised to executive who have the broadest possible context and experience to make challenging decision escalation in the second and third line of defense can also demonstrate part of their core responsibility of effective challenge if appropriate risk are escalated to the board of director to ensure alignment with the most material risk decision and or transparency to the largest risk facing the organization calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement process including stress testing capital ultimately is held to protect the company from unforeseen risk or unexpected risk severity such it is important that capital planning process be well linked with risk management practice to ensure the appropriate capital protection are in place for the safety and soundness of the company stress testing and economic capital measurement both of which incorporate input from across the risk spectrum are key tool for evaluating our capital position and risk adjusted return support with the right culture talent and skillsthe right culture talent

card loan portfolio change in delinquency rate can provide an early warning of change in credit loss the primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolio is our internal risk rating because we generally classify loan that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loan with significant risk of loss nonperforming the level of nonperforming asset represents another indicator of the potential for future credit loss in addition to delinquency rate the geographic distribution of our loan provides insight to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic

risk management activity discussed below interest rate riskinterest rate risk which represents exposure to instrument whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rate is our most significant source of market risk exposure bank are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to difference in the timing between the maturity or re pricing of asset and liability foreign exchange riskforeign exchange risk represents exposure to change in the value of current holding and future cash flow denominated in other currency our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operation of our international business in the and canada the largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operation is the funding they are provided in the great british pound gbp and the canadian dollar cad respectively we also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investment in these operation and through the dollar denominated value of future earnings and cash flow they generate one financial corporation cof table of contentsour intercompany funding expose our consolidated statement of income to foreign exchange transaction risk while our equity investment in our foreign operation result in translation risk exposure in our aoci and capital ratio we manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contract to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flow related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowing we use foreign currency derivative contract net investment hedge to manage our aoci exposure we apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedge and our net investment hedge with the primary net investment subject to hedging denominated in gbp we measure our total exposure from non dollar denominated intercompany borrowing to our international business by regularly tracking the value of the loan made to our foreign operation and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contract we use to hedge them we apply dollar appreciation shock against these exposure to measure the impact to our consolidated statement of income from foreign exchange transaction risk the intercompany borrowing to our international business were million gbp and million gbp of december and respectively and billion cad and billion cad of december and respectively we measure our total exposure in non dollar denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operation the largest of which is in our and canadian operation our measurement of net

foreign exchange rate and commodity derivative an accommodation to customer within our commercial banking business and offset the majority of these exposure through derivative transaction with other counterparties these exposure are measured and monitored on daily basis result of offsetting our customer exposure with other counterparties we believe our net exposure to customer related trading risk is minimal we employ value at risk var the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer related trading activity var is statistical based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movement in normal market environment we employ historical simulation approach using the most recent business day and use percent confidence level and holding period of one business day we use internal model to produce daily var measure of the market risk of all customer related trading exposure for further information on our customer related

derivative are the primary tool that we use for managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk use of derivative is included in our current market risk management policy we execute our derivative contract in both over the counter otc and exchange traded derivative market and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties although the majority of our derivative are interest rate swap we also use variety of other derivative instrument including cap floor option future and forward contract to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk the outstanding notional

reflect all aspect of market risk we use various industry standard market risk measurement technique and analysis to measure ass and manage the impact of change in interest rate on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of change in foreign exchange rate on our non dollar denominated earnings and non dollar equity investment in foreign operation we provide additional information below in economic value of equity we consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk due to the increase in interest rate since december we have incorporated basis point decline scenario into our interest rate sensitivity analysis we use this basis point decrease our largest magnitude declining interest rate scenario since scenario where interest rate would decline by basis point is unlikely in scenario where basis point decline would result in rate le than we assume rate of below we discus the assumption used in calculating each of these measure net interest income sensitivitythis sensitivity measure estimate the impact on our projected month baseline interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movement in interest rate interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain component of other non interest income significantly impacted by movement in interest rate including change in the fair value of mortgage servicing right and free standing interest rate swap adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and change in the fair value of mortgage servicing right including related derivative hedging activity and change in the fair value of free standing interest rate swap in addition to our existing asset and liability we incorporate expected future business growth assumption such loan and deposit growth and pricing and plan for projected change in our funding mix in our baseline forecast in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movement on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue we assume hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rate of basis point basis point basis point basis point and basis point to spot rate with the lower rate scenario limited to zero described above at the current level of interest rate our net interest income remains mostly unchanged in the and basis point scenario and decrease slightly in the and basis point scenario economic value of equityour economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimate the impact on the net present value of our asset and liability including derivative hedging activity resulting from movement in interest rate our economic value of equity sensitivity measure are calculated based on our existing asset and liability including derivative and do not incorporate business growth assumption or projected plan for funding mix change in measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movement on our economic value of equity we assume hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rate of basis point basis point basis point basis point and basis point to spot rate with the lower rate scenario limited to zero described above calculating our economic value of equity and it sensitivity to interest rate requires projecting cash flow for asset liability and derivative instrument and discounting those cash flow at the appropriate discount rate key assumption in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayment for mortgage security loan and other asset term

acquisition if any into our business segment and the allocation methodology and accounting policy used to derive our business segment result in note business segment basis of presentation and use of estimatesthe accompanying consolidated financial statement have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the gaap the preparation of financial statement in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and in the related disclosure these estimate are based on information available of the date of the consolidated financial statement while management make it best judgment actual amount or result could differ from these estimate certain prior period amount have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statement include the account of capital one financial corporation and all other entity in which we have controlling financial interest we determine whether we have controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is voting interest entity or variable interest entity vie all significant intercompany account balance and transaction have been eliminated voting interest entity voting interest entity are entity that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investor voting right that give them the power to make significant decision relating to the entity operation since controlling financial interest in an entity is typically obtained through ownership of majority voting interest we consolidate our majority owned subsidiary and other voting interest entity in which we hold directly or indirectly more than of the voting right or where we exercise control through other contractual right investment in entity where we do not have controlling financial interest but we have significant influence over the entity financial and operating decision generally defined owning voting interest of to are accounted for under the equity method if we own le than of voting interest entity we generally carry the investment at cost

our share of income or loss on equity method investment and dividend on cost method investment in other non interest income in our consolidated statement of income variable interest entitiesvies are entity that by design either lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance it activity without additional subordinated financial support from other party or ii have equity investor that do not have the ability to make significant decision relating to the entity operation through voting right or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected loss or do not have the right to receive the residual return of the entity the entity that ha controlling financial interest in vie is referred to the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the vie an entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of vie if that entity ha both the power to direct the activity of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb loss or the right to receive benefit that could potentially be significant to the vie in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of vie we consider both qualitative and quantitative factor regarding the nature size and form of our involvement with the vie such our role in establishing the vie and our ongoing right and responsibility our economic interest including debt and equity investment servicing fee and other arrangement deemed to be variable interest in the vie the design of the vie including the capitalization structure subordination of interest payment priority relative share of interest held across various class within the vie capital structure and the reason the interest are held by we perform on going reassessment to evaluate whether change in an entity capital structure or change in the nature of our involvement with the entity result in change to the vie designation or change to our consolidation conclusion see note variable interest entity and securitizations for

maturity of three month or le when acquired security resale and repurchase agreement security purchased under resale agreement and security loaned or sold under agreement to repurchase principally government and agency obligation are not accounted for sale but collateralized financing transaction and recorded at the amount at which the security were acquired or sold plus accrued interest we

consists primarily of the following treasury security government sponsored enterprise or agency agency and non agency residential mortgage backed security rmbs agency commercial mortgage backed security cmb other asset backed security ab and other security the accounting and measurement framework for our investment security differs depending on the security classification we classify security available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management assessment of our intent and ability to hold the security until maturity security that we may sell prior to maturity in response to change in our investment strategy liquidity need interest rate risk profile or for other reason are classified available for sale security that we have the intent and

security prior to recovery of it amortized cost basis the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and it fair value is recognized in our consolidated statement of income we regularly evaluate our security whose value have declined below amortized cost to ass whether the decline in fair value represents an otti amortized cost reflects historical cost adjusted for amortization of premium accretion of discount and any previously recorded impairment we discus our assessment and accounting for otti in note investment security we discus the technique we use in determining the fair value of our investment security in note fair value measurement our investment portfolio also includes certain acquired debt security that were deemed to be credit impaired at the acquisition date and therefore are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for purchased credit impaired pci loan and debt security these security are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date using the estimated cash flow we expect to collect discounted by the prevailing market interest rate the difference between the contractually required payment due and the undiscounted cash flow we expect to collect at acquisition considering the impact of prepayment is referred to the nonaccretable difference the nonaccretable difference reflects estimated future credit loss expected to be incurred over the life of the security and is neither accreted into income recorded on our consolidated balance sheet the excess of the undiscounted cash flow expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of credit impaired debt security at acquisition is referred to the accretable yield which is accreted into interest income using an effective yield method over the remaining life of the security decrease in expected cash flow attributable to credit result in the recognition of otti significant increase in expected cash flow are recognized prospectively over the remaining life of the security an adjustment to the accretable yield see loan acquired section of this note for further discussion of accounting guidance for purchased credit impaired loan and debt security loansour loan portfolio consists of loan held for investment including loan underlying our consolidated securitization trust and loan held for sale and is divided into three portfolio segment credit card consumer banking and commercial banking loan credit card loan consist of domestic and international credit card loan consumer banking loan consist of auto home and retail banking loan commercial banking loan consist of commercial and multifamily real estate commercial and industrial and small ticket commercial real estate loan loan classification upon origination or purchase we classify loan held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management intent and ability with regard to the loan which may change over time the accounting and measurement framework for loan differs depending on the loan classification whether the loan are originated or purchased and whether purchased loan are considered credit impaired at the date of acquisition the presentation within the consolidated statement of cash flow is based on management intent at acquisition or origination cash flow related to loan held for investment are included in cash flow from investing activity on our consolidated statement of cash flow cash flow related to loan held for sale are included in cash flow from operating activity on our consolidated statement of cash flow loan

any unearned income unamortized deferred fee and cost unamortized premium and discount and charge offs credit card loan also include billed finance charge and fee net of the estimated uncollectible amount interest income is recognized on performing loan held for investment on an accrual basis we generally defer loan origination fee and direct loan origination cost on originated loan premium and discount on purchased loan and loan commitment fee we recognize these amount in interest income yield adjustment over the life of the loan and or commitment period using the effective interest method for credit card loan loan origination fee and direct loan origination cost are amortized on straight one financial corporation cof table of contentscapital one financial corporationnotes to

originated with the intent to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified held for sale interest on these loan is recognized on an accrual basis these loan are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value loan origination fee and direct loan origination cost are deferred until the loan is sold and are then recognized part of the total gain or loss on sale the fair value of loan held for sale is determined on an aggregate portfolio basis for each loan type if loan is transferred from held for investment to held for sale on the transfer date any decline in fair value related to credit is recorded charge off and amortization of deferred loan origination fee and cost cease subsequent to transfer we report write down or recovery in fair value up to the carrying value at the date of transfer and realized gain or loss on loan held for sale in our consolidated statement of income component of other non interest income we calculate the gain or loss on loan sale the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loan sold net of the fair value of any residual interest retained loan acquiredall purchased loan including loan transferred in business combination are initially recorded at fair value which includes consideration of expected future loss of the date of the acquisition we account for purchased loan under the accounting guidance for purchased credit impaired loan and debt security which is based upon expected cash flow if the purchased loan have discount attributable at least in part to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of the guidance we refer to these purchased loan that are subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flow to be collected pci loan other purchased loan that do not meet the criterion described above or are specifically scoped out of this guidance are accounted for based on contractual cash flow loan acquired and accounted for based on expected cash flowsin accounting for purchased loan based on expected cash flow we first determine the contractually required payment due which represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payment adjusted for the effect of estimated prepayment we then estimate the undiscounted cash flow we expect to collect incorporating several key assumption including expected default rate loss severity and the amount and timing of prepayment we estimate the fair value by discounting the estimated cash flow we expect to collect using an observable market rate of interest when available adjusted for factor that market participant would consider in determining fair value at acquisition we may aggregate loan acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pool if the loan have common risk characteristic pool is then accounted for single asset with single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flow the excess of cash flow expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loan is referred to the accretable yield this amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet but is accreted into interest income over the life of the loan or pool of loan using the effective interest method the difference between total contractual payment on the loan and all expected cash flow represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible subsequent to acquisition we evaluate our estimate of cash flow expected to be collected on quarterly basis these evaluation require the use of key assumption and estimate similar to those used in estimating the initial fair value at acquisition subsequent change in the estimated cash flow expected to be collected may result in change in the accretable yield and nonaccretable difference or reclassification from the nonaccretable difference to the accretable yield decrease in expected cash flow resulting from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit loss and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease loss charge offs are not recorded until the expected credit loss within the nonaccretable difference are depleted in addition pci loan are not classified delinquent nonperforming or criticized we expect to collect our net investment in these loan increase in the cash flow expected to be collected would first reduce any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease loss established subsequent to acquisition the excess over the recorded allowance for loan and lease loss would result in reclassification to the accretable yield from the nonaccretable difference and an increase in interest income recognized over the remaining life of the loan or pool of loan disposal of loan in the form of one financial corporation cof table of contentscapital one

combination we estimate discounted contractual cash flow due using an observable market rate of interest when available adjusted for factor that market participant would consider in determining fair

contractual cash flow is recorded loan discount or premium at acquisition subsequent to acquisition the loan are classified and accounted for either held for investment or held for sale based on management ability and intent with regard to the loan loan held for investment are subject to our allowance for loan and lease loss methodology described below under allowance for loan and lease loss we are permitted to aggregate loan acquired in the same fiscal quarter into one or more pool if the loan have common risk characteristic if we elect to pool loan pool is then accounted for single asset with single composite interest rate and an aggregate fair value and expected cash flow loan modification and restructurings part of our loss mitigation effort we may provide modification to borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral loan modification in which concession is granted to borrower experiencing financial difficulty is accounted for and reported troubled debt restructuring tdr our loan modification typically include an extension of the loan term reduction in the interest rate reduction in the loan balance or combination of these concession we describe our accounting for and measurement of impairment on tdr loan below under impaired loan see note loan for additional information on our loan modification and restructurings delinquent and nonperforming loansthe entire balance of loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer billing statement delinquency is reported on loan that are or more day past due interest and fee continue to accrue on past due loan until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status if applicable we generally place loan on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured nonperforming loan generally include loan that have been placed on nonaccrual status but we do not report loan classified held for sale nonperforming our policy for classifying loan nonperforming by loan category are follows credit card loan permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the federal financial institution examination council ffiec our policy is generally to exempt credit card loan from being classified nonperforming these loan are generally charged off in the period the account becomes day past due consistent with industry convention we generally continue to accrue interest and fee on delinquent credit card loan until the loan are charged off consumer banking loan we classify consumer banking loan nonperforming when we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured generally when the loan becomes day past due commercial banking loan we classify commercial banking loan nonperforming of the date we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured modified loan and troubled debt restructurings modified loan including tdrs that are current at the time of the restructuring remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified term is expected otherwise the modified loan is classified nonperforming and placed on nonaccrual status until the borrower demonstrates sustained period of performance over several payment cycle generally six month of consecutive payment under the modified term of the loan pci loan pci loan are not classified delinquent nonperforming or criticized one financial corporation cof table of contentscapital one financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statementsinterest and fee accrued but not collected at the date loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings in addition the amortization of net deferred loan fee is suspended interest and fee income is subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payment however if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal all cash received is generally applied against the principal balance of the loan nonaccrual loan are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful impaired loansa loan is considered impaired when based on current information and event it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amount due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual term of the loan generally we report loan impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance loan held for sale are not reported impaired these loan are recorded at lower of cost or fair value impaired loan also exclude pci loan these loan are accounted for based on expected cash flow at acquisition because this accounting methodology take into consideration future credit loss loan defined individually impaired based on applicable accounting guidance include larger balance nonperforming loan and tdr loan loan modified in tdr continue to be reported impaired until maturity our policy for identifying loan individually impaired by loan category are follows credit card loan credit card loan that have been modified in troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for individually impaired consumer banking loan consumer loan that have been modified in troubled debt restructuring are identified and accounted for individually impaired commercial banking loan commercial loan classified nonperforming and commercial loan that have been modified in troubled debt restructuring are reported individually impaired the majority of individually impaired loan are evaluated for an asset specific allowance we generally measure impairment and the related asset specific allowance for individually impaired loan based on the difference between the recorded investment of the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan at the time of modification if the loan is collateral dependent we measure impairment based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral which we determine based on the current fair value of the collateral le estimated selling cost instead of discounted cash flow loan are identified collateral dependent if we believe that collateral is the sole source of repayment charge offswe charge off loan reduction to the allowance for loan and lease loss when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recovery of previously charged off amount an increase to the allowance for loan and lease loss we exclude accrued and unpaid finance charge and fee and certain fraud loss from charge offs cost to recover charged off loan are recorded collection expense and included in our consolidated statement of income component of other non interest expense incurred our charge off time frame by loan type are presented below credit card loan we generally charge off credit card loan in the period the account becomes day past due we charge off delinquent credit card loan for which revolving privilege have been revoked part of loan workout when the account becomes day past due credit card loan in bankruptcy are generally charged off by the end of the month following day after the receipt of complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court credit card loan of deceased account holder are charged off by the end of the month following day of receipt of notification consumer banking loan we generally charge off consumer banking loan at the earlier of the date when the account is specified number of day past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral our charge off time frame is day for home loan and day for auto loan small business banking loan generally charge off at day past due based on when unpaid principal loan amount are deemed uncollectible we calculate the initial charge off amount for home loan based on the excess of our recorded investment in the loan over the fair value of the underlying property le estimated selling cost of the date of the charge off we update our home value estimate on regular basis and may recognize additional charge offs for subsequent decline in home value in the second quarter of due to clarified regulatory one financial corporation cof table of contentscapital one financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statementsguidance we implemented change in accounting estimate for auto and home loan where the borrower ha filed for bankruptcy and the loan ha not been reaffirmed such that they charge off in the period that the loan is day from the bankruptcy notification date regardless of delinquency status auto and home loan that have been discharged under chapter bankruptcy have not been reaffirmed and have not reached day from the bankruptcy notification date are charged off at the end of the month in which the bankruptcy discharge occurs remaining consumer loan generally are charged off within day of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court consumer loan of deceased account holder are charged off by the end of the month following day of receipt of notification commercial banking loan we charge off commercial loan in the period we determine that the unpaid principal loan amount are uncollectible pci loan we do not record charge offs on pci loan that are meeting or exceeding our performance expectation of the date of acquisition the fair value of these loan already reflect discount for expected future credit loss we record charge offs on pci loan only if actual loss exceed estimated credit loss incorporated into the fair value recorded at acquisition allowance for loan and lease loss we maintain an allowance for loan and lease loss allowance that represents management best estimate of incurred loan and lease loss inherent in our held for investment portfolio of each balance sheet date the provision for credit loss reflects credit loss we believe have been incurred and will eventually be recognized over time in our charge offs charge offs of uncollectible amount are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recovery are added back management performs quarterly analysis of our loan portfolio to determine if impairment ha occurred and to ass the adequacy of the allowance based on historical and current trend well other factor affecting credit loss we apply documented systematic methodology to separately calculate the allowance for our consumer loan and commercial loan portfolio our allowance for loan and lease loss consists of three component that are allocated to cover the estimated probable loss in each loan portfolio based on the result of our detailed review and loan impairment assessment process component for loan collectively evaluated for impairment ii an asset specific component for individually impaired loan and iii component related to pci loan that have experienced significant decrease in expected cash flow subsequent to acquisition each of our allowance component is supplemented by an amount that represents management qualitative judgment of the imprecision and risk inherent in the process and assumption used in establishing the allowance management judgment involves an assessment of subjective factor such process risk modeling assumption and adjustment risk and probable internal and external event that will likely impact loss our consumer loan portfolio consists of smaller balance homogeneous loan divided into four primary portfolio segment credit card loan auto loan residential home loan and retail banking loan each of these portfolio is further divided by our business unit into pool based on common risk characteristic such origination year contract type interest rate and geography which are collectively evaluated for impairment the commercial loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger balance non homogeneous loan these loan are subject to individual review that result in internal risk rating in assessing the risk rating of particular loan among the factor we consider are the financial condition of the borrower geography collateral performance historical loss experience and industry specific information that management belief is relevant in determining the occurrence of loss event and measuring impairment these factor are based on an evaluation of historical and current information and involve subjective assessment and interpretation emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factor could impact the risk rating assigned to that loan the component of the allowance related to credit card and other consumer loan that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on statistical calculation which is supplemented by management judgment described above because of the homogeneous nature of our consumer loan portfolio the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluation the allowance is established through process that begin with estimate of incurred loss in each pool based upon various statistical analysis loss forecast model are utilized to estimate probable loss incurred and consider several portfolio indicator including but not limited to historical loss experience account seasoning the value of collateral underlying secured loan estimated foreclosure or default based on observable trend delinquency bankruptcy filing unemployment credit bureau score and general economic and business trend management belief these factor are relevant in estimating probable loss incurred and also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicator such change in our credit evaluation underwriting and collection one financial corporation cof table of contentscapital one financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statementsmanagement policy the effect of other external factor such competition and legal and regulatory requirement general economic condition and business trend and uncertainty in forecasting and modeling technique used in estimating our allowance we update our consumer loss forecast model and portfolio indicator on quarterly basis to incorporate information reflective of the current economic environment the component of the allowance for commercial loan that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on our historical loss experience for loan with similar risk characteristic and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio which is supplemented by management judgment described above we apply internal risk rating to commercial loan which we use to ass credit quality and derive total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default default rate and loss given default loss severity management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factor derived taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factor including general economic condition industry specific and geographic trend portfolio concentration trend in internal credit quality indicator and current and past underwriting standard that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimate the asset specific component of the allowance cover smaller balance homogeneous consumer loan whose term have been modified in tdr and larger balance nonperforming non homogeneous commercial loan discussed above under impaired loan we generally measure the asset specific component of the allowance based on the difference between the recorded investment of individually impaired loan and the present value of expected future cash flow when the present value of expected future cash flow is lower than the recorded investment of the loan impairment is recognized through the provision for credit loss if the loan is collateral dependent we measure impairment based on the current fair value of the collateral le estimated selling cost instead of discounted cash flow the asset specific component of the allowance for smaller balance impaired loan is calculated on pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of asset the asset specific component of the allowance for larger balance impaired loan is individually calculated for each loan key consideration in determining the allowance include the borrower overall financial condition resource and payment history prospect for support from financially responsible guarantor and when applicable the estimated realizable value of any collateral we record all purchased loan at fair value at acquisition applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowance in the initial accounting for impaired loan acquired in transfer subsequent to acquisition decrease in expected principal cash flow of pci loan would trigger the recognition of impairment through our provision for credit loss subsequent increase in expected cash flow would first result in recovery of any previously recorded allowance to the extent applicable and then increase the accretable yield write down on pci loan in excess of the nonaccretable difference are charged against the allowance for loan and lease loss see note loan for information on loan portfolio associated with acquisition in addition to the allowance we also estimate probable loss related to contractually binding unfunded lending commitment such letter of credit financial guarantee and binding unfunded loan commitment the provision for unfunded lending commitment is included in the provision for credit loss in our consolidated statement of income and the related reserve is included in other liability on our consolidated balance sheet unfunded lending commitment are subject to individual review and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale which we use to ass credit quality and derive total loss estimate we ass these risk classification taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factor including historical loss experience utilization assumption current economic condition performance trend within specific portfolio segment and other pertinent information to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitment determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain subsequent evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of the factor then prevailing may result in significant change in the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitment in future period securitization of loansour loan securitization activity primarily involve the securitization of credit card loan which have provided source of funding for see note variable interest entity and securitizations for additional detail loan securitization involves the transfer of pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to trust the trust then sell an undivided interest in the pool of loan receivables to third party investor through the issuance of debt security and transfer the proceeds from the debt issuance to consideration for the loan receivables transferred the debt security are collateralized by the transferred receivables from our portfolio we remove loan from our consolidated balance sheet when securitizations

table of contentscapital one financial corporationnotes to consolidated financial statementsnote fair value measurementfair value also referred to an exit price is defined the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant on the measurement date the fair value accounting guidance provides three level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instrument this hierarchy is based on the market in which the asset or liability trade and whether the input to the valuation technique used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable the fair value measurement of financial asset or liability is assigned level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in it entirety the three level of the fair value hierarchy are described below level valuation is based on quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability level valuation is based on observable market based input other than quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability quoted price in market that are not active or model using input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the asset or liability level valuation is generated from technique that use significant assumption not observable in the market valuation technique include pricing model discounted cash flow methodology or similar technique the accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires that we maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input in determining fair value the accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect on contract by contract basis to measure certain financial asset and liability at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent change in fair value in earnings we have not made any material fair value option election of or for the period disclosed herein fair value governance and controlwe have governance framework and number of key control that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurement are appropriate and reliable our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duty our control process include review and approval of new transaction type price verification and review of valuation judgment method model process control and result group independent of our trading and investing function participate in the review and validation process task performed by these group include periodic verification of fair value measurement to determine if assigned fair value are reasonable including comparing price from vendor pricing service to other available market information our fair value committee fvc which includes representation from business area risk management and finance division provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment the fvc regularly review and approves our fair valuation to ensure that our valuation practice are consistent with industry standard and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance we have model policy established by an independent model risk office which governs the validation of model and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of model for pricing and fair value measurement the model risk office validates all model and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance the fair value governance process is set up in manner that allows the chairperson of the fvc to escalate valuation dispute that can not be resolved by the fvc to more senior committee called the valuation advisory committee vac for resolution the vac is chaired by the chief financial officer and includes other member of senior management the vac is only required to convene to review escalated valuation dispute financial asset and liabilitiesthe following describes the valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of our financial asset and liability recorded at fair value on recurring basis or nonrecurring basis and for financial instrument not recorded at fair value we apply the fair value provision to the financial instrument not recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet but required to be disclosed in this note the provision require to maximize the use of observable input and to measure fair value using notion of exit price were factored into our selection of input for our established valuation technique one financial corporation cof table

majority of security in other investment category we utilize multiple vendor pricing service to obtain fair value measurement waterfall of pricing vendor is determined in order of preference the determination of the top ranked pricing vendor is made on an annual basis part of an assessment of the performance of pricing service provided by the vendor pricing service may be considered the preferred or primary pricing provider depending on how closely aligned it price are to other vendor price and how consistent the price are with other available market information the price of each security is confirmed by comparing with other vendor price before it is finalized rmbs and cmb security are generally classified level or when significant assumption are not consistently observable fair value are derived using the best available data such data may include quote provided by dealer valuation from external pricing service independent pricing model or other model based valuation technique for example calculation of the present value of future cash flow incorporating assumption such benchmark yield spread prepayment speed credit rating and loss generally the pricing service utilize observable market data to the extent available pricing model may be used which can vary by asset class and may also incorporate available trade bid and other market information across asset class information such trader dealer input credit spread forward curve and prepayment speed are used to help determine appropriate valuation because many fixed income security do not trade on daily basis the pricing model may apply available information through process such benchmarking curve grouping security based on their characteristic and using matrix pricing to prepare valuation in addition model process are used by the pricing service to develop prepayment assumption we validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing provider through comparison of pricing to additional source including other pricing service dealer pricing indication in transaction result and other internal source pricing variance among different pricing source are analyzed additionally on an on going basis we request more detailed information from the valuation vendor to understand the pricing methodology and assumption used to value the security derivative asset and liabilitieswe use both exchange traded and otc derivative to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk exposure when quoted market price are available and used to value our exchange traded derivative we classify them level however predominantly all of our derivative do not have readily available quoted market price therefore we value most of our derivative using vendor based valuation technique we primarily rely on market observable input for our model such interest rate yield curve credit curve option volatility and currency rate these input can vary depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate price or index upon which the derivative value is based we typically classify derivative level when significant input can be observed in liquid market and the model itself doe not require significant judgment when instrument are traded in le liquid market and significant input are unobservable such interest rate swap whose remaining term do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curve such derivative are classified level the impact of counterparty non performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative asset official internal pricing

movement were due to combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payment and foreign exchange movement our best estimate of reasonably possible future loss beyond our reserve of december is approximately million litigationin accordance with the current accounting standard for loss contingency we establish reserve for litigation related matter that arise from the ordinary course of our business activity when it is probable that loss associated with claim or proceeding ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated none of the amount we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition litigation claim and proceeding of all type are subject to many uncertain factor that generally can not be predicted with assurance below we provide description of potentially material legal proceeding and claim for some of the matter disclosed below we are able to estimate reasonably possible loss above existing reserve and for other disclosed matter such an estimate is not possible at this time for those matter below where an estimate is possible management currently estimate the reasonably possible future loss beyond our reserve of december is approximately million which includes estimate related to mortgage representation and warranty exposure our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimate involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factor that may impact the ultimate loss level notwithstanding our attempt to estimate reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual level for some litigation matter based on current information it is possible that actual future loss will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible loss disclosed given the inherent uncertainty involved in these matter especially those involving governmental agency and the very large or indeterminate damage sought in some of these matter there is significant uncertainty to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matter and an adverse outcome in one or more of
