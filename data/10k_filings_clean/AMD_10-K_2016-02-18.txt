officer controller or person performing similar function we intend to disclose the nature of such amendment or waiver on our web site the information contained on our web site is not incorporated by reference in or considered to be part of this report our industry we are global semiconductor company semiconductor are component used in variety of electronic product and system an integrated circuit ic is semiconductor device that consists of many interconnected transistor on single chip since the invention of the transistor in improvement in ic process and design technology have led to the development of smaller complex and more reliable ic at lower cost per function computing and graphicsthe microprocessor and chipset market central processing unit cpu microprocessor is an ic that serf the cpu of computer it generally consists of hundred of million or billion of transistor that process data and control other device in the system acting the brain of the computer the performance of microprocessor is critical factor impacting the performance of computing and entertainment platform such desktop pc notebook tablet and workstation the principal element used to measure cpu performance are work per cycle or many instruction are executed per cycle clock speed representing the rate at which cpu internal logic operates measured in unit of gigahertz or billion of cycle per second and power consumption other factor impacting microprocessor performance include the number and type of core in microprocessor the bit rating of the microprocessor memory size and data access speed development in ic design and manufacturing process technology have resulted in significant advance in microprocessor performance business and consumer require greater performance from their computer system due to the growth of digital data and increasingly sophisticated software application semiconductor company are designing and developing multi core microprocessor multiple processor core are placed on single die or in single processor multi core microprocessor offer enhanced overall system performance and efficiency computing task can be spread across two or more processing core each of which can execute task at full speed multi core microprocessor can increase performance of computer system without greatly increasing the total amount of power consumed and the total amount of heat emitted business and consumer also require computer system with improved power management technology which help to reduce the power consumption of their computer system enable smaller and more portable form factor and lower total cost of ownership accelerated processing unit apu and system on chip soc consumer increasingly demand computing device with improved end user experience system performance and energy efficiency consumer also continue to demand thinner and lighter mobile device with better performance and longer battery life we believe that computing architecture that optimizes the use of it component can provide these improvement an apu is processing unit that integrates cpu and gpu onto one chip or one piece of silicon along with in some case other special purpose component this integration enhances system performance by offloading selected task the best suited component the cpu or the gpu to optimize component use increasing the speed of data flow between the cpu and gpu through shared memory and allowing the gpu to function both graphic engine and an application accelerator the cpu and gpu on the chip also typically improves energy efficiency by for example eliminating connection between discrete chip soc is type of ic with cpu gpu and other component such memory controller and peripheral management comprising complete computing system on single chip by combining all of these element soc system performance and energy efficiency is improved similar to an apu heterogeneous system architecture hsa describes an industry standard that is an overarching design for having combination of cpu and gpu processor core operate unified integrated engine that share system responsibility and resource we are founding member of the hsa foundation non profit organization established to define and promote this open standard based approach to heterogeneous computing heterogeneous computing allows for the elevation of the gpu to the same level of the cpu for memory access queuing and execution true compute core this capability allows software programmer to develop application to more fully utilize the capability of the graphic compute core graphic processing unit gpu gpu is programmable logic chip that render image animation and video and is also increasingly being used to handle general computing task gpus are located in plug in card discrete processor or in chipset on the motherboard or in the same chip the cpu gpus perform parallel operation on data to render image for the screen and are essential to presenting computer generated image on the screen decoding and rendering animation and video the more sophisticated the gpu the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother the motion gpus on stand alone card or discrete gpus on the motherboard typically include their memory while gpus in the chipset or cpu chip share main memory with the cpu in addition to graphic processing the parallel operation of gpus are used on multiple set of data increasingly used in vector processor for non graphic application that require repetitive computation such supercomputing deep neural network and various embedded application chipset chipset is generic term referring to collection of system level component that manage data flow among microprocessor or microprocessor memory and peripheral such cd rom drive dvd drive and usb peripheral chipsets perform essential logic function balance system performance and provide system control and power management function some chipsets have graphic capability by including an integrated graphic processor igp within the chipset chipset with an igp is known an igp chipset igp chipsets can offer lower cost reduced power alternative to discrete gpu and are often also used in smaller form factor system that are powered by an apu or by cpu and discrete gpu combination often do not have chipset and instead use an amd controller hub chip to perform the function of chipset result we believe that either an apu and amd controller hub chip combination or soc which already includes chipset will eventually replace the market for igp chipsets our microprocessor and chipset product our microprocessor are incorporated into computing platform which are collection of technology that are designed to work together to provide more complete computing solution and to enable and advance the computing component we believe that integrated balanced computing platform consisting of microprocessor chipsets and gpus either discrete gpus or integrated into an apu or soc that work together at the system level bring end user improved system stability increased performance and enhanced power efficiency in addition we believe our customer also benefit from an all amd platform consisting of an apu or cpu discrete gpu and chipset or an amd fusion controller hub chip we are able to optimize interoperability provide our customer single point of contact for the key platform component and enable them to bring the platform to market faster in variety of client and server system form factor we currently base our microprocessor and chipsets on the instruction set architecture and amd direct connect architecture which connects an on chip memory controller and input output channel directly to one or more microprocessor core we typically integrate two or more processor core onto single die and each core ha it own dedicated cache which is memory that is located on the semiconductor die permitting quick access to frequently used data and instruction some of

maintain it market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product for example intel ha introduced microprocessor for low cost notebook similar to product that we offer for low cost notebook intel could also take action that place our discrete gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on other competitor include variety of company providing or developing arm based design at relatively low cost and low power processor for the computing market including tablet and thin client form factor well dense server set top box and gaming console arm holding design and license it arm architecture to third party including and offer supporting software and service our ability to compete with company who use arm based solution depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy efficient high performing product at an attractive price point in the chipset market our competitor include supplier of igp chipsets pc manufacturer use igp chipsets because they typically cost le than traditional discrete gpus while offering acceptable graphic performance for most mainstream user intel also leverage it dominance in the microprocessor market to sell it igp chipsets intel manufacture and sell igp chipsets bundled with their microprocessor and is our main competitor in this market competition in the graphic market in the graphic market our competitor include supplier of discrete graphic embedded graphic processor and igp chipsets intel manufacture and sell embedded graphic processor and igp chipsets and is dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business higher unit shipment of our apus and intel integrated graphic may drive computer manufacturer to reduce the number of system they build paired with discrete graphic component particularly for notebook because they may offer satisfactory graphic performance for most mainstream pc user at lower cost intel could take action that place our discrete gpus and igp chipsets at competitive disadvantage such giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information our principal competitor in the graphic market is nvidia amd and nvidia are the two principal player offering discrete graphic solution other competitor include number of smaller company which may have greater flexibility to address specific market need but le financial resource to do so especially we believe that the growing complexity of graphic processor and the associated research and development cost represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market in the semi custom game console product where graphic performance is critical we compete primarily against nvidia and also compete against imagination technology group research and development we focus our research and development activity on improving product performance and enhancing product design our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of cpu and gpu ip and designing that ip into our socs for our next generation of product with in each case improved system performance and performance per watt characteristic for example we are focusing on improving the battery life of our microprocessor and apu product for notebook and the power efficiency of our microprocessor for server we are also focusing on delivering range of low power integrated platform to serve key market including commercial client mobile computing and gaming and medium computing we believe that these platform will bring customer increased performance and energy efficiency we also work with industry leader on process technology software and other functional intellectual property and we work with others in the industry and industry consortium to conduct early stage research and development our research and development expense for and approximately billion billion and billion respectively for more information see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation below we conduct product and system research and development activity for our product in the united state with additional design and development engineering team located in china canada india singapore taiwan and israel manufacturing arrangement and assembly and test facility third party wafer foundry facility globalfoundries inc on march we entered into wafer supply agreement wsa with globalfoundries inc gf the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf related party to pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf with limited exception for more information about the wsa see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation globalfoundries below taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company we also have foundry arrangement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc for the production of wafer for certain product other third party manufacturer we outsource board level graphic product manufacturing to third party manufacturer test mark and packaging facility we own and operate two assembly test mark and packaging facility which are subject of the transaction noted below some wafer for our product are delivered from third party foundry to our assembly test mark and packaging facility our assembly test mark and packaging facility are described in the chart set forth below facility locationapproximate manufacturing area square footageactivitypenang test mark packagingsuzhou test mark packaging the remaining wafer for our product are delivered from third party foundry to our test assembly and packaging partner located in the asia pacific region who package and test our final semiconductor product on october we entered into an equity interest purchase agreement the equity interest purchase agreement with nantong fujitsu microelectronics co ltd chinese joint stock company jv party under which we will sell to jv party majority of the equity interest in amd technology china co ltd wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated limited liability company the chinese target company and advanced micro device export sdn bhd malaysian limited liability company the malaysian target company and together with the chinese target company the target company thereby forming two joint venture collectively the jv with jv party in transaction valued at approximately million the transaction the jv party will acquire of the equity interest in each jv for approximately million and we estimate we will receive approximately million cash net of tax and other customary expense after closing jv party affiliate will own of the equity interest in each jv while certain of our subsidiary will own the remaining the transaction will result in the jv providing assembly testing marking packing and packaging service atmp to we plan to account for our investment in the jv under the equity method of accounting the transaction is expected to close in the first half of pending successful completion of regulatory and other approval intellectual property and licensing we rely on contract and intellectual property right to protect our product and technology from unauthorized third party copying and use intellectual property right include copyright patent patent application trademark trade secret and maskwork right of december we approximately patent in the united state and approximately patent application pending in the united state in certain case we have filed corresponding application in foreign jurisdiction including united state and foreign matter we have approximately patent matter worldwide consisting of approximately issued patent and patent application pending we expect to file future patent application in both the united state and abroad on significant invention we deem appropriate we do not believe that any individual patent or the expiration of any patent is or would be material to our business is typical in the semiconductor industry we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreement with other company under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property right one such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with intel on november under the cross license agreement we granted to intel and intel granted to non exclusive royalty free license to all of each other patent that were first filed no later than november and each party can exploit these patent anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor and electronic related product under the cross license agreement intel ha right to make semiconductor product for third party but the third party product design are not licensed result of such manufacture we have right to perform assembly and testing for third party but not right to make semiconductor product for third party the term of the cross license agreement continues the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patent unless earlier terminated party can terminate the cross license agreement or the right and license of the other party if the other party materially breach the cross license agreement and doe not correct the noticed material breach within day upon such termination the terminated party license right terminate but the terminating party license right continue subject to that party continued compliance with the term of the cross license agreement the cross license agreement will automatically terminate if party undergoes change of control defined in the cross license agreement and both party license will terminate upon the bankruptcy of party that party may assume but may not assign the cross license agreement and in the event that the cross license agreement can not be assumed the cross license agreement and the license granted will terminate sale are made primarily pursuant to purchase order for current delivery or agreement covering purchase over period of time some of these order or agreement may be revised or canceled without penalty generally in light of current industry practice we do not believe that such order or agreement provide meaningful backlog figure or are necessarily indicative of actual sale for any succeeding period seasonality our operating result tend to vary seasonally for example historically first quarter pc product sale are generally lower than fourth quarter sale in addition with respect to our semi custom soc product for game console we expect sale pattern to follow the seasonal trend of consumer business with sale in the first half of the year being lower than sale in the second half of the year employee of december we had approximately employee environmental regulation our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign environmental law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require to obtain permit for our operation including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to maintain compliance we can not assure you that we have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if we violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the security and exchange commission sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product item risk factor the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face if any of the following risk actually occurs our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially adversely affected in addition you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effect of two or more risk occurring simultaneously intel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive business practice may limit our ability to compete effectively intel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past and are likely in the future to result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for many of our product and adversely affect our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program result of intel position in the microprocessor market intel ha been able to control microprocessor and computer system standard and benchmark and to dictate the type of product the microprocessor market requires of intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphic chip motherboards and other component necessary to assemble computer system oems that purchase microprocessor for computer system are highly dependent on intel le innovative on their own and to large extent are distributor of intel technology additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard and specification for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action designed to limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer and channel partner de facto control over industry standard and heavy influence on pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system or bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it original equipment manufacturer oem customer intel ha substantially greater financial resource than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amount on marketing and research and development than we do we expect intel to maintain it market position and to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market before we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product for example intel ha introduced microprocessor for low cost notebook similar to product that we offer for low cost notebook intel could also take action that place our discrete gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on rely on gf to manufacture all of our microprocessor and apu product and certain portion of our gpu product with limited exception if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirement our business could be adversely impacted the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf with limited exception if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yield remain competitive using or implementing advanced leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product manufacture our product on timely basis at competitive price or meet our capacity requirement we may experience delay in product launch supply shortage for certain product or increased cost and our business could be materially adversely affected additionally if our requirement are le than the number of wafer that we committed to purchase we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit cost both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our result of operation we are currently in the process of negotiating sixth amendment to the wsa and we expect that our future purchase from gf will continue to be material if we do not successfully conclude our negotiation it could have material adverse impact on our gross margin and our result of operation in addition gf ha relied on mubadala technology investment llc mubadala tech for it funding need if mubadala tech fails to adequately fund gf on timely basis or at all gf ability to manufacture product for could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party to manufacture our product and if they are unable to do so on timely basis in sufficient quantity and using competitive technology our business could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party wafer foundry to fabricate the silicon wafer for all of our product we also rely on third party manufacturer to assemble test mark and pack certain of our product it is important to have reliable relationship with all of these third party manufacturing supplier to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand we can not guarantee that these manufacturer or our other third party manufacturing supplier will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirement if we experience supply constraint from our third party manufacturing supplier we may be required to allocate the affected product amongst our customer which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with these customer and on our financial condition in addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing supplier it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business we do not have long term commitment contract with some of our third party manufacturing supplier we obtain some of these manufacturing service on purchase order basis and these manufacturer are not required to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantity in an existing purchase order accordingly we depend on these supplier to allocate to portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis and at acceptable price the manufacturer we use also fabricate wafer and assemble test and package product for other company including certain of our competitor they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer increase the price that they charge on short notice or reduce or eliminate delivery to which could have material adverse effect on our business other risk associated with our dependence on third party manufacturer include limited control over delivery schedule and quality assurance lack of capacity in period of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractor and limited ability to manage inventory and part moreover if any of our third party manufacturer suffer any damage to facility lose benefit under material agreement experience power outage lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our product encounter financial difficulty are unable to secure necessary raw material from their supplier or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency we may encounter supply delay or disruption if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of product our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business if we transition the production of some of our product to new manufacturer we may experience delayed product introduction lower yield or poorer performance of our product if we experience problem with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from particular third party manufacturer or if we for other reason cease utilizing one of those supplier we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in short time frame we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturer which could have material adverse effect on our business to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result semiconductor manufacturing yield are result of both product design and process technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yield can result from design failure process technology failure or combination of both our third party foundry including gf are responsible for the process technology used to fabricate silicon wafer if our third party foundry experience manufacturing inefficiency or encounter disruption error or difficulty during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or experience product delivery delay we can not be certain that our third party foundry will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product profitably or on timely basis or that our competitor will not develop new technology product or process earlier moreover during period when foundry are implementing new process technology their manufacturing facility may not be fully productive substantial delay in the technology transition to smaller process technology could have material adverse effect on particularly if our competitor transition to more cost effective technology before any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in per unit cost which would adversely impact our gross margin and or force to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customer which could harm our relationship and reputation with our customer and materially adversely affect our business the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce product on timely basis with feature and performance level that provide value to our customer while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transition our success depends to significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of new product design and improvement that provide value to our customer our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new product and related technology to meet evolving industry requirement at price acceptable to our customer and on timely basis are significant factor in determining our competitiveness in our target market for example large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook segment which have experienced and continue to experience decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle consumer adopt new form factor have new product feature preference or have different requirement than those consumer in the pc market pc sale could be negatively impacted which could adversely impact our business our product roadmap includes new processor core codenamed zen to help drive our entry into high performance and server computing we can not assure you that our effort to execute our product roadmap and address market beyond our core pc market will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer if we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new product or technology that provide value to our customer and address these new trend or if we fail to predict which new form factor consumer will adopt and adjust our business accordingly we may lose competitive positioning which could cause to lose market share and require to discount the selling price of our product although we make substantial investment in research and development we can not be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new product and technology on timely basis delay in developing qualifying or shipping new product can also cause to miss our customer product design window or in some case breach contractual obligation or cause to pay penalty if our customer do not include our product in the initial design of their computer system or product they will typically not use our product in their system or product until at least the next design configuration the process of being qualified for inclusion in customer system or product can be lengthy and could cause to miss cycle in the demand of end user which also could result in loss of market share and harm our business in addition market demand requires that product incorporate new feature and performance standard on an industry wide basis over the life of specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time the introduction of new product and enhancement to existing product is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price if we are unable to introduce new product with sufficiently high sale price or to increase unit sale volume capable of offsetting the reduction in the sale price of existing product over time our business could be materially adversely affected if we can not generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing we may face cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investment in research and development or other strategic investment our ability to fund research and development expenditure depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operation and the availability of external financing if necessary our research and development expenditure together with ongoing operating expense will be substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balance if new competitor technological advance by existing competitor or other competitive factor require to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in our research and development effort our operating expense would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in research and development effort without an increase in revenue our operating result could decline regularly ass market for external financing opportunity including debt and equity financing additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or if available may not be available on satisfactory term the health of the credit market may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed any downgrade from credit rating agency such moody or standard poor may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the term of such financing in july moody lowered our corporate credit rating to from and our senior unsecured debt rating to from furthermore in october standard poor lowered our corporate credit rating to ccc from and our senior unsecured debt rating to ccc from credit agency downgrade or concern regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationship with our supplier who may limit our credit line our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operation may require to abandon project or curtail planned investment in research and development or other strategic initiative if we curtail planned investment in research and development or abandon project our product may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected the loss of significant customer may have material adverse effect on collectively our top five customer accounted for approximately of our net revenue during the year ended on segment basis in five customer accounted for approximately of the net revenue of our computing and graphic segment and five customer accounted for approximately of the net revenue of our enterprise embedded and semi custom segment we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of revenue of our business in the future if one of our key customer decides to stop buying our product or if one of these customer materially reduces or reorganizes it operation or it demand for our product our business would be materially adversely affected global economic uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating result uncertain global economic condition have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business including without limitation slowdown in the chinese economy one of the largest global market for desktop and notebook pc uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone purchase in addition during challenging economic time our current or potential future customer may experience cash flow problem and result may modify delay or cancel plan to purchase our product additionally if our customer are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of account receivable that they owe the risk related to our customer potentially defaulting on or delaying payment to is increased because we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of our revenue any inability of our current or potential future customer to pay for our product may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow moreover our key supplier may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our product in addition uncertain economic condition may make it more difficult for to raise fund through borrowing or private or public sale of debt or equity security we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligation or meet our working capital requirement our ability to make payment on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic condition and financial business and other factor many of which are beyond our control we can not assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow fund including under our secured revolving line of credit for principal amount to million our secured revolving line of credit in amount sufficient to enable to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirement if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operation or to borrow sufficient fund to service our debt we may be required to sell asset or equity reduce expenditure refinance all or portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing we can not assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt sell asset or equity borrow fund under our secured revolving line of credit or borrow more fund on term acceptable to if at all we have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation our total debt of december wa billion our substantial indebtedness may make it difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation including making scheduled principal and interest payment limit our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate and other purpose limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditure acquisition or other general corporate purpose require to use substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to make debt service payment place at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitor with relatively le debt and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry condition we enter into interest rate swap agreement from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk these swap agreement involve risk such the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligation under these arrangement the risk that these arrangement may not be effective in reducing our exposure to change in interest rate and the risk that our exposure to interest rate may increase if interest rate increase the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving line of credit impose restriction on that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business the indenture governing our senior note due note senior note due note senior note due note and senior note due note contain various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing incur additional indebtedness pay dividend and make other restricted payment make certain investment including investment in our unrestricted subsidiary create or permit certain lien create or permit restriction on the ability of certain restricted subsidiary to pay dividend or make other distribution to use the proceeds from sale of asset enter into certain type of transaction with affiliate and consolidate or merge or sell our asset an entirety or substantially an entirety our secured revolving line of credit also contains various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing make certain investment merge or consolidate with other entity and permit certain subsidiary from incurring indebtedness in addition further restriction apply when certain payment condition the payment condition are not satisfied with respect to specified transaction event or payment the payment condition include that no default or event of default exists and ii at all time during the consecutive day immediately prior to such transaction event or payment and on pro forma basis after giving effect to such transaction event or payment and any incurrence or repayment of indebtedness in connection therewith the loan party excess cash availability defined in the first amended and restated loan agreement available cash is greater than the greater of of the total commitment amount and million if payment condition are not satisfied under certain circumstance we will become subject to various additional covenant which limit our ability to among other thing create any lien upon any of the loan party property other than customary permitted lien and lien on up to billion of secured credit facility debt which amount includes our secured revolving line of credit declare or make cash distribution create any encumbrance on the ability of subsidiary to make any upstream payment make asset disposition other than certain ordinary course disposition and certain supply chain finance arrangement make certain loan make payment with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to it due date and become party to certain agreement restricting the loan party ability to enter into any non arm length transaction with an affiliate the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving line of credit contain cross default provision whereby default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreement covering other borrowing for example the occurrence of default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of million would cause cross default under the indenture governing our note note note and note well under our secured revolving line of credit the occurrence of default under any of these borrowing arrangement would permit the applicable note holder or the lender under our secured revolving line of credit to declare all amount outstanding under those borrowing arrangement to be immediately due and payable if the note holder or the trustee under the indenture governing our note note note note or the lender under our secured revolving line of credit accelerate the repayment of borrowing we can not assure you that we will have sufficient asset to repay those borrowing completion and impact of the restructuring plan our transformation initiative and any future restructuring action could adversely affect in the third quarter of we implemented restructuring plan restructuring plan focused on our ongoing effort to simplify our business and better align resource around our priority and business outlook the restructuring plan provides for workforce reduction of approximately and includes organizational action such outsourcing certain it service and application development the restructuring plan also anticipates charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facility we expect the restructuring plan to be largely completed by the end of the third quarter of these restructuring action and any future restructuring action could have an adverse impact on our business result of decrease in employee morale and the failure to meet operational target due to the loss of employee we can not be sure that we will realize operational saving or any other anticipated benefit from the restructuring plan or any future restructuring action any operating saving are subject to assumption estimate and significant economic competitive and other uncertainty some of which are beyond our control if these estimate and assumption are incorrect if we experience delay or if other unforeseen event occur our business and financial result could be adversely affected any transformation initiative or future restructuring action we undertake may fail to achieve the anticipated result and may materially adversely affect our business and financial result the market in which our product are sold are highly competitive the market in which our product are sold are competitive and delivering the latest and best product to market on timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth we believe that the main factor that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introduction product quality including enabling state of the art visual experience power consumption including battery life reliability processor clock speed performance size or form factor selling price cost adherence to industry standard and the creation of open industry standard level of integration software and hardware compatibility and stability brand recognition and availability we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological change frequent product introduction by our competitor or new competitor of product that may provide better performance experience or may include additional feature that render our product uncompetitive we may also face aggressive pricing by competitor especially during challenging economic time some competitor may have greater access or right to companion technology including interface processor and memory technical information with the introduction of our apu product and other competing solution with integrated graphic we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic chip and card may decrease in the future due to improvement in the quality and performance of integrated graphic in addition our competitor have significant marketing and sale resource which could increase the competitive environment in such declining market leading to lower price and margin if competitor introduce competitive new product into the market before demand for our product could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected in addition we are entering market with current and new competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market or superior ability to anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend we may face delay or disruption in research and development effort or we may be required to significantly invest greater resource in research and development than anticipated uncertainty involving the ordering and shipment of our product could materially adversely affect we typically sell our product pursuant to individual purchase order we generally do not have long term supply arrangement with our customer or minimum purchase requirement except that order generally must be for standard pack quantity generally our customer may cancel order for standard product more than day prior to shipment without incurring significant fee we base our inventory level in part on customer estimate of demand for their product which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our product that our customer will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our product are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributor and customer our forecast for demand are then based on estimate provided by multiple party throughout the downstream channel pc and consumer market are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion in addition our customer may change their inventory practice on short notice for any reason we may build inventory during period of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product order or overproduction due to failure of anticipated order to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margin that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of the value of our inventory reduction in the average selling price or reduction in our gross margin include sudden or significant decrease in demand for our product production or design defect in our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our product including for our older product our new product are introduced or our competitor taking aggressive pricing action for example in the third quarter of we recorded an inventory write of million consisting primarily of older generation apus which adversely impacted our operating result since market condition are uncertain these and other factor could materially adversely affect our business our receipt of revenue from our semi custom soc product is dependent upon our technology being designed into third party product and the success of those product the revenue that we receive from our semi custom soc product is in the form of non recurring engineering fee charged to third party for design and development service and revenue received in connection with sale of our semi custom soc product to these third party result our ability to generate revenue from our semi custom product depends on our ability to secure customer for our semi custom design pipeline our customer desire to pursue the project and our semi custom soc product being incorporated into those customer product any revenue from sale of our semi custom soc product is directly related to sale of the third party product and reflective of their success in the market moreover we have no control over the marketing effort of these third party and we can not make any assurance that sale of their product will be successful in current or future year consequently the semi custom soc product revenue expected by may not be fully realized and our operating result may be adversely affected the demand for our product depends in part on the market condition in the industry into which they are sold fluctuation in demand for our product or market decline in any of these industry could have material adverse effect on our result of operation industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on the consumer desktop pc and notebook segment which have experienced and continue to experience decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle the success of our semi custom soc product is dependent on securing customer for our semi custom design pipeline and consumer market condition including the success of the sony playstation and microsoft xbox one game console system worldwide our ability to design and introduce new product in timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property in the design and development of new product and product enhancement we rely on third party intellectual property such software development tool and hardware testing tool furthermore certain product feature may rely on intellectual property acquired from third party the design requirement necessary to meet consumer demand for more feature and greater functionality from semiconductor product may exceed the capability of the third party intellectual property or development tool available to if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available in the time frame or price point needed for our new product or fails to produce design that meet customer demand our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software and other computer platform component to support our business we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software bios operating system and other component that our customer utilize to support our microprocessor gpu and apu offering we also rely on aibs to support our gpu and apu product in addition our microprocessor are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessor if the designer manufacturer aibs and supplier of motherboards software and other component decrease their support for our product offering our business could be materially adversely affected we lose microsoft corporation support for our product or other software vendor do not design and develop software to run on our product our ability to sell our product could be materially adversely affected our ability to innovate beyond the instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing it operating system to run on or support our based microprocessor product with respect to our graphic product we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop it operating system to run on or support our graphic product similarly the success of our product in the market such our apu product is dependent on independent software provider designing and developing software to run on our product if microsoft doe not continue to design and develop it operating system so that they work with our instruction set or doe not continue to develop and maintain their operating system to support our graphic product independent software provider may forego designing their software application to take advantage of our innovation and customer may not purchase pc with our product in addition some software driver sold with our product are certified by microsoft if microsoft did not certify driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendor our ability to market our product would be materially adversely affected our reliance on third party distributor and aib partner subject to certain risk we market and sell our product directly and through third party distributor and aib partner pursuant to agreement that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party these agreement are non exclusive and permit both our distributor and aibs to offer our competitor product we are dependent on our distributor and aibs to supplement our direct marketing and sale effort if any significant distributor or aib or substantial number of our distributor or aibs terminated their relationship with decided to market our competitor product over our product or decided not to market our product at all our ability to bring our product to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage the risk related to the use of our third party distributor and aib partner or offer appropriate incentive to focus them on the sale of our product our business could be materially adversely affected additionally distributor and aibs typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product against price reduction well provide return right for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than month older than the manufacturing code date some agreement with our distributor also contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return our agreement with aibs protect their inventory of our product against price reduction we defer the gross margin on our sale to distributor and aibs resulting from both our deferral of revenue and related product cost until the applicable product are re sold by the distributor or the aibs however in the event of significant decline in the price of our product the price protection right we offer would materially adversely affect because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our product development program much of our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous qualified engineering marketing sale and executive personnel if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain qualified personnel necessary for our business the progress of our product development program could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we use share based incentive award such employee stock option and non vested share unit restricted stock unit if the value of such stock award doe not appreciate measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our share based compensation otherwise cease to be viewed valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate personnel could be weakened which could harm our result of operation in addition our current and any future restructuring plan may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employee in the event of change of control we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt required by the applicable indenture and our secured revolving line of credit which would result in default under the indenture and our secured revolving line of credit upon change of control we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our note note note and note then outstanding at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any up to but excluding the repurchase date in addition change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving line of credit of december million wa outstanding under our secured revolving line of credit and billion wa outstanding under our note future debt agreement may contain similar provision we may not have the financial resource to repurchase our outstanding note and prepay all of our outstanding obligation under our secured revolving line of credit semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced severe downturn that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced significant downturn often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuation in supply and demand continuous new product introduction price erosion and decline in general economic condition we have incurred substantial loss in recent downturn due to substantial decline in average selling price the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry decline in demand for end user product such pc that incorporate our product and excess inventory level industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future for example form factor device continue to shift from desktop pc and notebook to smaller form factor device large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on consumer desktop pc and notebook segment which have experienced and continue to experience decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle global economic uncertainty and weakness have also impacted the semiconductor market consumer and business have deferred purchase which negatively impacted demand for our product our financial performance ha been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturn the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our product from high growth adjacent emerging global market our ability to be successful in such market depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure well our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationship in these market if demand from these market is below our expectation sale of our product may decrease which would have material adverse effect on acquisition divestiture and or joint venture could disrupt our business harm our financial condition and operating result or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offering and grow our business in response to changing technology customer demand and competitive pressure in some circumstance we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary business solution or technology or through divestiture or joint venture rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidate can be difficult time consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition or joint venture moreover if such acquisition or joint venture require to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term favorable to or at all even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technology solution asset personnel or operation particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for acquisition and joint venture may also involve the entry into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefit of the acquisition or joint venture which could harm our operating result in addition to complete an acquisition we may issue equity security which would dilute our stockholder ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock well incur debt assume contingent liability or have amortization expense and write down of acquired asset which could adversely affect our result of operation acquisition and joint venture may also reduce our cash available for operation and other us which could harm our business we may not achieve the objective and expectation with respect to future operation product and service in october we entered into an equity interest purchase agreement the equity interest purchase agreement with nantong fujitsu microelectronics co ltd chinese joint stock company jv party under which we will sell to jv party majority of the equity interest in amd technology china co ltd wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated limited liability company the chinese target company and advanced micro device export sdn bhd malaysian limited liability company the malaysian target company and together with the chinese target company the target company thereby forming two joint venture collectively the jv with jv party in transaction valued at approximately million the transaction the jv party will acquire of the equity interest in each jv for approximately million and we estimate we will receive approximately million cash net of tax and other customary expense after closing jv party affiliate will own of the equity interest in each jv while certain of our subsidiary will own the remaining the transaction will result in the jv providing assembly testing marking packing and packaging service atmp to the transaction is expected to close in the first half of and is expected to simplify our business model while strengthening our balance sheet the transaction requires numerous international regulatory approval in order to close it is possible that we may not receive the approval necessary to close the transaction in timely manner or the approval may result in additional unanticipated cost long duration between entering into definitive agreement and the proposed closing in the first half of could result in loss of employee morale and result in loss of key employee affecting the success of the jv while we expect the transaction to be cost neutral with reduced capital expenditure the transaction could potentially increase our cost for atmp service with little to no measurable reduction in our capital expenditure additionally we may not realize the expected benefit from the transaction including the jv expected future performance and financial projection and the jv expected future result of operation and financial condition the majority of atmp service will be provided by the jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to adequately fulfill our atmp requirement we transition operation to the jv party is there any guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon number of internal business process and information system to support key business function and the efficient operation of these process and system is critical to our business our business process and information system need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modification or upgrade that expose to number of operational risk such our information system will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business need these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time these change may also require change in our information system modification of internal control procedure and significant training of employee and third party resource we continuously work on simplifying our information system and application through consolidation and standardization effort there can be no assurance that our business and operation will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition our information technology system and those of third party information technology provider or business partner may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstance beyond our control including catastrophic event power anomaly or outage natural disaster virus or malware cyber attack data breach and computer system or network failure exposing to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business in addition our it environment continues to evolve we are embracing new way of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customer and partner using method such mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency however these practice can also result in more distributed it environment making it more difficult for to maintain visibility and control over internal and external user and meet scalability and administrative requirement if our security control can not keep pace with the speed of these change or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirement our business would be materially adversely affected data breach and cyber attack could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information be costly to remediate and cause significant damage to our business and reputation in the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our network including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customer and business partner the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation we believe that company have been increasingly subject to wide variety of security incident cyber attack hacking and phishing attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access these threat can come from variety of source all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker to state sponsored attack cyber threat may be generic or they may be custom crafted against our information system over the past year cyber attack have become more prevalent and much harder to detect and defend against our network and storage application may be subject to unauthorized access by hacker or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruption it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incident and the damage caused by such incident these data breach and any unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyber attack could also cause to incur significant remediation cost result in product development delay disrupt key business operation and divert attention of management and key information technology resource these incident could also subject to liability expose to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business in addition we could be subject to potential claim for damage resulting from loss of data from alleged vulnerability in the security of our processor we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our worker the integrity and protection of our worker data is critical to our business and our worker have high expectation that we will adequately protect their personal information we anticipate an increase in cost related to implementing new data security procedure including cost related to upgrading computer and network security training worker to maintain and monitor our security measure remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation and mitigating reputational harm often partner with third party provider for certain worker service and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third party based on the scope of the service provided to however if these third party fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our worker data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed breach of data privacy is likely to cause significant disruption of our business operation failure to adequately maintain and update our security system could materially adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain worker confidence failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information and data breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition our competitive position and operating result our operating result are subject to quarterly and seasonal sale pattern substantial portion of our quarterly sale have historically been made in the last month of the quarter this uneven sale pattern make prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increase the risk of unanticipated variation in quarterly result and financial condition in addition our operating result tend to vary seasonally for example historically first quarter pc product sale are generally lower than fourth quarter sale in addition with respect to our semi custom soc product for game console we expect sale pattern to follow the seasonal trend of consumer business with sale in the first half of the year being lower than sale in the second half of the year many of the factor that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trend are beyond our control if essential equipment material or manufacturing process are not available to manufacture our product we could be materially adversely affected we purchase equipment and material for our internal back end manufacturing operation from number of supplier and our operation depend upon obtaining delivery of adequate supply of equipment and material on timely basis our third party supplier also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantity of equipment and material in the manufacture of our product in addition many of our product increase in technical complexity we rely on our third party supplier to update their process in order to continue meeting our back end manufacturing need certain equipment and material that are used in the manufacture of our product are available only from limited number of supplier or in some case sole supplier we also depend on limited number of supplier to provide the majority of certain type of integrated circuit package for our microprocessor including our apu product similarly certain non proprietary material or component such memory printed circuit board pcbs interposers substrate and capacitor used in the manufacture of our product are currently available from only limited number of source because some of the equipment and material that we and our third party manufacturing supplier purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor also some of these material and component may be subject to rapid change in price and availability interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortage and price increase in various essential material dependence on sole supplier or limited number of supplier exacerbates these risk if we are unable to procure certain of these material for our back end manufacturing operation or our third party foundry or manufacturing supplier are unable to procure material for manufacturing our product our business would be materially adversely affected if our product are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected our product may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problem in timely manner if our customer are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware we could be materially adversely affected in addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our product could have material adverse effect on our business cost related to defective product could have material adverse effect on product complex those we offer may contain defect or failure when first introduced or when new version or enhancement to existing product are released we can not assure you that despite our testing procedure error will not be found in new product or release after commencement of commercial shipment in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our product material recall and replacement cost delay in recognition or loss of revenue writing down the inventory of defective product the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development effort defending against litigation related to defective product or related property damage or personal injury and damage to our reputation in the industry and could adversely affect our relationship with our customer in addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customer of the defective product in the field result we could incur substantial cost to implement modification to correct defect any of these problem could materially adversely affect our business could be subject to potential product liability claim if one of our product cause or merely appears to have caused an injury claim may be made by consumer or others selling our product and we may be subject to claim against even if an alleged injury is due to the action of others product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liability or for amount in excess of insured liability could have material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain we respond to change in customer demand for our product our business could be materially adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand for our product depends in part on our ability to deliver the product our customer want on timely basis accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our product we continue to grow our business expand to high growth adjacent market acquire new customer and strengthen relationship with existing customer the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customer tend to have specific requirement for particular product and specific time frame in which they require delivery of these product if we are unable to consistently deliver the right product to our customer on timely basis in the right location our customer may reduce the quantity they order from which could have material adverse effect on our business we outsource to third party certain supply chain logistics function including portion of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support service we rely on third party provider to operate our regional product distribution center and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished product among our facility to our manufacturing supplier and to our customer in addition we rely on third party to provide certain information technology service to including help desk support desktop application service business and software support application server and storage administration data center operation database administration and voice video and remote access we can not guarantee that these provider will fulfill their respective responsibility in timely manner in accordance with the contract term in which case our internal operation and the distribution of our product to our customer could be materially adversely affected also we can not guarantee that our contract with these third party provider will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these function in house or secure new provider which could have material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately we may incur future impairment of goodwill we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any event or change in circumstance such significant adverse change in business climate or operating result change in management business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecast or significant decline in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these event may require to record future goodwill impairment charge our worldwide operation are subject to political legal and economic risk and natural disaster which could have material adverse effect on we maintain operation around the world including in the united state canada europe and asia we rely on third party wafer foundry in europe and asia nearly all product assembly and final testing of our product is performed at manufacturing facility operated by well third party manufacturing facility in china malaysia and taiwan we also have international sale operation international sale percent of net revenue were in we expect that international sale will continue to be significant portion of total sale in the foreseeable future the political legal and economic risk associated with our operation in foreign country include without limitation expropriation change in specific country or region political or economic condition change in tax law trade protection measure and import or export licensing requirement difficulty in protecting our intellectual property difficulty in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practice and labor law change in foreign currency exchange rate restriction on transfer of fund and other asset of our subsidiary between jurisdiction change in freight and interest rate disruption in air transportation between the united state and our overseas facility loss or modification of exemption for tax and tariff and compliance with law and regulation related to international operation including export control and economic sanction law and regulation and the foreign corrupt practice act in addition our worldwide operation or those of our business partner could be subject to natural disaster such earthquake tsunami flooding typhoon and volcanic eruption that disrupt manufacturing or other operation for example our sunnyvale operation are located near major earthquake fault line in california any conflict or uncertainty in the country in which we operate including public health issue for example an outbreak of contagious disease such avian influenza measles or ebola safety issue natural disaster fire disruption of service from utility nuclear power plant accident or general economic or political factor could have material adverse effect on our business any of the risk should they occur could result in an increase in the cost of component production delay general business interruption delay from difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology tariff and other barrier and restriction longer payment cycle increased tax restriction on the repatriation of fund and the burden of complying with variety of foreign law any of which could ultimately have material adverse effect on our business worldwide political condition may adversely affect demand for our product worldwide political condition may create uncertainty that could adversely affect our business the united state ha been and may continue to be involved in armed conflict that could have further impact on our sale and our supply chain the consequence of armed conflict political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee event that could have material adverse effect on terrorist attack or other hostile act may negatively affect our operation or adversely affect demand for our product and such attack or related armed conflict may impact our physical facility or those of our supplier or customer furthermore these attack or hostile act may make travel and the transportation of our product more difficult and more expensive which could materially adversely affect any of these event could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united state economy and worldwide financial market unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect we have cost asset and liability that are denominated in foreign currency consequence movement in exchange rate could cause our foreign currency denominated expense to increase percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flow whenever we believe appropriate we hedge portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuation in currency exchange rate we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projection of long term expenditure for item such payroll we can not assure you that these activity will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in addition the majority of our product sale are denominated in dollar fluctuation in the exchange rate between the dollar and the local currency can cause increase or decrease in the cost of our product in the local currency of such customer an appreciation of the dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sale of our product our inability to effectively control the sale of our product on the gray market could have material adverse effect on we market and sell our product directly to oems and through authorized third party distributor from time to time our product are diverted from our authorized distribution channel and are sold on the gray market gray market product result in shadow inventory that is not visible to thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately also when gray market product enter the market we and our distribution channel compete with these heavily discounted gray market product which adversely affect demand for our product and negatively impact our margin in addition our inability to control gray market activity could result in customer satisfaction issue because any time product are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel there is risk that our customer are buying counterfeit or substandard product including product that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used product represented new if we can not adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united state and abroad through patent copyright trade secret trademark and other measure we may lose competitive advantage and incur significant expense we rely on combination of protection provided by contract including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement copyright patent trademark and common law right such trade secret to protect our intellectual property however we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united state and abroad any patent licensed by or issued to could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or right granted there under may not provide competitive advantage to furthermore patent application that we file may not result in issuance of patent or if patent is issued the patent may not be issued in form that is advantageous to despite our effort to protect our intellectual property right others may develop similar product duplicate our product or design around our patent and other right in addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on worldwide basis in cost effective manner in jurisdiction where foreign law provide le intellectual property protection than afforded in the united state and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected we are party to litigation and may become party to other claim or litigation that could cause to incur substantial cost or pay substantial damage or prohibit from selling our product from time to time we are defendant or plaintiff in various legal action for example on january march april and september complaint were filed against seeking damage for alleged security law violation which are described in note of our consolidated financial statement our product are purchased by and or used by consumer which could increase our exposure to consumer action such product liability claim and consumer class action claim on occasion we receive claim that individual were allegedly exposed to substance used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility and that this alleged exposure caused harm litigation can involve complex factual and legal question and it outcome is uncertain any claim that is successfully asserted against including the claim filed against on january march april and september may result in the payment of damage that could be material to our business with respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third party may bring or have brought action against and or against our customer based on allegation that we are infringing the intellectual property right of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property right of others improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others if any such claim are asserted we may seek to obtain license under the third party intellectual property right we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary license on satisfactory term if at all these party may file lawsuit against or our customer seeking damage potentially up to and including treble damage or an injunction against the sale of product that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business presently conducted which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our product or to increase the cost of selling some of our product or which could damage our reputation the award of damage including material royalty payment or other type of damage or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our product could have material adverse effect on we could decide in the alternative to redesign our product or to resort to litigation to challenge such claim such challenge could be extremely expensive and time consuming regardless of their merit could cause delay in product release or shipment and or could have material adverse effect on we can not assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property right or the intellectual property right of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operation which could have material adverse effect on our business is subject to potential tax liability we are subject to income tax in the united state canada and other foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable we can not assure you that the final determination of any tax audit and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical income tax provision and accrual should additional tax be assessed result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be material adverse effect on our cash income tax provision and net income in the period or period for which that determination is made variety of environmental law that we are subject to could result in additional cost and liability our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign environmental law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require to obtain permit for our operation including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to maintain compliance we can not assure you that we have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if we violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising out of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the security and exchange commission sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product higher health care cost and labor cost could adversely affect our business with the passage in of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca we are required to provide affordable coverage defined in the aca to all employee or otherwise be subject to payment per employee based on the affordability criterion in the aca additionally some state and locality have passed state and local law mandating the provision of certain level of health benefit by some employer increased health care and insurance cost could have material adverse effect on our business in addition change in federal or state workplace regulation could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial target item unresolved staff commentsnone item propertiesat december we owned research and development engineering and manufacturing facility located in china and manufacturing and administrative facility located in malaysia these facility totaled approximately square foot and include approximately square foot of assembly test mark and packaging facility our current microprocessor assembly and test facility located in malaysia and china are described in further detail in the section entitled assembly test mark and packaging facility above in some case we lease the land on which our facility are located we lease approximately square foot of land in suzhou china for our microprocessor assembly and test facility of december we also leased approximately million square foot of space for research and development engineering administrative and warehouse use including our headquarters in sunnyvale california our principal administrative facility in austin texas our main facility with respect to graphic and chipset product located in markham ontario canada and number of smaller regional sale office located in commercial center near customer principally in the united state latin america europe and asia these lease expire at varying date through although some of these lease include optional renewal the lease for our headquarters in sunnyvale california expires in december and provides for two successive year optional renewal the lease for our principal administrative facility in austin texas expires in march and provides for one year optional renewal the lease for our facility in markham ontario canada expires in february and provides for one year optional renewal we currently do not anticipate difficulty in either retaining occupancy of any of our facility through lease renewal prior to expiration or through month to month occupancy

central processing unit cpu or incorporated into an accelerated processing unit apu chipsets and discrete graphic processing unit gpus for the consumer commercial and professional graphic market and ii server and embedded cpu gpus and apus and semi custom system on chip soc product and technology for game console in this md we will describe the result of operation and the financial condition for and our consolidated subsidiary including discussion of our result of operation for compared to and compared to an analysis of change in our financial condition and discussion of our contractual obligation and balance sheet arrangement overview we faced challenging business environment in the impact of global macro economic condition especially the volatility in the greater china region contributed to decrease in demand for our product additionally competitive pressure contributed to an overall challenging year we also experienced reduced demand from our original equipment manufacturer oem customer in advance of the launch of microsoft window net revenue for wa approximately billion decrease of compared to net revenue of billion the decrease in net revenue from wa due to decrease in computing and graphic segment revenue and an decrease in enterprise embedded and semi custom segment revenue computing and graphic segment revenue declined year over year primarily due to lower client processor sale enterprise embedded and semi custom segment revenue declined year over year primarily due to lower server and embedded revenue and lower game console royalty partially offset by higher semi custom soc sale gross margin percentage of net revenue for wa compared to in gross margin in wa adversely impacted by an inventory write down of million which wa primarily the result of lower anticipated demand for older generation apus and technology node transition charge of million the impact of the write down accounted for approximately two gross margin percentage point and the technology node transition charge accounted for approximately one gross margin percentage point gross margin in wa also adversely impacted by lower proportion of revenue from computing and graphic segment due to lower sale which ha higher average gross margin than our enterprise embedded and semi custom segment and due to lower game console royalty gross margin in included million lower of cost or market inventory adjustment which accounted for one gross margin percentage point and million benefit from technology licensing revenue which accounted for le than one gross margin percentage point operating loss for wa million compared to an operating loss of million in the decline in operating performance in compared to wa primarily due to decrease in net revenue and in gross margin described above despite the challenging business environment we made important change to our business during we continued to focus on introducing more diverse product portfolio part of our long

reality experience and smoother gameplay with respect our embedded product we introduced the amd embedded series soc processor designed for digital signage retail signage medical imaging electronic gaming medium storage and communication and networking during we continued to focus on reducing our expense our operating expense in decreased to billion from billion in our operating expense in included goodwill impairment charge of million we also took step to simplify our business and better align resource around our priority and business outlook in the third quarter of we implemented restructuring plan restructuring plan the restructuring plan provides for workforce reduction of approximately and includes organizational action such outsourcing certain it service and application development the restructuring plan also anticipates charge for the consolidation of certain real estate facility we realized operational saving primarily in operating expense of approximately million in we expect the restructuring plan to result in operational saving primarily in operating expense of approximately million in on october we entered into an equity interest purchase agreement the equity interest purchase agreement with nantong fujitsu microelectronics co ltd chinese joint stock company jv party under which we will sell to jv party majority of the equity interest in amd

agreement the funding agreement and shareholder agreement the shareholder agreement on march at gf formation on march and through december gf wa deemed variable interest entity and we were deemed to be gf primary beneficiary accordingly we consolidated gf under applicable accounting rule result of certain gf governance change we deconsolidated gf and accounted for our gf ownership under the equity method of accounting of december following the deconsolidation gf became our related party in the first quarter of result of contribution to gf by an affiliate of mubadala tech and certain gf governance change noted above our ownership in gf wa diluted and we concluded that we no longer had the ability to exercise significant influence over gf accordingly we changed our accounting for our investment in gf from the equity method to the cost method of accounting and recognized dilution gain in investee of approximately million in the fourth quarter of we identified indicator of impairment in gf that were deemed other than temporary we performed valuation analysis and recorded non cash impairment charge of million the carrying value of our remaining investment in gf after the impairment charge wa million of december on march partial consideration for certain right received under second amendment to the wsa we transferred to gf all of the remaining capital stock of gf that we owned in addition of march the funding agreement wa terminated and we were no longer party to the shareholder agreement result of these transaction we no longer owned any gf capital stock of march gf continues to be related party of because mubadala development company pjsc mubadala and mubadala tech are affiliated with wch our largest stockholder wch and mubadala tech are wholly owned subsidiary of mubadala supply agreement the wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf with limited exception if we acquire third party business that manufacture microprocessor and apu product we will have up to two year to transition the manufacture of such microprocessor and apu product to gf the wsa terminates no later than march gf ha agreed to use commercially reasonable effort to assist to transition the supply of product to another provider and to continue to fulfill purchase order for up to two year following the termination or expiration of the wsa during the transition period pricing for microprocessor and apu product will remain set forth in the wsa but our purchase commitment to gf will no longer apply third amendment to wafer supply agreement on december we entered into third amendment to the wsa pursuant to the third amendment we modified our wafer purchase commitment for the fourth quarter of made pursuant to the second amendment to the wsa in addition we agreed to certain pricing and other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for our microprocessor and apu product to be delivered by gf to from the fourth quarter of through december pursuant to the third amendment gf agreed to waive portion of our wafer purchase commitment for the fourth quarter of in consideration for this waiver we agreed to pay gf fee of million result we recorded lower of cost or market charge of million for the write down of inventory to it market value in the fourth quarter of the cash impact of this million fee wa paid over several quarter with million paid on december million paid on april and million paid on december fourth amendment to wafer supply agreement on march we entered into fourth amendment to the wsa the primary effect of the fourth amendment wa to establish volume purchase commitment and fixed pricing for the calendar year well to modify certain other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for some of our microprocessor graphic processor and semi custom game console product to be delivered by gf to during the calendar year fifth amendment to wafer supply agreement on april we entered into fifth amendment to the wsa the primary effect of the fifth amendment wa to establish volume purchase commitment and fixed pricing for the calendar year well to modify certain other term of the wsa applicable to wafer for some of our microprocessor unit graphic processor unit and semi custom product to be delivered by gf to during the calendar year of december certain wafer delivery under the fifth amendment to the wsa have been delayed until fiscal of december purchase obligation for fiscal were approximately million of which approximately million consisting of wafer and research and development activity were received by december we generally negotiate our purchase commitment with gf on an annual basis and such we can not meaningfully quantify or estimate our future purchase obligation to gf we are currently in the process of negotiating sixth amendment to the wsa and we expect that our future purchase from gf will continue to be material our total purchase from gf related to wafer manufacturing and research and development activity were approximately billion for and approximately billion for each and respectively equity interest purchase agreementon october we entered into an equity interest purchase agreement the equity interest purchase agreement with nantong fujitsu microelectronics co ltd chinese joint stock company jv party under which we will sell to jv party majority of the equity interest in amd technology china co ltd wholly foreign owned enterprise incorporated limited liability company the chinese target company and advanced micro device export sdn bhd malaysian limited liability company the malaysian target company and together with the chinese target company the target company thereby forming two joint venture collectively the jv with jv party in transaction valued at approximately million the transaction the jv party will acquire of the equity interest in each jv for approximately million and we estimate we will receive approximately million cash net of tax and other customary

agreement including with respect to the malaysian target company shareholder agreement and with respect to the chinese target company joint venture contract governing the joint venture relationship from and after the closing ii an ip license agreement iii manufacturing service agreement iv transition service agreement and trademark license agreement the transaction is expected to close in the first half of pending all regulatory and other approval result of the decision to form the above jv the balance sheet of december reflects held for sale accounting of the atmp asset and liability which requires reclassification of such financial amount to current asset and current liability we reclassified million to other current asset and million to other current liability asset balance reclassified into other current asset primarily consist of property plant and equipment of million goodwill of million and inventory of million liability balance reclassified into other current liability primarily consist of account payable of million the balance included in the final gain loss calculation at closing are likely to be different due to normal operational activity occurring through the closing date critical accounting estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap the preparation of our financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount in our consolidated financial statement we evaluate our estimate on an on going basis including those related to our revenue inventory goodwill impairment and income tax we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability although actual result have historically been reasonably consistent with management expectation the actual result may differ from these estimate or our estimate may be affected by different assumption or condition management belief the following critical accounting estimate are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statement and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgment revenue allowance we record provision for estimated sale return and allowance on product sale for estimated future price reduction and other customer incentive in the same period that the related revenue are recorded we base these estimate on actual historical sale return historical allowance historical price reduction market activity and other known or anticipated trend and factor these estimate are subject to management judgment and actual provision could be different from our estimate and current provision resulting in future adjustment to our revenue and operating result inventory valuation at each balance sheet date we evaluate our ending inventory for excess quantity and obsolescence based on projected sale outlook this evaluation includes analysis of historical sale level by product and projection of future demand these projection assist in determining the carrying value of our inventory in addition we write off inventory that we consider obsolete we adjust the remaining specific inventory balance to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value among other factor management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand competitiveness of product offering market condition and product life cycle when determining obsolescence and market value if in any period we anticipate future demand or market condition to be le favorable than our previous estimate additional inventory write down may be required and would be reflected in cost of sale in the period the revision is made this would have negative impact on our gross margin in that period if in any period we are able to sell inventory that were not valued or that had been written down in previous period related revenue would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sale resulting in net benefit to our gross margin in that period goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible asset acquired goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there are indicator of impairment present we perform an annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year we evaluate whether goodwill ha been impaired at the reporting unit level by first determining whether the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value and if so by determining whether the implied fair value of goodwill within the reporting unit is le than the carrying value the implied fair value of reporting unit is determined through the application of one or more valuation model common to our industry including the income market and cost approach while market valuation data for comparable company is gathered and analyzed we believe that there ha not been sufficient comparability between the peer group and the specific reporting unit to allow for the derivation of reliable indication of value using market approach therefore we have ultimately employed the income approach which requires estimate of present value of estimated future cash flow cash flow projection are based on management estimate of revenue growth rate and operating margin taking into consideration industry and market condition the key assumption we have used to determine the fair value of our reporting unit includes projected cash flow for the next year and discount rate ranging from to from to the discount rate used is based on the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business specific characteristic and the related to the reporting unit ability to execute on the projected cash flow variance in the discount rate could have significant impact on the amount of the goodwill impairment charge recorded if any estimating the fair value of reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimate and assumption these estimate and assumption include revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow risk adjusted discount rate future economic and market condition and the determination of appropriate comparable publicly traded company in addition we make certain judgment and assumption in allocating shared asset and liability to individual reporting unit to determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit based on the result of our annual analysis of goodwill in each reporting unit fair value exceeded it carrying value ranging from approximately to approximately the computing and graphic reporting unit had the lowest excess of fair value over carrying value at however there is no goodwill within this reporting unit in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trend that existed of september the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit based on the result of our annual goodwill impairment analysis in we determined that the carrying value of the computing and graphic reporting unit exceeded it estimated fair value and accordingly an impairment charge of million wa recorded which represented the entire goodwill balance within this reporting unit the remaining two reporting unit estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value ranging from approximately to approximately in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit we took into consideration the challenging industry and market trend that existed of september the date of the annual goodwill impairment test for each respective reporting unit based on the result of our annual analysis of goodwill in each reporting unit fair value exceeded it carrying value indicating that there wa no goodwill impairment estimate of fair value for all or our reporting unit can be affected by variety of external and internal factor potential event or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the key assumption we used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit include adverse change in our industry increased competition an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace or to achieve internal forecast and decline in our stock price if the estimated fair value of our reporting unit decline due to any of these factor we may be required to record future goodwill impairment income tax in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purpose we must make certain estimate and judgment these estimate and judgment are applied in the calculation of certain tax liability and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax asset which arise from temporary difference between the recognition of asset and liability for tax and financial statement reporting purpose we must ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our charge to income tax expense in the form of valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we consider past performance future expected taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategy in determining the need for valuation allowance in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax rule and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax position by the internal revenue service or other taxing authority if our estimate of these tax are greater or le than actual result an additional tax benefit or charge will result we recognize the interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit interest expense and income tax expense respectively result of operationsmanagement including the chief operating decision maker who is our chief executive officer review and ass our operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income loss before interest other income expense net and income tax these performance measure include the allocation of expense to the operating segment based on management judgment in connection with our continued strategic transformation effective july we realigned our organizational structure result of this organizational change we have the following two reportable segment the computing and graphic segment which primarily includes desktop and notebook processor and chipsets discrete gpus and professional graphic and the enterprise embedded and semi custom segment which primarily includes server and embedded processor semi custom soc product engineering service and royalty in addition to these reportable segment we have an all other category which is not reportable segment this category primarily includes certain expense and credit that are not allocated to any of the reportable segment because management doe consider these expense and credit in evaluating the performance of the reportable segment also included in this category are amortization of acquired intangible asset employee stock based compensation expense restructuring and other special charge net technology node transition charge workforce rebalancing severance charge goodwill impairment charge significant or unusual lower of cost or market inventory adjustment and net
