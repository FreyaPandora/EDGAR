electric utility and is the largest electric utility in the state of florida and one of the largest electric utility in the based on retail mwh sale fpl with mw of generating capacity at december supply electric service throughout of the east and lower west coast of florida serving more than million people through approximately million customer account at december fpl service territory and plant location are follows see item property generation facility of contentsfranchise agreement and competitionfpl service to it retail customer is provided primarily under franchise agreement negotiated with municipality or county alternatively municipality and county may form their own utility company to provide service to their resident in case an fpl franchise agreement provides the respective municipality the right to buy the electrical asset serving local resident at the end of the agreement however during the term of franchise agreement which is typically year the municipality or county agrees not to form it own utility and fpl ha the right to offer electric service to resident fpl currently hold franchise agreement with various municipality and county in florida with varying expiration date through none of franchise agreement expire in two expire in and expire during the period through these franchise agreement cover approximately of fpl retail customer base in florida negotiation are ongoing to renew the franchise agreement that expire in fpl considers it franchise to be adequate for the conduct of it business fpl also provides service to other municipality and to unincorporated area within it service area without franchise agreement pursuant to the general obligation to serve public utility fpl relies upon florida law for access to public right of way any customer may elect to provide own electric service fpl effectively must compete for an individual customer business practical matter few customer provide their own service at the present time since fpl cost of service is substantially lower than the cost of self generation for the vast majority of customer changing technology economic condition and other factor could alter the favorable relative cost position that fpl currently enjoys however fpl seek matter of strategy to ensure that it delivers superior value in the form of high reliability low bill and excellent customer service in addition to self generation by residential commercial and industrial customer fpl also face competition from other supplier of electrical energy to wholesale customer and from alternative energy source in each of and operating revenue from wholesale and industrial customer combined represented approximately and respectively of fpl total operating revenue the fpsc promotes cost competitiveness in the building of new steam and solar generating capacity of mw or greater by requiring investor owned electric utility including fpl to issue an rfp except the fpsc determines that an exception from the rfp process is in the public interest the rfp process allows independent power producer and others to bid to supply the new generating capacity if bidder ha the most cost effective alternative meet other criterion such financial viability and demonstrates adequate expertise and experience in building and or operating generating capacity of the type proposed the investor owned electric utility would seek to negotiate purchased power agreement with the selected bidder and request that the fpsc approve the term of the purchased power agreement and if appropriate provide the required authorization for the construction of the bidder generating capacity new nuclear power plant are exempt from the rfp requirement see fpl source of generation nuclear operation below customer and revenuefpl primary source of operating revenue is from it retail customer base it also serf limited number of wholesale customer within florida fpl revenue from wholesale sale increased in both and primarily due to an increase in contracted load served under existing and new wholesale contract the percentage of fpl operating revenue and customer account by customer class were follows for both retail and wholesale customer the price or rate that fpl may charge are approved by regulatory body by the fpsc in the case of retail customer and by the ferc in the case of wholesale customer in general under and florida law regulated rate are intended to cover the cost of providing service including reasonable rate of return on invested capital since of contentsthe regulatory body have authority to determine the relevant cost of providing service and the appropriate rate of return on capital employed there can be no guarantee that fpl will be able to earn any particular rate of return or recover all of it cost through regulated rate see fpl regulation below fpl seek to maintain attractive rate for it customer since rate are largely cost based maintaining low rate requires strategy focused on developing and maintaining low cost position including the implementation of idea generated from the cost saving initiative discussed common benchmark used in the electric power industry for comparing rate across company is the price of kwh of consumption per month for residential customer fpl average bill for kwh of monthly residential usage wa the lowest among reporting electric utility within florida indicated below power deliveryfpl provides service to it customer through an integrated transmission and distribution system that link it generation facility to it customer fpl also maintains interconnection facility with neighboring utility and non utility generator inside it service territory enabling it to buy and sell wholesale electricity and to enhance the reliability of it own network and support the reliability of neighboring network fpl transmission system carry high voltage electricity from it generation facility to substation the electricity is stepped to lower voltage level and is sent through the distribution system to it customer key element of fpl strategy is to provide highly reliable service to it customer the transmission and distribution system is susceptible to interruption or outage from wide variety of source including weather animal and vegetation interference traffic accident equipment failure and many others and fpl seek to reduce or eliminate outage where economically practical and to restore service rapidly when outage occur common industry benchmark for transmission and distribution system reliability is the system average interruption duration index saidi which represents the number of minute the average customer is without power during time period for the five year fpl average annual saidi wa the best of the investor owned utility in florida fpl ha accelerated it existing storm hardening and reliability program to continue strengthening it infrastructure tropical storm and hurricane also part of it commitment to building smarter more reliable and efficient electric infrastructure fpl ha installed approximately million smart meter and more than other intelligent device throughout the electric grid fpl system capability and loadat december fpl resource for serving load consisted of mw of which mw were from fpl owned facility see item property generation facility and approximately mw were available through purchased power agreement see fpl source of generation purchased power below fpl customer usage and operating revenue are typically higher during the summer month largely due to the prevalent use of air conditioning in fpl service territory occasionally unusually cold temperature during the winter month result in significant increase in electricity usage for short period of time the highest peak load fpl ha served to date wa mw which occurred on january fpl adequate resource available at the time of this peak to meet customer demand fpl projected reserve margin for the summer of is approximately this reserve margin is expected to be achieved through the combination of available output from fpl active generation unit purchased power agreement and the capability to reduce peak demand through the implementation of demand side management program including load management which wa estimated at december to be capable of reducing demand by approximately mw and energy efficiency and conservation program see fpl source of generation fossil operation and nuclear operation below regarding generation project currently under construction of contentsfpl source of generationfpl relies upon mix of fuel source for it generation facility along with purchased power in order to maintain the flexibility to achieve more economical fuel mix by responding to market and

restrict the output of some existing facility limit the availability and use of some fuel required for the production of electricity require additional pollution control equipment and otherwise increase cost increase capital expenditure and limit or eliminate certain operation there are significant capital operating and other cost associated with compliance with these environmental statute rule and regulation and those cost could be even more significant in the future result of new requirement the current trend toward more stringent standard and stricter or more expansive application of existing environmental regulation for example among other new potential or pending change are federal regulation of emission under the clean power plan and state and federal regulation of the use of hydraulic fracturing or similar technology to drill for natural gas and related compound used by nee gas infrastructure business violation of current or future law rule regulation or other standard could expose nee and fpl to regulatory and legal proceeding dispute with and legal challenge by third party and potentially significant civil fine criminal penalty and other sanction proceeding could include for example litigation regarding property damage personal injury common law nuisance and enforcement by citizen or governmental authority of environmental requirement such air water and soil quality standard nee and fpl business could be negatively affected by federal or state law or regulation mandating new or additional limit on the production of greenhouse gas emission federal or state law or regulation may be adopted that would impose new or additional limit on the emission of greenhouse gas including but not limited to and methane from electric generation unit using fossil fuel like coal and natural gas although it is currently subject to stay issued by the supreme court the clean power plan is an example of such new regulation at the federal level the potential effect of greenhouse gas emission limit on nee and fpl electric generation unit are subject to significant uncertainty based on among other thing the timing of the implementation of any new requirement the required level of emission reduction the nature of any market based or tax based mechanism adopted to facilitate reduction the relative availability of greenhouse gas emission reduction offset the development of cost effective commercial scale carbon capture and storage technology and supporting regulation and liability mitigation measure and the range of available compliance alternative while nee and fpl electric generation unit emit greenhouse gas at lower rate of emission than most of the electric generation sector the result of operation of nee and fpl could be materially adversely affected to the extent that new federal or state law or regulation impose any new greenhouse gas emission limit any future limit on greenhouse gas emission could create substantial additional cost in the form of tax or emission allowance make some of nee and fpl electric generation unit uneconomical to operate in the long term require significant capital investment in carbon capture and storage technology fuel switching or the replacement of high emitting generation facility with lower emitting generation facility or affect the availability or cost of fossil fuel there can be no assurance that nee or fpl would be able to completely recover any such cost or investment which could have material adverse effect on their business financial condition result of operation and prospect extensive federal regulation of the operation of nee and fpl expose nee and fpl to significant and increasing compliance cost and may also expose them to substantial monetary penalty and other sanction for compliance failure nee and fpl are subject to extensive federal regulation which generally imposes significant and increasing compliance cost on nee and fpl operation additionally any actual or alleged compliance failure could result in significant cost and other potentially adverse effect of regulatory investigation proceeding settlement decision and claim including among other item potentially significant monetary penalty an example under the energy policy act of nee and fpl owner and operator of bulk power transmission system and or electric generation facility are subject to mandatory reliability standard compliance with these mandatory reliability standard may subject nee and fpl to higher operating cost and may result in increased capital expenditure if fpl or nee is found not to be in compliance with these standard it may incur substantial monetary of contentspenalties and other sanction both the cost of regulatory compliance and the cost that may be imposed result of any actual or alleged compliance failure could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect change in tax law well judgment and

financial condition result of operation and prospect can be materially adversely affected by weather condition including but not limited to the impact of severe weather weather condition directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuel and affect the price of energy and energy related commodity in addition severe weather and natural disaster such hurricane flood tornado icing event and earthquake can be destructive and cause power outage and property damage reduce revenue affect the availability of fuel and water and require nee and fpl to incur additional cost for example to restore service and repair damaged facility to obtain replacement power and to access available financing source furthermore nee and fpl physical plant could be placed at greater risk of damage should change in the global climate produce unusual variation in temperature and weather pattern resulting in more intense frequent and extreme weather event abnormal level of precipitation and particularly relevant to fpl change in sea level fpl operates in the east and lower west coast of florida an area that historically ha been prone to severe weather event such hurricane disruption or failure of electric generation transmission or distribution system or natural gas production transmission storage or distribution system in the event of hurricane tornado or other severe weather event or otherwise could prevent nee and fpl from operating their business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequence described above any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect at fpl and other business of nee where cost recovery is available recovery of cost to restore service and repair damaged facility is or may be subject to regulatory approval and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the cost incurred could have material adverse effect on nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect change in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facility including but not limited to neer wind and solar facility for example the level of wind resource affect the revenue produced by wind generation facility because the level of wind and solar resource are variable and difficult to predict neer result of operation for individual wind and solar facility specifically and nee result of operation generally may vary significantly from period to period depending on the level of contentsof available resource to the extent that resource are not available at planned level the financial result from these facility may be le than expected threat of terrorism and catastrophic event that could result from terrorism cyber attack or individual and or group attempting to disrupt nee and fpl business or the business of third party may materially adversely affect nee and fpl business financial condition result of operation and prospect nee and fpl are subject to the potentially adverse operating and financial effect of terrorist act and threat well cyber attack and other disruptive activity of individual or group there have been cyber attack on energy infrastructure such substation gas pipeline and related asset in the past and there may be such attack in the future nee and fpl generation transmission and distribution facility fuel storage facility information technology system and other infrastructure facility and system could be direct target of or otherwise be materially adversely affected by such activity terrorist act cyber attack or other similar event affecting nee and fpl system and facility or those of third party on which nee and fpl rely could harm nee and fpl business for example by limiting their ability to generate purchase or transmit power natural gas or other energy related commodity by limiting their ability to bill customer and collect and process payment and by delaying their development and construction of new generation distribution or transmission facility or capital improvement to existing facility these event and governmental action in response could result in material decrease in revenue significant additional cost for example to repair asset implement additional security requirement or maintain or acquire insurance significant fine and penalty and reputational damage could materially adversely affect nee and fpl operation for example by contributing to disruption of supply and market for natural gas oil and other fuel and could impair nee and fpl ability to raise capital for example by contributing to financial instability and lower economic activity in addition the implementation of security guideline and measure ha resulted in and is expected to continue to result in increased cost such event or action may materially adversely affect nee and fpl business

aspect of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instrument see note financial instrument accounting standard update critical accounting policy and estimatesnee and fpl significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement which were prepared under gaap critical accounting policy are those that nee and fpl believe are both most important to the portrayal of their financial condition and result of operation and require complex subjective judgment often result of the need to make estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain judgment and uncertainty affecting the application of those policy may result in materially different amount being reported under different condition or using different assumption nee and fpl consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that are involved in preparing their consolidated financial statement of contentsaccounting for derivative and hedging activitiesnee and fpl use derivative instrument primarily swap option future and forward to manage the commodity price risk inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity well interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and forecasted debt issuance and borrowing in addition nee through neer us derivative to optimize the value of power generation and gas infrastructure asset and engages in power and gas marketing and trading activity to take advantage of expected future favorable price movement nature of accounting estimatesaccounting pronouncement require the use of fair value accounting if certain condition are met which requires significant judgment to measure the fair value of asset and liability this applies not only to traditional financial derivative instrument but to any contract having the accounting characteristic of derivative much of the existing accounting guidance related to derivative focus on when certain contract for the purchase and sale of power and certain fuel supply contract can be excluded from derivative accounting rule however the guidance doe not address all contract issue result significant judgment must be used in applying derivative accounting guidance to contract in the event change in interpretation occur it is possible that contract that currently are excluded from derivative accounting rule would have to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with change in the fair value recorded in the statement of income assumption and accounting approachnee and fpl derivative instrument when required to be marked to market are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value fair value for some of the longer term contract where liquid market are not available are derived through internally developed model which estimate the fair value of contract by calculating the present value of the difference between the contract price and the forward price forward price represent the price at which buyer or seller could contract today to purchase or sell commodity at future date the near term forward market for electricity is generally liquid and therefore the price in the early year of the forward curve reflect observable market quote however in the later year the market is much le liquid and forward price curve must be developed using factor including the forward price for the commodity used fuel to generate electricity the expected system heat rate which measure the efficiency of power plant in converting fuel to electricity in the region where the purchase or sale take place and fundamental forecast of expected spot price based on modeled supply and demand in the region nee estimate the fair value of interest rate and foreign currency derivative using discounted cash flow valuation technique based on the net amount of estimated future cash inflow and outflow related to the derivative agreement the assumption in these model are critical since any change therein could have significant impact on the fair value of the derivative at fpl substantially all change in the fair value of energy derivative transaction are deferred regulatory asset or liability until the contract are settled and upon settlement any gain or loss are passed through the fuel clause see note in nee non rate regulated operation predominantly neer essentially all change in the derivative fair value for power purchase and sale fuel sale and trading activity are recognized on net basis in operating revenue fuel purchase used in the production of electricity are recognized in fuel purchased power and interchange expense and the equity method investees related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in nee consolidated statement of income for those interest rate and foreign currency transaction accounted for cash flow hedge much of the effect of change in fair value are reflected in oci component of common shareholder equity rather than being recognized in current earnings for those transaction accounted for fair value hedge the effect of change in fair value are reflected in current earnings offset by change in the fair value of the item being hedged certain hedging transaction at neer are entered into economic hedge but the transaction do not meet the requirement for hedge accounting hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting ha been discontinued change in the fair value of those transaction are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statement of income resulting in earnings volatility these change in fair value are captured in the non qualifying hedge category in computing adjusted earnings this could be significant to neer result because the economic offset to the position are not marked to market consequence nee net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically linked transaction for example gain loss in the non qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivative is offset by decrease increase in the fair value of related physical asset position in the portfolio or contract which are not marked to market under gaap for this reason nee management view result expressed excluding the unrealized mark to market impact of the non qualifying hedge meaningful measure of current period performance for additional information regarding derivative instrument see note overview and energy marketing and trading and market risk sensitivity of contentsaccounting for pension benefitsnee sponsor qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employee of nee and it subsidiary management belief that based on actuarial assumption and the well funded status of the pension plan nee will not be required to make any cash contribution to the qualified pension plan in the near future the qualified pension plan ha fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefit under the plan nee allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to it subsidiary annually using specific criterion nature of accounting estimatesfor the pension plan the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the december measurement date of all benefit attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date the amount of benefit to be paid depends on number of future event incorporated into the pension benefit formula including estimate of the average life of employee survivor and average year of service rendered the projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumption concerning future interest rate and future employee compensation level nee derives pension income from actuarial calculation based on the plan provision and various management assumption including discount rate rate of increase in compensation level and expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption and accounting approachaccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet with change in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholder equity in the year in which the change occur since nee is the plan sponsor and it subsidiary do not have separate right to the plan asset or direct obligation to their employee this accounting guidance is reflected at nee and not allocated to the subsidiary the portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gain and loss and prior service cost or credit that are estimated to be allocable to fpl net periodic income cost in future period and that otherwise would be recorded in aoci are classified regulatory asset and liability at nee in accordance with regulatory treatment net periodic pension income is included in expense and is calculated using number of actuarial assumption those assumption for the year ended december and include salary expected long term rate of return ________________ in an expected long term rate of return of is presented net of investment management fee in developing these assumption nee evaluated input including other qualitative and quantitative factor from it actuary and consultant well information available in the marketplace in addition for the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset nee considered different model capital market return assumption and historical return for portfolio with an equity bond asset mix similar to it pension fund well it pension fund historical compounded return nee belief that is reasonable long term rate of return net of investment management fee on it pension plan asset nee will continue to evaluate all of it actuarial assumption including it expected rate of return at least annually and will adjust them appropriate nee utilizes in it determination of pension income market related valuation of plan asset this market related valuation reduces year to year volatility and recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period following the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return realized on those plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value of plan asset will be affected previously deferred gain or loss are recognized such gain and loss together with other difference between actual result and the estimate used in the actuarial valuation are deferred and recognized in determining pension income only to the extent they exceed of the greater of projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan asset of contentsthe following table illustrates the effect on net periodic income of changing the critical actuarial assumption discussed above while holding all other assumption constant decrease in periodic income change inassumption nee fpl million expected long term rate of return discount salary nee also utilizes actuarial assumption about mortality to help estimate obligation of the pension plan nee ha adopted the latest revised mortality table and mortality improvement scale released by the society of actuary which adoption did not have material impact on the pension plan obligation see note carrying value of long lived assetsnee evaluates long lived asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable nature of accounting estimatesthe amount of future net cash flow the timing of the cash flow and the determination of an appropriate interest rate all involve estimate and judgment about future event in particular the aggregate amount of cash flow determines whether an impairment exists and the timing of the cash flow is critical in determining fair value because each assessment is based on the fact and circumstance associated with each long lived asset the effect of change in assumption can not be generalized assumption and accounting approachan impairment loss is required to be recognized if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow associated with that asset the impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the asset fair value in most instance the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flow using an appropriate interest rate see note nonrecurring fair value measurement and management discussion neer
