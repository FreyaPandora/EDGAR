we are constantly innovating and hold significant number of patent copyright trade secret and other intellectual property that protect those innovation in numerous country while no single piece of intellectual property is individually material to our business whole our intellectual property is important to our operation and continued technological development additionally we hold number of trademark and service mark that are important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace raw material service and supply we purchase wide variety of raw material part supply energy freight transportation and other service from numerous supplier to manufacture our product the raw material primarily include steel aluminum resin copper lead and precious metal we have not experienced any significant shortage of raw material and normally not carry substantial inventory of these raw material in excess of level reasonably required to meet our production requirement cost are expected to remain elevated due to the price of commodity and the continuing existence of tariff we purchase system component and part from supplier global semiconductor supply shortage is wide ranging effect across multiple industry particularly the automotive industry refer to item risk factor for discussion of this risk in instance we purchase system component part and supply from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption the inability or unwillingness of these source to provide with part and supply could have material adverse effect on our production capacity combined purchase from our two largest supplier were approximately of our total purchase in each of the year ended december and and approximately of our total purchase in the year ended december refer to item risk factor for further discussion of these risk environmental and regulatory mattersautomotive criterion emission control our product are subject to law and regulation globally that require to control certain non ghg automotive emission including vehicle and engine exhaust emission standard vehicle evaporative emission standard and onboard diagnostic obd system requirement emission requirement have become more stringent result of stricter standard and new diagnostic requirement that have come into force in many market around the world often with very little harmonization while we believe all of our product are designed and manufactured in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emission requirement regulatory authority may conduct ongoing evaluation of product from all manufacturer the federal government through the epa imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission control requirement on vehicle sold in the the california air resource board carb likewise imposes stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standard these emission control standard will likely increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance the clean air act permit state that have area with air quality compliance issue to adopt california emission standard in lieu of federal requirement fourteen state and the district of columbia have adopted california emission standard and there is possibility that additional jurisdiction could adopt california emission requirement in the future the canadian federal government current vehicle pollutant emission requirement are generally aligned with federal requirement of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieseach model year we must obtain certification that our vehicle and heavy duty engine will meet emission requirement of the epa we can sell vehicle in the and canada and of carb before we can sell vehicle in california and other state that have adopted the california emission requirement in certain area within china began implementation of the china emission standard china requirement china combine element of both european union eu and standard and increase the time and mileage period over which manufacturer are responsible for vehicle emission performance nationwide implementation of china for new registration occurred in january and the more stringent china is expected to be implemented in july for additional information refer to item risk factor brazil ha approved set of national emission standard referred to to be implemented in and to be implemented from onward standard include exhaust tailpipe gas durability for emission evaporative emission and noise limit additional obd requirement and phase in for onboard refueling vapor recovery system standard include real drive emission target for real driving emission and reduce corporate exhaust limit every two year some of the requirement are aligned with those of the epa result of the sale of the opel vauxhall business gm vehicle presence in europe is smaller gm may still be affected by action taken by regulator related both to opel vauxhall vehicle sold before the sale of the opel vauxhall business well to other vehicle gm continues to sell in europe in the eu increased scrutiny of compliance with emission standard may result in change to these standard including implementation of real driving emission test well stricter interpretation or redefinition of these standard and more rigorous enforcement for example our former german subsidiary ha participated in continuing discussion with german and european authority concerning emission control system for additional information refer to note to our consolidated financial statement automotive fuel economy and greenhouse gas emission in the nhtsa promulgates and enforces corporate average fuel economy cafe standard for three separate fleet domestically produced car imported car and light duty truck manufacturer are subject to substantial civil penalty if they fail to meet the applicable cafe standard in any model year considering all available credit for the preceding five model year expected credit for the three succeeding model year and credit obtained from other manufacturer in addition to federal cafe standard the epa promulgates and enforces ghg emission standard which are effectively fuel economy standard the majority of vehicle ghg emission are carbon dioxide emission that are emitted in direct proportion to the amount of fuel consumed by vehicle in march the epa and nhtsa issued rule setting fuel economy and ghg emission standard for the light duty vehicle through the model year which is currently being challenged through litigation on january president biden issued executive order directing the epa and nhtsa to by july consider publishing proposed rule suspending revising or rescinding those standard and ha also permitted the department of justice to seek to stay or dispose of litigation challenging those standard the epa and nhtsa also regulate the fuel efficiency and ghg emission of medium and heavy duty vehicle imposing more stringent standard over time in addition carb ha asserted the right to promulgate and enforce it state ghg standard for motor vehicle and other state have asserted the right to adopt carb standard carb regulation previously stated that compliance with the epa light duty program is deemed compliance with carb standard however on december carb amended this regulation to state that in the event the epa were to alter federal ghg stringency which it ha compliance with the epa ghg emission standard will no longer be deemed compliance with carb separate requirement in september nhtsa and the epa issued rule asserting that california is preempted from regulating ghg emission which is currently being challenged through litigation result depending on the outcome of the federal cafe and ghg rulemakings and related litigation and the finality of carb regulatory amendment in the future gm might be required to meet california ghg standard that are different than the epa standard carb ha also imposed the requirement that increasing percentage of zero emission vehicle zevs must be sold in california the clean air act permit state to adopt california emission standard and have adopted the zev requirement in september the epa revoked the waiver it granted to california that permitted it zev program and nhtsa also asserted preemption of california zev program both the epa and nhtsa action are currently being challenged through litigation depending on the outcome of that litigation there is possibility that additional jurisdiction could adopt california zev requirement in the future on january president biden issued executive order directing epa and nhtsa to by april consider publishing proposed rule suspending revising or rescinding epa and nhtsa september action and ha also permitted the department of justice to stay or dispose of litigation related to preemption of state ghg and zev standard on of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesfebruary the department of justice filed motion seeking to hold these preemption case in abeyance pending implementation of executive order in canada light and heavy duty ghg regulation are currently patterned after the epa ghg emission standard however the canadian government is conducting mid term review of it to model year light duty ghg standard and there is an increased risk that future canadian light duty ghg regulation may not be aligned with the revised epa regulation in addition the canadian province of quebec ha zev requirement regulating the to model year largely based on california program requirement the province of british columbia also finalized similar zev regulation in july that cover the to model year there is also the risk that the federal government or other province in canada may pursue the implementation of additional zev requirement in the future china ha two fuel economy requirement for passenger vehicle an individual vehicle pas fail type approval requirement and fleet average fuel consumption requirement with focus on the fleet average program the current china phase fleet average fuel consumption requirement which went into effect in is based on curb weight with full compliance required by china phase ha continued subsidy for plug in hybrid battery electric and fuel cell vehicle which are referred to new energy vehicle nevs subsidy for nev have been extended to the end of china phase ha been developed with planned start in and full compliance is required by in addition china ha established an nev mandate that will require passenger car manufacturer to produce certain volume of nevs to generate credit in and beyond to offset internal combustion engine vehicle production volume the number of credit per car is based on the level of electric range and energy efficiency with the goal of increasing nev volume penetration uncommitted nev credit may be used to assist compliance with the fleet average fuel consumption requirement china ha issued nev credit target and and is setting new nev credit target aiming at further increasing volume of nevs in and in brazil the secretary of industry and development promulgates and enforces cafe standard and ha enforced new cafe program for the period october to september and october to september for light duty and mid size truck and sport utility vehicle suv including diesel vehicle imposing more stringent standard for each period regulator in other jurisdiction have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulation if regulator in these jurisdiction seek to impose and enforce standard that are misaligned with market condition we may be forced to take various action to increase market support program for certain vehicle and curtail production of others in order to achieve compliance we regularly evaluate our current and future product plan and strategy for compliance with fuel economy and ghg regulation industrial environmental control our operation are subject to wide range of environmental protection law including those regulating air emission water discharge waste management and environmental cleanup certain environmental statute require that responsible party fund remediation action regardless of fault legality of original disposal or ownership of disposal site under certain circumstance these law impose joint and several liability well liability for related damage to natural resource to mitigate the effect of our worldwide operation on the environment we are embracing sustainability program focused on reducing ghg emission water consumption and discharge and waste disposal at december of waste material generated in our manufacturing facility across the globe are composted reused or recycled we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted million metric ton of waste from landfill in and resulted in million metric ton of ghg emission avoided in global manufacturing operation in addition to reducing our impact on the environment our waste reduction commitment generate income from the sale of production by product reduce our use of raw material and help to reduce the risk and financial liability associated with waste disposal we continue our effort to increase our use of renewable energy improve our energy efficiency and work to drive growth and scale of renewables we are committed to meeting the electricity need of our operation worldwide with renewable energy by pulling forward our previous commitment by five year and plan to be carbon neutral by in our global product and operation supported by commitment to science based target in addition to our carbon goal the company worked with the environmental defense fund to develop shared vision of an all electric future and an aspiration to eliminate tailpipe emission from new light duty vehicle by through december we implemented project and signed renewable energy contract globally that brought our total renewable energy capacity to over one gigawatt by which represents approximately of our electricity use and over of our global electricity use in we executed our largest of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesgreen tariff to date with dte energy company sourcing megawatt hour of renewable energy that will begin supplying in early additionally in we executed our largest power purchase agreement to date with megawatt of solar electricity supplying our operation starting in we continue to seek opportunity for diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind solar and landfill gas in energy star certified two assembly plant one in canada through natural resource canada and one in the well five building in the for superior energy management we also met the epa energy star challenge for industry epa challenge at six additional site by reducing energy intensity an average of at these site within three year to meet the epa challenge industrial site must reduce energy intensity by within five year period in total gm owned manufacturing site have met the epa challenge with many site achieving the goal multiple time for total of recognition additionally we received recognition from the department of energy doe of ready status for facility the doe ready program is self guided approach for facility to establish an energy management system and self attest to the structure of iso voluntary global standard for energy management system in industrial commercial and institutional facility these sustainability effort reduce our operational expense and are part of our approach to improve the sustainability of our operation by aligning our business strategy with aggressive environmental goal and reduction target collecting accurate data and publicly reporting progress our target chemical regulation we continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulation to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business supplier and the automotive industry globally governmental agency continue to introduce new legislation and regulation related to the selection and use of chemical by mandating broad prohibition or restriction and implementing green chemistry life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiative these initiative give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substance and potentially affect automobile manufacturer responsibility for vehicle component at the end of vehicle life well chemical selection for product development and manufacturing global treaty and initiative such the stockholm basel and rotterdam convention on chemical and waste and the minamata convention on mercury are driving chemical regulation across signatory country in addition more global jurisdiction are establishing substance standard with regard to vehicle interior air quality chemical regulation are increasing in north america in the the epa is moving forward with risk analysis and management of high priority chemical under the authority of the lautenberg chemical safety for the century act and several state have chemical management regulation that can affect vehicle design such the california and washington law banning the use of copper in brake friction material chemical restriction in canada continue to steadily progress result of environment and climate change canada chemical management plan to ass existing substance and implement risk management control on any chemical deemed toxic china prohibits the use of several chemical substance in vehicle there are also various regulation in china stipulating the requirement for chemical management among other thing these regulation restrict the use import and export of various chemical substance the failure of our joint venture partner or our supplier to comply with these regulation could disrupt production in china or prevent our joint venture partner from selling the affected product in the china market these emerging law and regulation will potentially lead to increase in cost and supply chain complexity we believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirement or expect to be materially in compliance by the required date vehicle safety requirement the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act of the safety act regulates the vehicle and item of motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell the safety act prohibits the sale in the united state of any new vehicle or equipment that doe not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standard established by nhtsa meeting or exceeding the many safety standard is costly global compliance and non governmental assessment requirement continue to evolve and grow more complex and lack harmonization globally the safety act further requires that if we or nhtsa determine vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment doe not comply with safety standard or that vehicle or equipment contains defect that pose an unreasonable safety risk we must conduct safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicle we or nhtsa determine safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our vehicle the cost of such recall campaign could be substantial of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesother national requirement outside of the many country have established vehicle safety standard and regulation and are likely to adopt additional more stringent requirement in the future the european general safety regulation ha introduced un ece regulation which are required for the european type approval process globally government generally have been adopting un ece based regulation with some variation to address local concern any difference between north american and un ece based regulation can add complexity and cost to vehicle development and we continue to support effort to harmonize regulation to reduce complexity new safety and recall requirement in various country around the world including in china brazil and gulf cooperation council country also may add substantial cost and complexity to our safety and field action activity globally in canada vehicle regulatory requirement are currently aligned with regulation however under the canadian motor vehicle safety act recall threshold are different and the minister of transport ha broad power to order manufacturer to submit notice of defect or non compliance when the minister considers it to be in the interest of safety further various government are beginning to mandate call and other feature that can be market specific and add complexity and increase our cost of compliance globally crash test rating and new car assessment program organization in various region around the world including in the rate and compare motor vehicle through various new car assessment program ncaps to provide consumer and business with additional information about the safety of new vehicle ncaps use crash test and other evaluation that are different than is required by applicable regulation and use star to rate vehicle safety with five star awarded for the highest rating and one

the most material risk factor applicable to these risk factor are not necessarily in the order of importance or probability of occurrence risk related to our competition and strategyif we do not deliver new product service and customer experience in response to increased competition and changing consumer preference in the automotive industry our business could suffer we believe that the automotive industry will continue to experience significant change in the coming year particularly traditional automotive original equipment manufacturer oems shift resource to the development of electric vehicle in addition to our traditional competitor we must also be responsive to the entrance of non traditional participant in the automotive industry industry participant are disrupting the historic business model of our industry through the introduction of new technology product service direct to consumer sale channel method of transportation and vehicle ownership it is strategic imperative that we succeed in driving the technological disruption occurring in our industry including consumer adoption of electric vehicle and commercialization of autonomous vehicle to successfully execute our long term strategy we must continue to develop new product and service including product and service that are outside of our historically core business such autonomous and electric vehicle digital service and transportation service the process of designing and developing new technology product and service is complex costly and uncertain and requires extensive capital investment and the ability to retain and recruit the best talent there can be no assurance that advance in technology will occur in timely or feasible way that others will not acquire similar or superior technology sooner than we do or that we will acquire technology on an exclusive basis or at significant price advantage if we do not adequately prepare for and respond to new kind of technological innovation market development and changing customer need our sale profitability and long term competitiveness may be harmed our ability to maintain profitability is dependent upon our ability to timely fund and introduce new and improved vehicle model including electric vehicle that are able to attract sufficient number of consumer we operate in very competitive industry with market participant routinely introducing new and improved vehicle model and feature designed to meet rapidly evolving consumer expectation producing new and improved vehicle model including electric vehicle that preserve our reputation for designing building and selling safe high quality car and truck is critical to our long term profitability successful launch of our new vehicle are critical to our short term profitability the new vehicle development process generally take two year or more and number of factor may lengthen that time period because of this product development cycle and the various element that may contribute to consumer acceptance of new vehicle design including competitor product introduction technological innovation fuel price general economic condition infrastructure and change in quality safety reliability and styling demand and preference an initial product concept or design may not result in vehicle that generates sale in sufficient quantity and at high enough price to be profitable our high proportion of fixed cost both due to our significant investment in property plant and equipment well other requirement of our collective bargaining agreement which limit our flexibility to adjust personnel cost to change in demand for our product may further exacerbate the risk associated with incorrectly assessing demand for our vehicle our near term profitability is dependent upon the success of our current line of full size suv and pickup truck while we offer portfolio of car crossover suv and truck and we have announced significant plan to design build and sell broad portfolio of electric vehicle we currently recognize higher profit margin on our suv and truck our near term success is dependent upon our ability to sell higher margin vehicle in sufficient volume any near term shift in consumer preference toward smaller more fuel efficient vehicle whether result of increase in the price of oil or any sustained shortage of oil including result of global political instability concern about climate change or other reason could weaken the demand for our higher margin vehicle more stringent fuel economy regulation could also impact our ability to sell these vehicle of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiarieswe operate in highly competitive industry that ha excess manufacturing capacity and attempt by our competitor to sell more vehicle could have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result the global automotive industry is highly competitive in term of the quality innovation new technology pricing fuel economy reliability safety customer service and financial service offered additionally overall manufacturing capacity in the industry far exceeds current demand many manufacturer including gm have relatively high fixed labor cost well limitation on their ability to close facility and reduce fixed cost in light of such excess capacity and high fixed cost many industry participant have attempted to sell more vehicle by providing subsidized financing or leasing program offering marketing incentive or reducing vehicle price result we may be required to offer similar incentive that may result in vehicle price that do not offset cost increase or the impact of adverse currency fluctuation which could affect our profitability our competitor may also seek to benefit from economy of scale by consolidating or entering into other strategic agreement such alliance or joint venture intended to enhance their competitiveness manufacturer in country that have lower production cost such china and india have become competitor in key emerging market and have announced their intention to export their product to established market low cost alternative to established entry level automobile in addition foreign government may decide to implement tax and other policy that favor their domestic manufacturer at the expense of international manufacturer including gm and it joint venture partner these action have had and are expected to continue to have significant negative effect on our vehicle pricing market share and operating result our long term strategy is dependent upon our ability to deliver broad portfolio of electric vehicle that will drive consumer adoption the production and profitable sale of electric vehicle ha become increasingly important to our long term business we accelerate our transition to an all electric future in we announced the commitment of billion in investment in electric and autonomous vehicle technology through with plan to launch new electric vehicle model globally in that timeframe our electric vehicle strategy is dependent on our ability to deliver broad portfolio of electric vehicle reduce the cost associated with the manufacture of electric vehicle increase vehicle range and the energy density of our battery license and monetize our proprietary platform develop new software and service and leverage our scale manufacturing capability and synergy with existing internal combustion engine vehicle in addition consumer adoption of electric vehicle will be critical to the success of our strategy consumer adoption of electric vehicle could be impacted by numerous factor including the breadth of the portfolio of electric vehicle available perception about electric vehicle feature quality safety performance and cost relative to internal combustion engine vehicle the range over which electric vehicle may be driven on full battery charge availability of high fuel economy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility in the cost of fuel government regulation and economic incentive and the proliferation of robust open standard electric vehicle charging ecosystem if we are unable to successfully deliver on our electric vehicle strategy it could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect our autonomous vehicle strategy is

vehicle and significant competition from both established automotive company and technology company some of which may have more resource and capital to devote to autonomous vehicle technology than we do in addition we face risk related to the commercial deployment of autonomous vehicle on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standard and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state or provincial regulation to the extent accident cybersecurity breach or other adverse event associated with our autonomous driving system occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny and further regulation and it could deter consumer adoption of autonomous vehicle technology any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect risk related to our operationsthe covid pandemic may disrupt our business and operation which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation pandemic epidemic or disease outbreak in the or globally may disrupt our business which could materially affect our result of operation financial condition liquidity and future expectation the covid outbreak ha caused significant disruption to the global economy including the automotive industry and ha had material impact on our business discussed in detail in part ii item md however the full extent to which the covid pandemic will impact our operation will depend on future development including the duration and severity of the outbreak any subsequent outbreak and the timing and efficacy of any available vaccine future development are highly uncertain and can not be predicted with confidence and may adversely impact our global supply chain and global manufacturing operation and cause to suspend our operation in the and elsewhere in particular if of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariescovid continues to spread or re emerges particularly in north america where our profit are most concentrated resulting in prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restriction we could experience among other thing global supply disruption labor disruption an inability to manufacture an inability to sell to our customer decline in showroom traffic and customer demand during and following the pandemic customer default on automobile loan and lease lower than expected pricing on vehicle sold at auction and an impaired ability to access credit and the capital market we may also be subject to enhanced legal risk including potential litigation related to the covid pandemic we also have substantial cash requirement going forward including ongoing cash cost including payment associated with previously announced vehicle recall the settlement of multi district litigation and other recall related contingency payment to service debt and other long term obligation including mandatory contribution to our pension plan and capital expenditure and payment for engineering and product development activity our ability to meet these cash requirement may be negatively impacted by the ongoing covid pandemic any resulting financial impact can not be reasonably estimated at this time but the covid pandemic could have material impact on our business financial condition and result of operation going forward for further discussion of the impact of the covid pandemic on our liquidity refer to the liquidity and capital resource section in part ii item md our business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sale volume which can be volatile because we have high proportion of relatively fixed structural cost

this item risk factor barrier to trade and other global economic condition for discussion of economic and market trend see the overview section in part ii item md our significant business in china subject to unique operational competitive and regulatory risk maintaining strong position in the chinese market is key component of our global growth strategy our business in china is subject to aggressive competition from many of the largest global manufacturer and numerous domestic manufacturer well non traditional market participant such domestic technology company in addition our success in china depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preference driven by advancement related to electric vehicle infotainment and other new technology our ability to fully deploy our technology in china may be impacted by evolving law and regulation in the and china increased competition increased china trade restriction and weakening economic condition in china among other thing may result in price reduction reduced sale profitability and margin and challenge to gain or hold market share in addition chinese regulator have implemented increasingly aggressive green policy initiative requiring oems to reduce the average emission and average fuel consumption of their product and to achieve quota for the sale of electric vehicle which have challenging lead time certain risk and uncertainty of business in china are solely within the control of the chinese government and chinese law regulates the scope of our investment and business conducted within china in order to maintain access to the chinese market we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirement that are unique to the chinese market at time with challenging lead time to implement such requirement these action may increase the cost of doing business in china and reduce our profitability significant amount of our operation are conducted by joint venture that we can not operate solely for our benefit many of our operation primarily in china and korea well our battery manufacturing operation with lg chem are carried by joint venture in joint venture we share ownership and management of company with one or more party who may not have the goal strategy priority or resource we do and may compete with outside the joint venture joint venture are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co owner rather than for our exclusive benefit operating business joint venture often requires additional organizational formality well time consuming procedure for sharing information and making decision that must further take into consideration our partner interest in joint venture we are required to foster our relationship with our co owner well promote the overall success of the joint venture and if co owner change relationship deteriorate or strategic objective diverge our success in the joint venture may be materially adversely affected the benefit from successful joint venture are shared among the co owner therefore we do not receive all the benefit from our successful joint venture in addition because we share ownership and management with one or more party we may have limited control over the action of joint venture particularly when we own minority interest result we may be unable to prevent violation of applicable law or other misconduct by joint venture or the failure to satisfy contractual obligation by one or more party moreover joint venture may not follow the same requirement regarding compliance internal control and internal control over financial reporting that we follow to the extent another party make decision that negatively impact the joint venture or internal control issue arise within the joint venture we may have to take responsive action or we may be subject to penalty fine or other punitive action for these activity of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthe international scale and footprint of our operation expose to additional risk we manufacture sell and service product globally and rely upon an integrated global supply chain to deliver the raw material component system and part that we need to manufacture our product our global operation subject to extensive domestic and foreign legal and regulatory requirement and variety of other political economic and regulatory risk including change in government leadership change in labor employment tax privacy environmental and other law regulation or government policy impacting our overall business model or practice or restricting our ability to manufacture purchase or sell product consistent with market demand and our business objective political pressure to change any aspect of our business model or practice or that impair our ability to source raw material service component system and part or manufacture product on competitive term in manner consistent with our business objective political instability civil unrest or government control over certain sector political and economic tension between government and change in international trade policy including restriction on the repatriation of dividend or in the export of technology especially between china and the more detailed inspection or new or higher tariff for example on product imported into or exported from

financing in foreign country for local operation and natural disaster public health crisis including the occurrence of contagious disease or illness such covid see the covid pandemic may disrupt our business and operation which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation in this item risk factor and other catastrophic event any significant disruption at one of our manufacturing facility could disrupt our production schedule we assemble vehicle at various facility around the world our facility are typically designed to produce particular model for particular geographic market no single facility is designed to manufacture our full range of vehicle in some case certain facility produce product system component and part that disproportionately contribute greater degree to our profitability than others and create significant interdependency among manufacturing facility around the world should these or other facility become unavailable either temporarily or permanently for any number of reason including labor disruption the occurrence of contagious disease or illness such covid see the covid pandemic may disrupt our business and operation which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation in this item risk factor or catastrophic weather event the inability to manufacture at the affected facility may result in harm to our reputation increased cost lower revenue and the loss of customer in particular substantially all of our hourly employee are represented by union and covered by collective bargaining agreement that must be negotiated from time to time often at the local facility level which increase our risk of work stoppage we may not be able to easily shift production to other facility or to make up for lost production any new facility needed to replace an inoperable manufacturing facility would need to comply with the necessary regulatory requirement need to satisfy our specialized manufacturing requirement and require specialized equipment any disruption in our supplier operation could disrupt our production schedule our automotive operation are dependent upon the continued ability of our supplier to deliver the system component raw material and part that we need to manufacture our product our use of in time manufacturing process allows to maintain minimal inventory result our ability to maintain production is dependent upon our supplier delivering sufficient quantity of system component raw material and part on time to meet our production schedule in some instance we purchase system component raw material and part that are ultimately derived from single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruption any number of factor including labor disruption catastrophic weather event the occurrence of contagious disease or illness such covid see the covid pandemic may disrupt our business and operation which could materially adversely impact our business financial condition liquidity and result of operation in this item risk factor contractual or other dispute unfavorable economic or industry condition delivery delay or other performance problem or financial difficulty or solvency problem could disrupt our supplier operation and lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruption for which could in turn disrupt our operation including the production of certain higher margin vehicle if the covid pandemic continues to spread or re emerges and result in prolonged period of travel commercial social and other similar restriction we could experience continued and or additional global supply disruption if we experience supply disruption we may not be able to develop alternate sourcing quickly any disruption of our production schedule caused by an unexpected shortage of system component raw material or part even for relatively short period of time could cause to alter production schedule or suspend production entirely which could cause loss of revenue which would adversely affect our operation of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesin particular global semiconductor supply shortage is having wide ranging effect across multiple industry particularly the automotive industry and it ha impacted multiple supplier that incorporate semiconductor into the part they supply to result the semiconductor supply shortage ha had and will continue to have an impact on our vehicle production and we anticipate it will have material impact on our performance in high price of raw material or other input used by and our supplier could negatively impact our profitability increase in price for raw material or other input that we and our supplier use in manufacturing product system component and part such steel precious metal non ferrous metal critical mineral or other similar raw material may lead to higher production cost for part component and vehicle change in trade policy and tariff fluctuation in supply and demand and other economic and political factor may continue to create pricing pressure for raw material and other input this could in turn negatively impact our future profitability because we may not be able to pas all of those cost on to our customer or require our supplier to absorb such cost we may continue to restructure our operation in the and various other country and initiate additional cost reduction action but we may not succeed in doing since we have undertaken restructuring action to lower our operating cost in response to difficult market and operating condition in various part of the world including the canada korea southeast asia india australia and new zealand and europe we continue to ass our performance throughout our region we may take additional restructuring action to rationalize our operation which may result in material asset write down or impairment and reduce our profitability in the period incurred in addition we are continuing to implement number of operating effectiveness initiative to improve productivity and reduce cost in addition these restructuring action subject to increased risk of labor unrest or strike supplier dealer or other third party litigation regulator claim or proceeding negative publicity and business disruption failure to realize anticipated saving or benefit from our restructuring and or cost reduction action could have material adverse effect on our business liquidity and cash flow risk related to our intellectual property cybersecurity information technology and data management practicescompetitors may independently develop product and service similar to and there are no guarantee that gm intellectual property right would prevent competitor from independently developing or selling those product and service there may be instance where notwithstanding our intellectual property position competitive product or service may impact the value of our brand and other intangible asset and our business may be adversely affected moreover although gm take reasonable step to maintain the confidentiality of gm proprietary information there can be no assurance that such effort will completely deter or prevent misappropriation or improper use of our technology we sometimes face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology network and system for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position in addition we may be the target of patent enforcement action by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming although we have taken step to mitigate such risk if we are found to have infringed any third party intellectual property right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service security breach and other disruption to information technology system and networked product including connected vehicle owned or maintained by gm financial or third party vendor or supplier on our behalf could interfere with our operation and could compromise the confidentiality of private customer data or our proprietary information we rely upon information technology system and manufacture networked product some of which are managed by third party to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of our business process activity and product additionally we and gm financial collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property and proprietary business information including that of our dealer and supplier well personally identifiable information of our customer and employee in data center and on information technology network including network that may be controlled or maintained by third party the secure operation of these system and product and the processing and maintenance of the information processed by these system and product is critical to our business operation and strategy further customer using our system rely on the security of our infrastructure including hardware and other element provided by third party to ensure the reliability of our product and the protection of their data despite security measure and business continuity plan these system and product may be vulnerable to damage disruption or shutdown caused by attack by hacker computer virus malware including ransomware phishing attack or breach due to error or malfeasance by employee contractor and others who have access to these system and product the occurrence of any of these event could compromise the confidentiality operational integrity and accessibility of these system and product and the data that resides within similarly such an occurrence could result in the compromise or loss of the information processed by these system and product such event could result in among other thing the loss of proprietary data interruption or delay in our business operation and damage to our reputation in addition such event could increase the risk of claim alleging that we are non of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariescompliant with applicable law or regulation subjecting to potential liability or regulatory penalty and related cost under law protecting the privacy of personal information disrupt our operation or reduce the competitive advantage we hope to derive from our investment in advanced technology we have experienced such event in the past and although past event were immaterial future event may occur and may be material security breach and other disruption of our in vehicle system could impact the safety of our customer and reduce confidence in gm and our product our vehicle contain complex information technology system these system control various vehicle function including engine transmission safety steering navigation acceleration braking window and door lock function we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to these system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such system to gain control of or to change our vehicle functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle any unauthorized access to or control of our vehicle or their system could adversely impact the safety of our customer or result in legal claim or proceeding liability or regulatory penalty new law such the new data law in massachusetts that would permit third party access to vehicle data and related system could expose our vehicle and vehicle system to third party access without appropriate security measure in place leading to new safety and security risk for our customer and reducing customer trust and confidence in our product in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our vehicle or their system could negatively affect our brand and harm our reputation which could impact our business and operating result our enterprise data practice including the collection use sharing and security of the personal identifiable information of our customer employee and supplier are subject to increasingly complex restrictive and punitive regulation in all key market region under these regulation the failure to maintain compliant data practice could result in consumer complaint and regulatory inquiry resulting in civil or criminal penalty well brand impact or other harm to our business in addition increased consumer sensitivity to real or perceived failure in maintaining acceptable data practice could damage our reputation and deter current and potential user or customer from using our product and service because many of these law are new there is little clarity to their interpretation well lack of precedent for the scope of enforcement the cost of compliance with these law and regulation will be high and is likely to increase in the future for example the california consumer protection act became effective in obligating company to quickly respond to consumer request to delete disclose and stop selling personal information of california resident with significant fine for noncompliance other state are considering similar law with some considering private right of action for consumer that would allow consumer to bring claim directly against gm for mishandling their data in europe in the court of justice for the eu invalidated mechanism for transferring personal information out of the eu leading to wave of potential new barrier for data sharing between the eu and among other country the in canada both the federal government and certain province have also proposed new legislation imposing significant and unprecedented obligation fine and liability regarding data handling overcoming these new barrier is likely to increase our cost and drive new complexity in our operation risk related to government regulation and litigationour operation and product are subject to extensive law regulation and policy including those related to vehicle emission fuel economy standard and greenhouse gas emission that can significantly increase our cost and affect how we do business we are significantly affected by governmental regulation on global basis that can increase cost related to the production of our vehicle and affect our product portfolio particularly regulation relating to emission fuel economy standard and greenhouse gas emission meeting or exceeding many of these regulation is costly and often technologically challenging especially because the standard are not harmonized across jurisdiction we anticipate that the number and extent of these and other regulation law and policy and the related cost and change to our product portfolio may increase significantly in the future primarily out of concern for the environment including concern about global climate change and it impact these government regulatory requirement among others could significantly affect our plan for global product development and given the uncertainty surrounding enforcement and regulatory definition and interpretation may result in substantial cost including civil or criminal penalty in addition an evolving but un harmonized emission and fuel economy regulatory framework may limit or dictate the type of vehicle we sell and where we sell them which can affect our revenue refer to the environmental and regulatory matter section of item business for further information on regulatory and environmental requirement we expect that to comply with fuel economy and emission control requirement we will be required to sell significant volume of electric vehicle and potentially develop and implement new technology for conventional internal combustion engine all at increased cost there are limit on our ability to achieve fuel economy improvement over given time frame primarily relating to the cost and effectiveness of available technology lack of sufficient consumer acceptance of new technology and of change in vehicle mix lack of willingness of consumer to absorb the additional cost of new technology the appropriateness or lack thereof of certain technology for use in particular vehicle the widespread availability or lack thereof of supporting infrastructure for new technology and the human engineering and financial resource necessary to deploy new technology across wide range of product and powertrains in short time there is no of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesassurance that we will be able to produce and sell vehicle that use such new technology on profitable basis or that our customer will purchase such vehicle in the quantity necessary for to comply with these regulatory program in the current uncertain regulatory framework environmental liability for which we may be responsible and that are not reasonably estimable could be substantial alleged violation of safety fuel economy or emission standard could result in legal proceeding the recall of one or more of our product negotiated remedial action fine restricted product offering or combination of any of those item any of these action could have material adverse effect on our operation including facility idling reduced employment increased cost and loss of revenue in addition many of our advanced technology including autonomous vehicle present novel issue with which domestic and foreign regulator have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory framework any current or future regulation in these area could impact whether and how these technology are designed and integrated into our product and may ultimately subject to increased cost and uncertainty we could be materially adversely affected by unusual or significant litigation governmental investigation or other proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding involving various issue including product liability lawsuit class action litigation alleging product defect emission litigation both in the and elsewhere stockholder litigation labor and employment litigation in various country including canada korea and brazil claim and action arising from restructurings divestiture of operation and asset and proceeding related to the ignition switch recall in addition we are subject to governmental proceeding and investigation negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceeding could result in the imposition of damage including punitive damage substantial fine significant reputational harm civil lawsuit and criminal penalty interruption of business modification of business practice equitable remedy and other sanction against or our personnel well significant legal and other cost for further discussion of these matter refer to note to our consolidated financial statement the cost and effect on our reputation of product safety recall and alleged defect in product and service could materially adversely affect our business government safety standard require manufacturer to remedy certain product safety defect through recall campaign and vehicle repurchase under these standard we could be subject to civil or criminal penalty or may incur various cost including significant cost for repair made at no cost to the consumer at present the cost we incur in connection with these recall typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part the cost to complete recall could be exacerbated to the extent that such action relates to global platform concern about the safety of our product including advanced technology like autonomous vehicle whether raised internally or by regulator or consumer advocate and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data can result in product delay recall lost sale governmental investigation regulatory action private claim lawsuit and settlement and reputational damage these circumstance can also result in damage to brand image brand equity and consumer trust in our product and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry we currently source variety of system component raw material and part from third party from time to time these item may have performance or quality issue that could harm our reputation and cause to incur significant cost particularly if the affected item relate to global platform or involve defect that are identified year after production our ability to recover cost associated with recall or other campaign caused by part or component purchased from supplier may be limited by the supplier financial condition or number of other reason or defense we may incur additional tax expense or become subject to additional tax exposure we are subject to the tax law and regulation of the and numerous other jurisdiction in which we do business many judgment are required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability and we are regularly under audit by the internal revenue service and other tax authority which may not agree with our tax position in addition our tax liability are subject to other significant risk and uncertainty including those arising from potential change in law and regulation in the country in which we do business the possibility of adverse determination with respect to the application of existing law change in our business or structure and change in the valuation of our deferred tax asset and liability any unfavorable resolution of these and other uncertainty may have significant adverse impact on our tax rate and result of operation if our tax expense were to increase or if the ultimate determination of our tax owed is for an amount in excess of amount previously accrued our operating result cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected risk related to automotive financing gm financial we rely on gm financial to provide financial service to our customer and dealer globally gm financial face number of business economic and financial risk that could impair it access to capital and negatively affect it business and operation which in turn could impede it ability to provide leasing and financing to customer and commercial lending to our dealer any reduction in gm financial ability to provide such financial service would negatively affect our effort to support additional sale of our vehicle and expand our market penetration among customer and dealer of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthe primary factor that could adversely affect gm financial business and operation and reduce it ability to provide financing service at competitive rate include the sufficiency availability and cost of source of financing including credit facility securitization program and secured and unsecured debt issuance the performance of loan and lease in it portfolio which could be materially affected by charge offs delinquency and prepayment wholesale auction value of used vehicle vehicle return rate and the residual value performance on vehicle gm financial lease to customer fluctuation in interest rate and currency competition for customer from commercial bank credit union and other financing and leasing company and change to regulation supervision enforcement and licensing across various jurisdiction in addition substantial portion of gm financial indebtedness bear interest at variable interest rate primarily based on usd libor the financial conduct authority which regulates libor ha announced that it will no longer persuade or compel bank to submit rate for the calculation of libor after it is unknown whether any bank will continue to voluntarily submit rate for the calculation of libor or whether libor will continue to be published by it administrator based on these submission or on any other basis after at this time it is not possible to predict the effect that these development or any discontinuance modification or other reform may have on libor other benchmark or floating rate debt instrument including gm financial floating rate debt any such discontinuance modification alternative reference rate or other reform may materially adversely affect interest rate on gm financial current or future indebtedness there is risk that the discontinuation of libor will impact gm financial ability to manage interest rate risk effectively without an adequate replacement further an entity operating in the financial service sector gm financial is required to comply with wide variety of law and regulation that may be costly to adhere to and may affect our consolidated operating result compliance with these law and regulation requires that gm financial maintain form process procedure control and the infrastructure to support these requirement and these law and regulation often create operational constraint both on gm financial ability to implement servicing procedure and on pricing law in the financial service industry are designed primarily for the protection of consumer the failure to comply with these law could result in significant statutory civil and criminal penalty monetary damage attorney fee and cost possible revocation of license and damage to reputation brand and valued customer relationship risk related to defined benefit pension plansour defined benefit pension plan are currently underfunded and our pension funding requirement could increase significantly due to reduction in funded status result of variety of factor including weak performance of financial market declining interest rate change in law or regulation or change in assumption or investment that do

funding requirement are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statement which also describes significant concentration of risk to the plan investment our future funding requirement for our defined benefit pension plan depend upon the future performance of asset placed in trust for these plan the level of interest rate used to determine funding level the level of benefit provided for by the plan and any change in law and regulation future funding requirement generally increase if the discount rate decrease or if actual asset return are lower than expected asset return assuming other factor are held constant we estimate future contribution to these plan using assumption with respect to these and other item change to those assumption could have significant effect on future contribution there are additional risk due to the complexity and magnitude of our investment example include implementation of significant change in investment policy insufficient market liquidity in particular asset class and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long term investment factor that affect future funding requirement for our defined benefit plan generally affect the required

sensitive to the estimated number of recall event the number of vehicle per recall event the assumed number of vehicle that will be brought in by customer for repair take rate and the cost per vehicle for each recall event the estimated cost of recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaign would increase the estimated cost by approximately billion actual experience could differ from the amount estimated requiring adjustment to these liability in future period due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factor contributing to developing estimate change in our assumption could materially affect our result of operation sale incentive the estimated effect of sale incentive offered to dealer and end customer is recorded reduction of automotive net sale and revenue at the time of sale there may be numerous type of incentive available at any particular time incentive program are generally specific to brand model or sale region and are for specified time period which may be extended significant factor used in estimating the cost of incentive include type of program forecasted sale volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive program all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning future customer behavior and market condition change in any of these factor affecting the estimate could have significant effect on recorded sale incentive increase in the cost of incentive would increase the sale incentive liability by approximately billion subsequent adjustment to incentive estimate are possible fact and circumstance change over time which could affect the revenue previously recognized in automotive net sale and revenue gm financial allowance for loan loss the gm financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller balance homogeneous loan that are carried at amortized cost net of allowance for loan loss the allowance for loan loss on retail finance receivables reflects net credit loss expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables which have weighted average remaining life of approximately two year we forecast net credit loss based on relevant information about past event current condition and forecast economic performance we believe that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit loss on the retail finance receivables however because the allowance for loan loss is based on estimate there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimate or that our credit loss assumption will not increase gm financial incorporates assumption about forecast charge off recovery rate and overall economic performance in it allowance estimate used vehicle price rebounded in the second half of after decreasing in march and april and recovery outperformed the forecast therefore gm financial increased it recovery rate forecast of december each relative decrease increase in the forecast recovery rate could increase decrease our allowance for loan loss by approximately billion gm financial updated it forecast of economic performance in march following the onset of the covid pandemic and ha continued to monitor and update the forecast through december at december the weighting applied to the economic forecast scenario considered resulted in an allowance for loan loss on the retail finance receivables portfolio of billion using different possible weighting that gm financial could apply to the economic forecast scenario of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesresult in an allowance for loan loss ranging from billion to billion actual economic data and recovery rate that are lower than those forecasted by gm financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan loss the gm financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing well dealer loan which are loan to finance improvement to dealership facility to provide working capital and to purchase and or finance dealership real estate the allowance for loan loss on commercial finance receivables is also based on estimate that effective january include historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio well the forecast for industry vehicle sale there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge off amount will not exceed such estimate or that gm financial credit loss assumption will not increase valuation of gm financial equipment on operating lease asset and residual gm financial ha investment in leased vehicle recorded operating lease which relate to vehicle lease to retail customer with lease term that typically range from two to five year at lease inception an estimate is made of the expected residual value at the end of the lease term the expected residual value is based on third party data that considers various data point and assumption including but not limited to recent auction value the expected future volume of returning leased vehicle used vehicle price manufacturer incentive program and fuel price realization of the residual value is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicle under prevailing market condition the customer is obligated to make payment during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus money factor however since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract gm financial is exposed to risk of loss to the extent the customer return the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception the following table summarizes vehicle included in gm financial equipment on operating lease net vehicle in thousand december at december the estimated residual value of gm financial leased vehicle wa billion depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in gm financial operating lease portfolio over time from it original acquisition value to it expected residual value at the end of the lease term gm financial updated the residual value estimate on the operating lease portfolio to reflect the decrease in forecasted used vehicle price in march following the onset of the covid pandemic and ha continued to monitor and update the residual value estimate through december used vehicle price rebounded in the second half of after decreasing in march and april and sale proceeds on terminated leased vehicle outperformed the residual value estimate during the year ended december accordingly gm financial increased the residual value estimate at december which will result in prospective decrease in the depreciation rate over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio if used vehicle price decrease gm financial would increase depreciation expense and or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio if an impairment exists gm financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset group by year make and model recoverability is calculated the excess of the sum of remaining lease payment plus estimated residual value over leased vehicle net le deferred revenue alternatively if used vehicle price outperform gm financial latest estimate it may record gain on sale of off lease vehicle and or decreased depreciation expense of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthe following table illustrates the effect of relative change in the estimated residual value at december which could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio holding all other assumption constant dollar in million impact to depreciation and total change to residual value are rarely simultaneous across all maturity and segment and also may impact return rate if decrease in residual value is concentrated among specific asset group the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge gm financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicator of impairment and determined that no impairment indicator were present at december and used vehicle price increased approximately in compared to primarily due to low new vehicle inventory largely driven by the suspension of manufacturing operation result of the covid pandemic creating strong demand for used vehicle in gm financial expects used vehicle price to decline by an amount in the low single digit on percentage basis compared to level supply and demand dynamic normalize pension and opeb plan our defined benefit pension plan are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including an expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement our pension obligation include korean statutory pension payment that are valued on walk away basis the expected long term rate of return on plan asset that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic study which include review of asset allocation strategy anticipated future long term performance of individual asset class risk using standard deviation and correlation of return among the asset class that comprise the plan asset mix while the study give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical return the assumption are primarily long term prospective rate of return in december an investment policy study wa completed for the pension plan result of change to our capital market assumption the weighted average long term rate of return on asset decreased from at december to at december the expected long term rate of return on plan asset used in determining pension expense for non plan is determined in similar manner to the plan another key assumption in determining net pension and opeb expense is the assumed discount rate used to discount plan obligation we estimate the assumed discount rate for plan using cash flow matching approach which us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flow we apply the individual annual yield curve rate instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost which more specifically link the cash flow related to service cost and interest cost to bond maturing in their year of payment the society of actuary soa issued mortality improvement table in the three month ended december we incorporated these soa mortality improvement table into our december measurement of pension and opeb plan benefit obligation the change in these assumption decreased the december pension and opeb plan obligation by billion significant difference in actual experience or significant change in assumption may materially affect the pension obligation the effect of actual result differing from assumption and the changing of assumption are included in unamortized net actuarial gain and loss that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future period the unamortized pre tax actuarial loss on our pension plan wa billion and billion at december and the year over year change is primarily due to decrease in discount rate partially offset by higher than expected asset return of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthe underfunded status of the pension plan remained unchanged in the year ended december at billion primarily due to the unfavorable effect of decrease in discount rate of billion and service and interest cost of billion partially offset by favorable effect of actual return on plan asset of billion and change in

procedure approved by the financial risk council our financial risk management policy is designed to protect against risk arising from extreme adverse market movement on our key exposure automotive the following analysis provide quantitative information regarding exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk interest rate risk and equity price risk sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk the model used assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate and interest rate yield curve for option and other instrument with nonlinear return model appropriate to these type of instrument are utilized to determine the effect of market shift there are certain shortcoming inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that interest rate change in parallel fashion and that spot exchange rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled and do not contemplate the effect of correlation between foreign currency exposure and offsetting long short position in currency or other exposure such interest rate which may significantly reduce the potential loss in value foreign currency exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to buying selling and financing in currency other than the functional currency of our operation at december our most significant foreign currency exposure were between the dollar and the canadian dollar korean euro chinese yuan brazilian real and mexican peso derivative instrument such foreign currency forward swap and option are primarily used to hedge of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesexposures with respect to forecasted revenue cost and commitment denominated in foreign currency such contract had remaining maturity of up to month at december the net fair value liability of financial instrument with exposure to foreign currency risk wa billion and billion at december and these amount are calculated utilizing population of foreign currency exchange derivative and foreign currency denominated debt and exclude the offsetting effect of foreign currency cash cash equivalent and other asset the potential loss in fair value for such financial instrument from adverse change in all quoted foreign currency exchange rate would have been billion and billion at december and we are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the result of certain international operation into dollar part of the consolidation process we had foreign currency derivative with notional amount of billion and billion at december and the fair value of these derivative financial instrument wa insignificant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can therefore create volatility in the result of operation and may adversely affect our financial condition the following table summarizes the amount of automotive foreign currency translation and transaction and remeasurement gain loss year ended december loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss transaction and remeasurement gain loss recorded in earnings interest rate risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to change in interest rate related to certain financial instrument primarily debt finance lease obligation and certain marketable debt security we did not have any interest rate swap position to manage interest rate exposure in our automotive operation at december and the fair value of debt and finance lease wa billion and billion at december and the potential increase in fair value resulting from decrease in quoted interest rate would have been billion and billion at december and we had marketable debt security of billion and billion classified available for sale at december and the potential decrease in fair value from basis point increase in interest rate would have had an insignificant effect at december and equity price risk we are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in psa warrant the fair value of investment with exposure to equity price risk wa billion and billion at december and our investment in psa warrant is valued based on black scholes formula we estimate that adverse change in quoted security price in psa group would impact our investment by billion at december and automotive financing gm financialinterest rate risk fluctuation in market interest rate can affect gm financial gross interest rate spread which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt gm financial is exposed to interest rate risk financial asset and liability have different characteristic that may impact financial performance these difference may include tenor yield re pricing timing and prepayment expectation typically retail finance receivables and lease purchased by gm financial earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by gm financial earn variable interest gm financial fund it business with variable or fixed rate debt the variable rate debt is subject to adjustment to reflect prevailing market interest rate to help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding gm financial may employ hedging quantitative disclosure gm financial measure the sensitivity of it net interest income to change in interest rate by using interest rate scenario that assume hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis point in all interest rate across all maturity well base case that assumes that rate perform at the current market forward curve however interest rate change are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rate could move more or le than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis therefore the actual impact to net interest income could be higher or lower than the result detailed in of contentsgeneral motor company and subsidiariesthe table below these interest rate scenario are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movement at december gm financial wa asset sensitive meaning that more asset than liability were expected to re price within the next twelve month during period of rising interest rate the interest earned on asset would increase more than the interest paid on liability which would initially increase net interest income during period of falling interest rate net interest income would be expected to initially decrease at december gm financial wa liability sensitive meaning that more liability than asset were expected to re price within the next twelve month during period of rising interest rate the interest paid on liability would increase more than the interest earned on asset which would initially decrease net interest income during period of falling interest rate net interest income would be expected to initially increase gm financial net interest income sensitivity increased in compared to primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive asset exposure relative to rate sensitive liability exposure gm financial hedging strategy approved by it global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guideline the following table present gm financial net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement year ended december hundred basis point instantaneous increase in interest rate one hundred basis point instantaneous decrease in interest rate __________ net interest income sensitivity given one hundred basis point decrease in interest rate requires an assumption of negative interest rate in market where existing interest rate are below one percent additional model assumption the sensitivity analysis presented is gm financial best estimate of the effect of the hypothetical interest rate scenario however actual result could differ the estimate are also based on assumption including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio origination of finance receivables and lease refinancing of maturing debt replacement of maturing derivative and exercise of option embedded in debt and derivative the prepayment projection are based on historical experience if interest rate or other factor change actual prepayment experience could be different than projected foreign currency exchange rate risk gm financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the result of certain international operation into dollar part of the consolidation process fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate can therefore create volatility in the result of operation and may adversely affect gm financial financial condition gm financial primarily finance it receivables and leased asset with debt in the same currency when different currency is used gm financial may use foreign currency swap to convert substantially all of it foreign currency debt obligation to the local currency of the receivables and leased asset to minimize any impact to earnings result gm financial belief it market risk exposure relating to change in currency exchange rate at december wa insignificant gm financial had foreign currency swap with notional amount of billion and billion at december and the net fair value of these derivative financial instrument wa an asset of billion and an insignificant amount at december and the following table summarizes gm financial foreign currency

accrues for cost related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaign when they are probable and estimable which is generally at the time of sale auditing these liability involved high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management estimate due to the size uncertainty and potential volatility related to the estimated liability management estimate consider historical claim experience including the nature frequency and average cost of claim of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and the key assumption of historical data being predictive of future activity and event in particular the number of historical period used and the weighing of historical data in the reserve study of contentshow we addressed the matter in

involved high degree of judgment significant factor used by the company in estimating it liability for retail incentive include type of program forecasted sale volume product mix and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive program all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumption concerning future customer behavior and market condition the company estimation model reflects the best estimate of the total incentive amount that the company reasonably expects to pay at the time of sale the estimated cost of incentive is forward looking and could be materially affected by future economic and market condition how we addressed the matter in our auditwe evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal control over the company sale incentive process including management review of the estimation model the significant assumption incentive cost per unit customer take rate and market condition and the data input used in the model our audit procedure included among others the performance of analytical procedure to develop an independent range of the liability for retail incentive of the balance sheet date our independent range wa developed for comparison to the company recorded liability and is based on historical claim forecasted spend and the specific vehicle mix of current dealer stock in addition we performed sensitivity analysis over the cost per unit assumption developed by management to evaluate the impact on the liability resulting from change in the assumption lastly we assessed management forecasting process by performing quarterly hindsight analysis to ass the adequacy of prior forecast valuation of gm financial equipment on operating leasesdescription of the mattergm financial ha recorded

the difference between the fair value of asset and the expected calculated value in the first year and of that difference over each of the next four year the discount rate assumption is established for each of the retirement related benefit plan at their respective measurement date in the we use cash flow matching approach that us projected cash flow matched to spot rate along high quality
