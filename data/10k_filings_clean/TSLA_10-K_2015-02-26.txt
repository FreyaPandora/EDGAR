daimler for it smart fortwo class and class electric vehicle and to toyota for use in it ev we are continuing to supply production part for the daimler class electric vehicle technology we believe the core competency of our company are powertrain engineering vehicle engineering and innovative manufacturing our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain and the ability to design vehicle which capitalizes on the uniqueness of an electric powertrain our electric powertrain consists of the following battery pack power electronics motor gearbox and the control software which enables the component to operate system we designed each of these major element for our tesla roadster and model and plan to use much of this technology in model model our future electric vehicle and powertrain component that we build for other manufacturer our powertrain and battery pack have modular design enabling future generation of electric vehicle and our stationary storage application to incorporate significant amount of this technology further our powertrain is compact and contains far fewer moving part than the internal combustion powertrain these feature enable to adapt it for variety of application including our future vehicle and any powertrain component we build for other manufacturer battery pack we design our battery pack to achieve high energy density at low cost while also maintaining safety reliability and long life for example we have designed our model battery pack to store kilowatt hour of useful energy and offer warranty of unlimited mile over eight year our proprietary technology includes cooling system safety system charge balancing system battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability robotic manufacturing process customized motor design and the software and electronics management system necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real life driving condition we have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management system needed to work with lithium ion cell in the demanding automotive environment we believe these advancement have enabled to produce battery pack at low cost per kilowatt hour we have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry form factor and vendor in we believe that we can leverage the substantial battery cell investment and advancement being made globally by battery cell manufacturer and to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt hour of our battery pack we maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium ion cell vendor and chemistry type we intend to incorporate the battery cell that provide the best value and performance possible our battery pack and we expect this to continue over time battery cell continue to improve in energy storage capacity longevity power delivery and cost we believe this flexibility will enable to continue to evaluate new battery cell become commercially viable and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicle in addition we are designing the cell manufacturing equipment for the tesla gigafactory to enable flexibility in term of battery chemistry and form factor we believe our ability to change battery cell chemistry and vendor while retaining our existing investment in software electronics manufacturing equipment testing and vehicle packaging will enable to quickly deploy various battery cell into our product and leverage the latest advancement in battery cell technology the range of our electric vehicle on single charge decline principally function of usage time and charging pattern customer use of tesla vehicle well the frequency with which they charge the battery of their tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery ability to hold charge for example we currently expect that the tesla roadster battery pack will retain approximately of it ability to hold it initial charge after approximately mile or seven year which will result in decrease to the vehicle initial range in comparison with the roadster battery pack preliminary internal testing and customer result of model to date suggest that the retention rate of the model battery pack is greater due to improvement at the battery cell and pack level in addition based on internal testing we estimate that the model would have an approximate reduction in range when operated continuously in temperature to date we have tested hundred of battery cell of different chemistry form factor and design based on this evaluation we are presently using lithium ion battery cell based on the form factor in all of our battery pack we intend to use the battery cell form factor in model and entered into supply agreement with panasonic corporation panasonic for the use of panasonic battery cell in model and model we expect these battery cell to exhibit better performance and longer lifetime than the battery cell used in the tesla roadster power electronics the power electronics in our electric powertrain govern the flow of electrical current throughout the car primarily the current that flow into and out of the battery pack the power electronics have two primary function the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging the first function is accomplished through the drive inverter which convert direct current dc from the battery pack into alternating current ac to drive our three phase induction motor the drive inverter also convert the ac generated by regenerative braking back into dc for electrical storage in the battery pack the drive inverter performs this function by using high performance digital signal processor which run of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle in so doing the drive inverter is directly responsible for the performance high efficiency and overall driving experience of the vehicle the second function charging the battery pack is accomplished by the charger which convert alternating current usually from wall outlet or other electricity source into direct current that can be accepted by the battery tesla vehicle can recharge on variety of ac electrical source from common outlet to high power circuit of up to which provides faster recharging vehicle in both the united state and europe come with the tesla mobile connector which enables charging from variety of different outlet in other market tesla offer tesla wall connector that can be hardwired at wide range of power level to suit the electrical capability of the charging location the most common home charging system us standard high power and mobile connector to charge overnight on the road customer can also charge using our supercharger network or at variety of destination that have deployed our charging equipment in addition model vehicle can also charge at variety of public charging station around the world either natively or through suite of adapter this flexibility in charging provides customer with additional mobility while also allowing to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home vehicle control and infotainment software the performance and safety system of our vehicle and their battery pack require sophisticated control software there are numerous processor in our vehicle to control these function and we write custom firmware for many of these processor the flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle for example software algorithm enable the vehicle to mimic the creep feeling which driver expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator similar algorithm control traction vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cell of the battery pack and to manage all of it safety system driver use the information and control system in our vehicle to optimize performance customize vehicle behavior manage charging mode and time and control all infotainment function we develop almost all of this software including most of the user interface internally we are also developing expertise in vehicle autopilot system including road tracking lane changing automated parking driver warning system and automated braking function vehicle design and engineering in addition to the design development and production of the powertrain we have created significant in house capability in the design and engineering of electric vehicle and electric vehicle component and system we design and engineer body chassis interior heating and cooling and low voltage electrical system in house and to lesser extent in conjunction with our supplier our team ha core competency in computer aided design and crash test simulation which we expect to reduce the product development time of new model several traditional automotive subsystem required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle for example we redesigned the heating ventilation and air conditioning hvac system to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine we have developed expertise in integrating these component with the high voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing component that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle additionally our team ha expertise in lightweight material very important characteristic for electric vehicle given the impact of mass on range model is built with lightweight aluminum body and chassis which incorporates variety of material and production method that help optimize the weight of the vehicle sale and marketing company owned store and gallery we market and sell car directly to consumer through an international network of company owned store and gallery our tesla store and gallery are highly visible premium outlet in major metropolitan market some of which combine retail sale and service we have also found that opening service center in new geographic area can increase demand result we have complemented our store strategy with sale facility and personnel in service center to more rapidly expand our retail footprint we refer to these service plus location including all of our sale service plus and service facility we operated location around the world of december we believe that by owning our own sale and service network we can offer compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiency and capturing sale and service revenue incumbent automobile manufacturer do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model our customer deal directly with our own tesla employed sale and service staff creating we believe is differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumer have with franchised automobile dealer and service center we believe we will also be able to better control cost of inventory manage warranty service and pricing maintain and strengthen the tesla brand and obtain rapid customer feedback further we believe that by owning our sale network we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturer where the sale of warranty part and repair by dealer are key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer tesla supercharger network we are building network of up to kw fast charging equipment each called tesla supercharger throughout north america europe and asia for fast charging of model and future tesla vehicle our supercharger network is strategic corporate initiative designed to remove barrier to the broader adoption of electric vehicle caused by the perception of limited vehicle range and to provide free charging access to tesla existing customer the tesla supercharger is an industrial grade high speed

december and ending in december the equipment purchase were used for three purpose to establish our production facility for model in california ii to upgrade our palo alto powertrain production facility and iii to expand our tesla roadster assembly operation at our menlo park facility we exhausted all fund from the december approved exemption from california state sale and use tax for million of manufacturing equipment in december in january we finalized an additional agreement with caeatfa for an exclusion from california state sale and use tax for the purchase of up to million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sale or use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax saving by of up to approximately million over the period starting in december and ending in december the equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for two purpose to develop model and it production capacity in california and ii to further upgrade our powertrain production facility in california we have not yet exhausted the million in fund approved by caeatfa in in december we finalized third agreement with caeatfa that will result in an exclusion from california state sale and use tax for an additional million of manufacturing equipment to the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to california state sale or use tax we believe this incentive would result in tax saving by of up to approximately million over the period starting in december and ending in december the equipment purchased under this exclusion may only be used for three purpose to expand model manufacturing capacity in california ii to expand electric vehicle powertrain production in california and iii future model electric vehicle development regulatory credit in connection with the production delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicle in global market we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable regulatory credit that can be sold to other manufacturer under california zero emission vehicle regulation and those of state that have adopted the california standard vehicle manufacturer are required to ensure that portion of the vehicle delivered for sale in those state during each model year are zero emission vehicle and partial zero emission vehicle currently the state of arizona california connecticut maine maryland massachusetts new jersey new mexico new york oregon rhode island and vermont have such law in effect these law provide that manufacturer may earn credit referred to zev credit if they produce more zero emission vehicle than the minimum quantity required by those law those manufacturer with surplus of credit may sell the excess credit to other manufacturer who can apply such credit to comply with the regulatory requirement including making up for deficit manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicle we have no minimum requirement and therefore earn zev credit on each vehicle delivered and placed into service in such state we have entered into agreement with other automobile manufacturer to sell the zev credit that we earn recently california passed amendment to the zev mandate that would require starting in all large volume manufacturer those manufacturer selling or more vehicle in california in to increase the number of zero emission vehicle sold such that of each manufacturer fleet must be made of zero emission vehicle by all state that have adopted the california program will amend their program to conform to the new california standard additionally under the environmental protection agency epa national greenhouse gas ghg emission standard and similar standard adopted by the canadian government car and truck manufacturer are required to meet fleet wide average carbon dioxide emission standard manufacturer who fail to meet such standard have deficit in their emission profile manufacturer whose fleet wide average performs better than such standard may earn credit manufacturer may sell excess credit to other manufacturer who can use the credit to comply with these regulatory requirement manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicle we earn the full amount of ghg credit established by the standard on each vehicle sold we have contracted with another automobile manufacturer to sell all earned credit under the national highway traffic safety administration nhtsa corporate average fuel economy cafe standard car and truck manufacturer are required to meet fleet wide average fuel economy standard manufacturer that fail to meet such standard have deficit in their fuel economy profile manufacturer whose fleet wide average performs better than such standard may earn credit manufacturer may sell excess credit to other manufacturer who can use such credit to comply with these regulatory requirement we have entered into agreement to sell the credit that we earn regulation vehicle safety and testing our vehicle are subject to and comply with or are otherwise exempt from numerous regulatory requirement established by nhtsa including all applicable united state federal motor vehicle safety standard fmvss the model fully complies with all fmvsss without the need for any exemption the roadster complies with or is exempt from all fmvss manufacturer we must self certify that our vehicle meet all applicable fmvss well the nhtsa bumper standard or otherwise are exempt before the vehicle can be imported or sold in the united state numerous fmvss apply to our vehicle such crash worthiness requirement crash avoidance requirement and electric vehicle requirement we are also required to comply with other federal law administered by nhtsa including the cafe standard theft prevention act requirement consumer information labeling requirement early warning reporting requirement regarding warranty claim field report death and injury report and foreign recall and owner manual requirement the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturer of motor vehicle to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition the act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy rating determined by epa well crash test rating determined by nhtsa if such test are conducted our vehicle sold in outside of the are subject to foreign safety testing regulation many of those regulation are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standard applicable in the united state and may require redesign and or retesting regulation epa emission certificate of conformity the clean air act requires that we obtain both an epa issued certificate of conformity and california air resource board carb issued executive order with respect to emission for our vehicle the certificate of conformity is required for vehicle sold in state covered by the clean air act standard and both the certificate of conformity and the executive order are required for vehicle sold in state that have sought and received waiver from the epa to utilize california standard the california standard for emission control for certain regulated pollutant for new vehicle and engine sold in california are set by carb state that have adopted the california standard approved by epa also recognize the executive order for sale of vehicle regulation battery safety and testing our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulation that govern transport of dangerous good defined to include lithium ion battery which may present risk in transportation the governing regulation issued by the pipeline and hazardous material safety administration phmsa are based on the united nation un recommendation and model regulation on the transport of dangerous good well related un manual test and criterion the regulation vary by mode of shipping transportation such by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation test for our prototype and production battery pack demonstrating our compliance with the un manual of test and criterion we also subject our battery pack to the appropriate test specified in the society of automotive engineer sae and standard which incorporate test such immersion humidity and exposure to fire we use lithium metal oxide cell in our high voltage battery pack the cell do not contain any lead mercury cadmium other hazardous material heavy metal or toxic material our battery pack include certain packaging material that contain trace amount of hazardous chemical whose use storage and disposal is regulated under federal law we currently have an agreement with third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery pack if customer wish to dispose of battery pack from one of our vehicle we anticipate accepting the depleted battery from the customer without any additional charge automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation state law regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobile and generally require motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer to be licensed in order to sell vehicle directly to consumer in the state we open additional tesla store and service center we secure dealer license or their equivalent and engage in sale activity to sell our vehicle directly to consumer few state such texas and michigan do not permit automobile manufacturer to be licensed dealer or to act in the capacity of dealer or otherwise restrict manufacturer ability to deliver or service vehicle to sell vehicle to resident of state where we are not licensed dealer we must generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such state we have opened gallery that serve an educational purpose and are not retail location we expand our retail footprint in the united state some automobile dealer trade association have both challenged the legality of our operation in court and used administrative and legislative process to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing store or expand to new location although we have thus far prevailed in every lawsuit brought by dealer association we expect that the dealer association will continue to mount challenge to our business model in addition we expect the dealer association to actively lobbying state governor and legislator to interpret existing law or enact new law in way not favorable to tesla ownership and operation of it own retail and service location while we have analyzed the principal law in the eu china japan uk and australia relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such law we have not performed complete analysis of all jurisdiction in which we may sell vehicle accordingly there may be law in certain jurisdiction that may restrict our sale and service operation competition the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future we introduce additional lower priced vehicle such our model we believe the impact of new regulatory requirement for occupant safety and vehicle emission technological advance in powertrain and consumer electronics component and shifting customer need and expectation are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electric based vehicle we believe the primary competitive factor in our market include but are not limited to technological innovation product quality and safety service option product performance design and styling brand perception product price and manufacturing efficiency we believe that our vehicle compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification well based on their propulsion technology for example model competes primarily in the extremely competitive premium sedan market with internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer including audi bmw lexus and mercedes our vehicle also compete with vehicle propelled by alternative fuel principally electricity many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market bmw daimler nissan fiat ford and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicle available today moreover porsche lexus audi volkswagen and volvo are also developing electric vehicle electric vehicle have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign country and we expect number of those manufacturer to enter the united state market well in addition several manufacturer including general motor toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicle and certain of these manufacturer have announced plug in version of their hybrid vehicle most of our current and potential competitor have significantly greater resource than we do may be able to devote greater resource to the manufacture sale and support of their product and have other advantage we believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicle and electric vehicle component well our history of vehicle development and production however are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenge posed by our competition intellectual property part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property right in various way including through trademark copyright trade secret including know patent patent application employee and third party nondisclosure agreement intellectual property license and other contractual right additionally consistent with our mission to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport we announced patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting ourselves other company making electric vehicle and the world segment information we have determined that we operate one reportable segment which is the design development manufacturing and sale of electric vehicle and electric powertrain component for information regarding financial data by geographic area see note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report on form under item financial statement and supplementary data employee of december we had full time employee to date we

thereto proxy statement and other information are also made available free of charge on our investor relation website at ir teslamotors com soon reasonably practicable after we electronically file or furnish such information with the sec the information posted on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on form item risk factor you should carefully consider the risk described together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our business and industry we may experience significant delay or other complication in the design manufacture launch and production ramp of model well future vehicle such model which could harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we may experience significant delay or other complication in bringing new vehicle to market for example while we expect model delivery to start in the third quarter of refinement resulting from ongoing development and extensive testing of this vehicle could result in delay in it introduction complication could also arise from other factor including the expansion of our production capacity required to bring model to market finalization of it supply chain and completion of regulatory approval ahead of the model launch we plan to expand capacity in several area for our current and future vehicle including installing state of the art highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum component for our vehicle increasing production on our new drive unit line installing new robotic body assembly shop for model production and commissioning new paint facility our supplier may not be able to provide component in timely manner at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantity finally we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that model is in compliance with applicable nhtsa safety regulation and obtain epa and carb certification to emission regulation prior to beginning volume production and delivery of the vehicle we well other automobile manufacturer have experienced delay or other complication in connection with new vehicle model in we experienced delay in the production ramp of model and in we delayed the start of production ramp of all wheel drive dual motor model any significant delay or other complication in the development manufacture launch and production ramp of model or our future vehicle including complication associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain or regulatory approval could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result our long term success will be dependent upon our ability to design build and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle model specifically model and new vehicle model such model and model our long term success is dependent on market acceptance of the model sedan and future electric vehicle we introduce in the united state there is no guarantee that model will continue to be successfully accepted by the general public especially in the long term we expand in europe and asia there is no guarantee that customer in these market will embrace our vehicle and if they do not demand for our vehicle could be lower than our expectation moreover there can be no assurance that we will be able to design future electric vehicle that will meet the expectation of our customer or that our future model including the model crossover will become commercially viable to date we have publicly revealed only an early prototype of the model work continues on the finalization of model with beta model vehicle undergoing extensive testing to the extent that we are not able to build model in accordance with the expectation created by the early prototype and our announced specification and schedule customer may cancel their reservation our future sale could be harmed and investor may lose confidence in in addition we have also announced our intent to develop model which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model we intend to offer this vehicle at lower price point and expect to produce it at higher volume than our model importantly we anticipate producing model for the mass market and thus we will need high volume supply of lithium ion cell at reasonable price while we intend each of our production vehicle and their variant to meet distinct segment of the automotive market our vehicle may end up competing with each other which may delay sale and associated revenue to future period also if we fail to accurately anticipate demand for each of our vehicle this could result in inefficient expenditure and production delay furthermore historically automobile customer have come to expect new and improved vehicle model to be introduced frequently in order to meet these expectation we may be required to introduce on regular basis new vehicle model well enhanced version of existing vehicle model automotive technology change including those specific to electric vehicle we anticipate our customer will expect to upgrade or adapt our vehicle and introduce new model in order to continue to provide vehicle with the latest technology to date we have limited experience simultaneously designing testing manufacturing upgrading adapting and selling our electric vehicle well limited experience allocating our available resource among the design and production of multiple vehicle we may be unable to increase production and delivery of model in line with our plan both of which could harm our business and prospect since we began manufacturing and delivering model in we have significantly increased production and delivery and our plan call for an even greater increase in production and delivery going forward part of this effort we recently completed new final assembly line and added more automation to our body shop at the fremont factory are installing highly automated casting and machining operation for various aluminum component and are finishing the construction of new high volume paint shop our ability to further ramp up high volume model production including for the all wheel drive dual motor model which we recently began producing for the first time will depend upon number of factor including our ability to use these new manufacturing process planned while maintaining our desired quality level our supplier ability to deliver quality part to in timely manner and efficiently making design change to ensure consistently high quality to produce vehicle that meet our quality standard requires to carefully analyze each step of our production plan improve the efficiency of our manufacturing process and continue to train our employee our supplier also must produce new product in sufficient quantity and quality to meet our demand certain supplier have experienced delay in meeting our demand or have sought to renegotiate the term of the supply arrangement and we continue to focus on supplier capability and constraint any disruption in increasing our production level of model in line with our plan could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition for model we have introduced number of new manufacturing technology and technique such aluminum spot welding system which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry and the model ha number of new and unique design feature such inch display screen retractable exterior door handle and all new dual motor and autopilot hardware each of which pose unique manufacturing challenge model production and delivery will continue to require significant resource and we may experience unexpected delay or difficulty that could harm our ability to maintain full manufacturing capacity for model or cause to miss planned production target any of which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result additionally sustaining high volume production and doing so in manner that avoids significant cost overrun including result of factor beyond our control such problem with supplier and vendor may be difficult concurrent with the significant increase in our planned production level we will also need to continue to significantly increase our delivery of model vehicle we have limited experience in delivering high volume of model vehicle and in particular to location outside of the united state we may face difficulty meeting our delivery and growth plan in asia and the right hand drive market we have entered which may impact our ability to achieve our worldwide delivery goal if we are unable to ramp up to meet our delivery goal globally to match our production rate of model this could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result our ability to grow volume production and delivery for model is subject to certain risk and uncertainty including that our supplier will be able and willing to deliver component on timely basis and in the necessary quantity quality and at acceptable price to produce model in volume and reach our financial target that we will be able to complete any necessary adjustment to the vehicle design or manufacturing process of model in timely manner that meet our production plan and allows for high quality vehicle that we will be able to fully ramp production of all wheel drive dual motor model to keep up with demand that we will be able to ramp sale of model throughout asia pursuant to our current timeline that we will be able to adequately respond in timely manner to any problem that may arise with our vehicle that we will be able to schedule and complete delivery at our planned higher volume production level that the equipment or tooling which we have purchased or which we select including those that are part of our higher capacity production line that recently became operational will be able to accurately manufacture the vehicle within specified design tolerance and will not suffer from unexpected breakdown or damage which could negatively affect the rate needed to produce vehicle in volume that we will be able to comply with environmental workplace safety custom and similar regulation required to operate our manufacturing facility that we will be able to maintain and improve quality control we transition to higher level of in house manufacturing process and that the information technology system that we are currently expanding and improving upon will be effective to manage higher volume production finally detailed long term testing of quality reliability and durability of model is ongoing and any negative result from such testing could cause production or delivery delay cost increase or lower quality of our model vehicle problem or delay in bringing the gigafactory online and operating it in line with our expectation could negatively affect to lower the cost of cell production and produce cell in volume to allow to grow quickly we intend to integrate the production of lithium ion cell and finished battery pack for our vehicle at our new gigafactory our gigafactory plan however is at an early stage while we recently entered into various formal agreement with panasonic on the gigafactory we have very little experience in building factory of the size and scope planned for the gigafactory and no experience directly in the production of lithium ion cell in addition to date we have not finalized agreement with additional gigafactory partner that will be co located at the gigafactory also the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectation and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate if we are unable to build the gigafactory in timely manner to produce high volume of quality lithium ion cell at reasonable price then our ability to supply battery pack to our vehicle including model according to our schedule and or at price that allows to sell them profitably and in the quantity we estimate could be constrained any such problem or delay with gigafactory could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result if our vehicle or vehicle that contain our powertrains fail to perform expected or if we suffer product recall our ability to develop market and sell our electric vehicle could be harmed our vehicle or vehicle that contain our powertrains such the toyota ev or the mercedes benz class ev may contain defect in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform expected or that may require repair for example our vehicle are highly dependent on software to operate software product are inherently complex and often contain defect and error when first introduced and change to software may have unexpected effect model issue experienced by customer include those related to the software for the inch display screen the panoramic roof and the volt battery although we attempt to remedy the model issue experienced by our customer in rapid manner such effort may not be timely or up to the satisfaction of our customer while we have performed extensive internal testing we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the long term performance of our battery pack powertrains and vehicle specifically we have only limited amount of data by which to evaluate model upon which our business prospect depend due to the fact that we only recently began production in june there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in the vehicle prior to their sale to consumer we have experienced product recall including in may october and june all of which were unrelated to our electric powertrain in may we initiated product recall after we determined that condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadster result of missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider which is the partially assembled tesla roadster that not contain our electric powertrain in october we initiated product recall for some of our tesla roadster after the volt low voltage auxiliary cable in single vehicle chafed against the edge of carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june we initiated recall of slightly more than thousand model vehicle to inspect and repair rear seat striker that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat striker are used to retain the rear seat back in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in the collapse of the rear seat back during crash although the cost of this recall wa not material and limited to small number of total model produced we may experience additional recall in the future which could adversely affect our brand in our target market well our business prospect and result of operation in january we implemented firmware update to address issue with certain universal mobile connector nema adapter which are part of the charging unit and are not part of the vehicle potentially overheating during charging we further announced that we would provide upgraded nema adapter to our customer an additional safeguard if such measure do not adequately address the underlying concern our business prospect and result of operation could be harmed our electric vehicle may not perform consistent with customer expectation or consistent with other vehicle currently available for example our electric vehicle may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicle and may not be easy to repair other vehicle currently on the market additionally while model recently achieved an overall five star safety rating by nhtsa there is no guarantee that future model year or variant or other tesla vehicle will also attain such safety rating and any such rating is not guarantee of safe product design or that any individual vehicle will be free of any defect or failure any product defect or any other failure of our performance electric vehicle to perform expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity lost revenue delivery delay product recall product liability claim harm to our brand and reputation and significant warranty and other expense and could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating result and prospect we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to continue to deliver or their refusal to deliver necessary component of our vehicle in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to would have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result model contains numerous purchased part which we source globally from over direct supplier the majority of whom are currently single source supplier for these component we expect that model will be sourced in an approximately similar manner while we obtain component from multiple source whenever possible similar to other automobile manufacturer the majority of the component used in our vehicle are purchased by from single source to date we have not qualified alternative source for most of the single sourced component used in our vehicle and we do not maintain long term agreement with number of our supplier while we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationship and can obtain or engineer replacement component for our single source component we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at price or cost that are favorable to in particular while we believe that we will be able to secure alternate source of supply for most of our single sourced component in relatively short time frame qualifying alternate supplier or developing our own replacement for certain highly customized component of our vehicle may be time consuming costly and may force to make additional modification to vehicle design this limited supply chain expose to multiple potential source of delivery failure or component shortage for our vehicle well for our powertrain component sale activity for example earthquake similar to the one that occurred in japan in march or labor issue such work stoppage or strike at the port on the west coast could negatively impact our supply chain we have in the past experienced source disruption in our supply chain including those relating to our slower than anticipated ramp in our model production goal for we may experience additional delay in the future with respect to model model and any other future vehicle we may produce in addition we have written agreement in place with the majority but not all of our supplier this may create uncertainty regarding supplier obligation to including but not limited to those regarding warranty and product liability change in business condition war governmental change and other factor beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate could also affect our supplier ability to deliver component to on timely basis furthermore if we experience significantly increased demand or need to replace certain existing supplier there can be no assurance that additional supply of component part will be available when required on term that are favorable to at all or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supply to in order to meet our requirement or fill our order in timely manner in the past we have replaced certain supplier because of their failure to provide component that met our quality control standard the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of component from these supplier could lead to delay in vehicle delivery to our customer which could hurt our relationship with our customer and also materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating result change in our supply chain have resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost and delay we have also experienced cost increase from certain of our supplier in order to meet our quality target and development timeline well due to design change that we made and we may experience similar cost increase in the future additionally we are negotiating with existing supplier for cost reduction seeking new and le expensive supplier for certain part and attempting to redesign certain part to make them cheaper to produce if we are unsuccessful in our effort to control and reduce supplier cost our operating result will suffer additionally cost reduction effort may interrupt or harm our normal production process thereby harming vehicle quality or reducing model production output furthermore failure by our supplier to provide the component in timely manner or at the level of quality necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicle could prevent from fulfilling customer order in timely fashion which could result in negative publicity damage our brand and have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result finally in october we entered into an amendment to our existing supply agreement with panasonic corporation in order to address our anticipated short to medium term lithium ion battery cell need while we expect that this supply agreement amended will provide with sufficient cell for the next few year we may not be able to meet our long term need including for model and other program we may introduce without securing additional supplier or other source for cell we have recently signed an agreement with panasonic to be our partner in the gigafactory and be responsible for among other thing manufacturing cell from there for use in our product if we encounter unexpected difficulty with our current supplier including panasonic and if we are unable to fill these need from other supplier we could experience production delay which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result our future growth is dependent upon consumer willingness to adopt electric vehicle our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumer of and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for alternative fuel vehicle in general and electric vehicle in particular if the market for electric vehicle in north america europe and asia doe not develop we expect or develops more slowly than we expect our business prospect financial condition and operating result will be harmed the market for alternative fuel vehicle is relatively new rapidly evolving characterized by rapidly changing technology price competition additional competitor evolving government regulation and industry standard frequent new vehicle announcement and changing consumer demand and behavior other factor that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicle and specifically electric vehicle include perception about electric vehicle quality safety in particular with respect to lithium ion battery pack design performance and cost especially if adverse event or accident occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicle such those related to the chevrolet volt battery pack fire or incident involving model perception about vehicle safety in general in particular safety issue that may be attributed to the use of advanced technology including vehicle electronics and regenerative braking system negative perception of electric vehicle such that they are more expensive than non electric vehicle and are only affordable with government subsidy the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge and the effect of weather on this range the decline of an electric vehicle range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery ability to hold charge varied calculation for driving range achievable by ev which is inherently difficult given numerous factor affecting battery range concern about electric grid capacity and reliability which could derail our past and present effort to promote electric vehicle practical solution to vehicle which require gasoline concern by potential customer that if their battery pack is not charged properly it may become unusable and may need to be replaced the availability of alternative fuel vehicle including plug in hybrid electric vehicle improvement in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine the availability of service for electric vehicle consumer desire and ability to purchase luxury automobile or one that is perceived exclusive the environmental consciousness of consumer volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline consumer perception of the dependency of the united state on oil from unstable or hostile country government regulation and economic incentive promoting fuel efficiency and alternate form of energy well tax and other governmental incentive to purchase and operate electric vehicle access to charging facility standardization of electric vehicle charging system and consumer perception about convenience and cost to charge an electric vehicle and perception about and the actual cost of alternative fuel in addition report have suggested the potential for extreme temperature to affect the range or performance of electric vehicle and based on our own internal testing we estimate that our vehicle may experience material reduction in range when operated in extremely cold temperature to the extent customer have concern about such reduction or third party report which suggest reduction in range greater than our estimate gain widespread acceptance our ability to market and sell our vehicle particularly in colder climate may be adversely impacted additionally we will become subject to regulation that require to alter the design of our vehicle which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicle for example our electric vehicle make le noise than internal combustion vehicle due to concern about quiet vehicle and vision impaired pedestrian in january congress passed and the president signed the pedestrian safety enhancement act of the new law requires nhtsa to establish minimum sound for electric vehicle and hybrid electric vehicle when travelling at low speed nhtsa issued notice of proposed rulemaking in and plan to finalize rule soon sometime in with potential effective date for implementation early this will begin three year phase in schedule for establishing these minimum sound in all electric and hybrid electric vehicle adding this artificial noise may cause current or potential customer not to purchase our electric vehicle which would materially and adversely affect our business operating result financial condition and prospect if we fail to manage future growth effectively we rapidly grow our company especially internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our vehicle successfully any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition we continue to expand our operation significantly in north america well in europe and asia our future operating result depend to large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully risk that we face in undertaking this global expansion include finding and training new personnel especially in new market such europe and asia controlling expense and investment in anticipation of expanded operation establishing or expanding sale service and supercharger facility in timely manner adapting our product to meet local requirement in country around the world and implementing and enhancing manufacturing logistics and administrative infrastructure system and process we intend to continue to hire significant number of additional personnel including manufacturing personnel design personnel engineer and service technician because our high performance vehicle are based on different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engine we may not be able to hire individual with sufficient training in electric vehicle and we will need to expend significant time and expense training the employee we do hire competition for individual with experience designing manufacturing and servicing electric vehicle is intense and we may not be able to attract assimilate train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future the failure of which could seriously harm our business prospect operating result and financial condition if we are unable to adequately reduce the manufacturing cost of model control manufacturing cost for model or otherwise control the cost associated with operating our business our financial condition and operating result will suffer our production cost for model were high initially due to start up cost at the tesla factory manufacturing inefficiency including low absorption of fixed manufacturing cost higher logistics cost due to the immaturity of our supply chain and higher initial price for component part during the initial period after the launch and ramp of model we have gradually ramped production of model manufacturing cost per vehicle have decreased while we expect further cost reduction to be realized by both and our supplier during the next several quarter there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost saving to reach our gross margin and profitability goal we incur significant cost related to procuring the raw material required to manufacture our high performance electric car assembling vehicle and compensating our personnel we may also incur substantial cost or cost overrun in increasing the production capability of model and powertrain manufacturing facility and the recent launch in asia furthermore if we are unable to produce model pursuant to our plan due to cost overrun or other unexpected cost we may not be able to meet our gross margin target furthermore many of the factor that impact our operating cost are beyond our control for example the cost of our raw material and component such lithium ion battery cell or aluminum used to produce body panel could increase due to shortage global demand for these product increase indeed if the popularity of electric vehicle exceeds current expectation without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancement in battery cell technology shortage could occur which would result in increased material cost to or potentially limit our ability to expand production additionally we may be required to incur substantial marketing cost and expense to promote our vehicle including through the use of traditional medium such television radio and print even though our marketing expense to date have been relatively limited we have to date relied upon unconventional marketing effort if we are unable to keep our operating cost aligned with the level of revenue we generate our operating result business and prospect will be harmed we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectation about our business which would cause our stock price to decline we occasionally provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such projection regarding the number of vehicle we hope to sell produce or deliver in future period and anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability and cash flow correctly identifying the key factor affecting business condition and predicting future event is inherently an uncertain process our guidance is based in part on assumption which include but are not limited to assumption regarding our ability to achieve anticipated production and sale volume and projected average sale price for model and model in north america europe and asia supplier and commodity related cost and planned cost reduction such guidance may not always be accurate or may vary from actual result due to our inability to meet our assumption and the impact on our financial performance that could occur result of the various risk and uncertainty to our business set forth in these risk factor or because of the way that applicable accounting rule require to treat new product and service offering that we may offer we offer no assurance that such guidance will ultimately be accurate and investor should treat any such guidance with appropriate caution if we fail to meet our guidance or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance even if such failure or revision is seemingly insignificant investor and analyst may lose confidence in and the market value of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected our vehicle make use of lithium ion battery cell which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such event have raised concern and future event may lead to additional concern about the battery used in automotive application the battery pack in our vehicle and the battery pack that we sell to toyota and daimler make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell extremely rare incident of laptop computer cell phone and electric vehicle battery pack catching fire have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cell these event have raised concern about the battery used in automotive application to address these question and concern number of cell manufacturer are pursuing alternative lithium ion battery cell chemistry to improve safety we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell however we have delivered only limited number of our vehicle to customer and have limited field experience with them we have also only delivered limited number of battery pack to toyota and daimler accordingly there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject to lawsuit we may have to recall our vehicle or participate in recall of vehicle that contains our battery pack and redesign our battery pack which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perception regarding the suitability of lithium ion cell for automotive application or any future incident involving lithium ion cell such vehicle or other fire even if such incident doe not involve could seriously harm our business in addition we store significant number of lithium ion cell at our manufacturing facility any mishandling of battery cell may cause disruption to the operation of our facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse publicity and potentially safety recall moreover any failure of competitor electric vehicle especially those that use high volume of commodity cell similar to tesla vehicle may cause indirect adverse publicity for and our electric vehicle such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result we have history of loss and have to deliver significant cost reduction to achieve sustained long term profitability and long term commercial success we have had net loss on gaap basis in each quarter since our inception except for the first quarter of even if we are able to continue to increase model production and sale and begin to produce and sell model and future vehicle there can be no assurance that we will be profitable in order to achieve profitability well long term commercial success we must continue to achieve our planned cost reduction control our operational cost while producing quality vehicle increase our production rate maintain strong demand in north america and grow demand abroad in europe and asia failure to do one or more of these thing could prevent from achieving sustained long term profitability foreign currency movement relative to the dollar could harm our financial result our revenue and cost denominated in foreign currency are not completely matched we have increased model delivery in market outside of the united state we have much higher revenue than cost denominated in other currency such the euro norwegian krone and chinese yuan the recent strengthening of the dollar therefore ha reduced and any further strengthening of the dollar would tend to further reduce our revenue measured in dollar in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer result our operating result could be adversely affected the introduction of our resale value guarantee and leasing program may result in lower revenue and profit and expose to resale risk to the extent many customer elect to return their vehicle to and the residual value are lower than our estimate in we began offering resale value guarantee to all customer who purchased model in the united state and canada and financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partner in april and october of we started offering leasing to business customer and individual customer respectively including through tesla finance our captive finance company both the resale value guarantee program and leasing offered through tesla finance generate lower revenue in the period the car is delivered compared to cash purchase and both expose to the risk that any vehicle repurchased or returned to under the program may be resold by for price le than we estimate under the resale value guarantee program model customer have the option of selling their vehicle back to during the period of to month following delivery for pre determined resale value result of this resale value guarantee and customer having the option of selling their vehicle to we apply lease accounting to such purchase which defers the recognition of the associated revenue over time instead of full recognition at vehicle delivery although the resale value guarantee doe not impact our cash flow and liquidity at the time of vehicle delivery significant uptake under this program could have significant adverse impact on our near term gaap revenue and operating result under the leasing program offered through tesla finance we lease vehicle directly to customer customer have the option of purchasing their vehicle at the stated value in the leasing contract or returning their vehicle to we apply lease accounting to such purchase unlike the resale value guarantee program we may receive only very small portion of the price of the vehicle from our customer at the time of purchase and instead will receive stream of lease payment to the extent we expand this program and are unable to secure appropriate financing our cash flow and liquidity well our near term gaap revenue and operating result could be negatively impacted furthermore we are exposed to credit risk that customer may not pay their lease payment on time and according to the term of our leasing contract under both program we are exposed to the risk that the vehicle resale value may be lower than our estimate and the volume of vehicle returned to may be higher than our estimate which could impact our future cash flow and or profitability currently there is only very limited secondary market for our electric vehicle on which to base our estimate and such secondary market may not develop in the future our residual value and return volume estimate could prove to be incorrect either of which could harm our financial condition and operating result increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of raw material in particular lithium ion cell could harm our business we may experience increase in the cost or sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw material any such increase or supply interruption could materially and negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we use various raw material in our business including aluminum steel nickel and copper the price for these raw material fluctuate depending on market condition and global demand for these material and could adversely affect our business and operating result for instance we are exposed to multiple risk relating to lithium ion cell these risk include the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturer to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plant to supply the number of lithium ion cell required to support the growth of the electric or plug in hybrid vehicle industry demand for such cell increase disruption in the supply of cell due to quality issue or recall by battery cell manufacturer an increase in the cost of raw material such nickel used in lithium ion cell or aluminum used in the body of model and fluctuation in the value of the japanese yen against the dollar our battery cell purchase are currently denominated in japanese yen our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cell for our vehicle battery pack well for the battery pack we produce for other automobile manufacturer while we believe several source of the battery cell are available for such battery pack we have fully qualified only one supplier for the cell used in such battery pack and have very limited flexibility in changing cell supplier any disruption in the supply of battery cell from such vendor could disrupt production of our vehicle and of the battery pack we produce for other automobile manufacturer such time different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuation or shortage in petroleum and other economic condition may cause to experience significant increase in freight charge and raw material cost substantial increase in the price for our raw material or price charged to such those charged by our battery cell manufacturer would increase our operating cost and could reduce our margin if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased electric vehicle price there can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing cost of raw material by increasing vehicle price any attempt to increase vehicle price in response to increased raw material cost could be viewed negatively by our customer result in cancellation of vehicle order and reservation and could materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospect and operating result our success could be harmed by negative publicity regarding our company or our product particularly model occasionally third party evaluate or publish story regarding our vehicle for example in the new york time published negative review of the model and our supercharger network on route from washington to boston the story created negative public perception about model it capability and the supercharger network to the extent that negative comment about or our product are believed by the public this may cause current or potential customer not to purchase our electric vehicle including model and model which can materially and adversely affect our business operating result financial condition and prospect our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturer which make evaluating our business operating result and future prospect difficult our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today particularly in the united state we plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicle in company owned tesla store and over the internet while we believe our approach is important to the success of our technology and vehicle this model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven especially in the united state and subject to substantial risk it requires in the aggregate significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sale system than may be possible by utilizing more traditional dealer franchise system for example we do not utilize long established sale channel developed through franchise system to increase our sale volume which may harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result moreover we compete with company with well established distribution channel we have opened tesla store in north america europe and the asia pacific region many of which have been open for only short period of time we have relatively limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicle through our tesla store especially in asia our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sale channel and marketing strategy implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenge including obtaining permit and approval from local and state authority and we may not be successful in addressing these challenge the concept and layout of our interactive store which are typically located in high profile retail center is different than what ha previously been used in automotive sale we do not know whether our store strategy will continue to be successful we may incur additional cost in order to improve or change our retail strategy other aspect of our distribution model also differ from those used by traditional automobile manufacturer for example we do not anticipate that we will ever carry significant amount of vehicle inventory at our store and customer may need to wait up to few month from the time they place an order until the time they receive their vehicle this type of custom manufacturing is unusual in the premium sedan market in the united state and it is unproven whether the average customer will be willing to wait this amount of time for such vehicle if customer do not embrace this ordering and retail experience our business will be harmed we may become subject to product liability claim which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claim we may become subject to product liability claim which could harm our business prospect operating result and financial condition the automobile industry experience significant product liability claim and we face inherent risk of exposure to claim in the event our vehicle do not perform expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death our risk in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicle delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicle successful product liability claim against could require to pay substantial monetary award moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicle and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidate which would have material adverse effect on our brand business prospect and operating result we self insure against the risk of product liability claim meaning that any product liability claim will have to be paid from company fund not by insurance any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damage may have material adverse effect on our reputation business and financial condition we may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable term or at reasonable cost when needed particularly if we do face liability for our product and are forced to make claim under such policy we are currently expanding and improving our information technology system if these implementation are not successful our business and operation could be disrupted and our operating result could be harmed we are currently expanding and improving our information technology system including implementing new internally developed system to assist in the management of our business in particular our volume production of model necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology system in the and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system these system support our operation and enable to produce model and future vehicle like model in volume the implementation maintenance and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sale and service process these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicle or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation we can not be sure that these expanded system or their required functionality will be effectively implemented or sufficiently maintained if we do not successfully implement improve or maintain these system our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function we may not realize the benefit of our supercharger network which could harm our business brand and operating result we continue to deploy tesla supercharger in the united state europe and asia tesla supercharger are network of charging station designed to provide fast charge capability to owner of model vehicle with the supercharging option we intend to expand the tesla supercharger network throughout the canada europe and asia but we may be unable to do so due to number of factor including the inability to secure or delay in securing suitable location and permit problem negotiating lease with landowner or obtaining required permit for such location difficulty in interfacing with the infrastructure of various utility company and greater than expected cost and difficulty of installing maintaining and operating the network we may also be unable to expand the supercharger network fast we intend or the public expects or to place the charging station in place our customer believe to be optimal furthermore even where supercharger exist the increasing number of model vehicle well future vehicle such model may oversaturate the available charging bay at such supercharger leading to increased wait time and dissatisfaction for customer in addition we have announced that we will not be charging our customer to access this network in addition to what they have already paid for their vehicle any significant unexpected cost that we encounter will entirely be borne by and may harm our operating result although our supercharger network is intended to address customer concern regarding long distance travel this network may not result in increased reservation or sale of model or future vehicle like model if our supercharger network is not expanded currently planned or quickly planned we may not realize the benefit of our supercharger network and our business and operating result could be materially affected if we are unable to design develop market and sell new electric vehicle that address additional market opportunity our business prospect and operating result will suffer we may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicle address new market segment or develop significantly broader customer base in we publicly revealed an early prototype of the model crossover the first vehicle we intend to develop by leveraging the model platform and are currently testing our beta model vehicle we have also announced our intent to develop model based on smaller platform than the model which we expect to produce at the tesla factory after the introduction of model model is currently planned to be lower cost smaller sedan designed for the mass market therefore we intend to manufacture model in significantly higher volume than model and there can be no assurance we can successfully scale our business accordingly in addition we have not yet finalized the design engineering or component sourcing plan for model and there are no assurance that we will be able to bring this vehicle to market at the price point and in the volume that we currently intend if at all the market for vehicle in the price range we expect for model is much more competitive than for model and model and therefore margin are likely to be lower compared to model and model margin our effort to manufacture and sell sufficiently profitable model may not be successful and therefore our business prospect and operating result may suffer our failure to address additional market opportunity would harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result the automotive market is highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in this industry we currently face competition from new and established competitor and expect to face competition from others in the future the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future other automobile manufacturer entered the electric vehicle market at the end of and we expect additional competitor to enter this market with respect to model we face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturer in the extremely competitive premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market bmw daimler nissan fiat ford and mitsubishi among others have electric vehicle available today moreover porsche lexus audi volkswagen and volvo are also developing electric vehicle in addition several manufacturer including general motor toyota ford and honda are each selling hybrid vehicle and certain of these manufacturer have announced plug in version of their hybrid vehicle for example in december general motor introduced the chevrolet volt which is plug in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for limited number of mile at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery pack moreover it ha been reported that many of the other large oems such daimler lexus and audi are also developing electric vehicle several new start ups have also entered or announced plan to enter the market for performance electric vehicle finally electric vehicle have already been brought to market in china and other foreign country and we expect number of those manufacturer to enter the united state market well most of our current and potential competitor have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing and other resource than we do and may be able to devote greater resource to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product virtually all of our competitor have more extensive customer base and broader customer and industry relationship than we do in addition almost all of these company have longer operating history and greater name recognition than we do our competitor may be in stronger position to respond quickly to new technology and may be able to design develop market and sell their product more effectively additionally we have not in the past and do not currently offer customary discount on our vehicle like most of our competitor do we expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicle continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry factor affecting competition include product quality and feature innovation and development time pricing reliability safety fuel economy customer service and financing term increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sale and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business financial condition operating result and prospect our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new market and our market share there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in our market if our competitor introduce new car or service that compete with or surpass the quality price or performance of our car or service we may be unable to satisfy existing customer or attract new customer at the price and level that would allow to generate attractive rate of return on our investment increased competition could result in price reduction and revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result demand in the automobile industry is volatile which may lead to lower vehicle unit sale and adversely affect our operating result volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition the market in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent period demand for automobile sale depends to large extent on general economic political and social condition in given market and the introduction of new vehicle and technology low volume producer we have le financial resource than more established automobile manufacturer to withstand change in the market and disruption in demand our business grows economic condition and trend in other country and region where we currently or will sell our electric vehicle such europe and asia will impact our business prospect and operating result well demand for our electric vehicle may also be affected by factor directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobile such sale and financing incentive price of raw material and part and component cost of fuel and governmental regulation including tariff import regulation and other tax volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sale and increased inventory which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business prospect financial condition and operating result these effect may have more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resource compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturer if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long term business prospect among consumer analyst and within our industry then our financial condition operating result business prospect and stock price may suffer materially our vehicle are highly technical product that require maintenance and support if we were to cease or cut back operation even year from buyer of our vehicle from year earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicle and obtaining satisfactory support result consumer may be le likely to purchase our vehicle now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operation will continue for many year similarly supplier and other third party will be le likely to invest time and resource in developing business relationship with if they are not convinced that our business will succeed if we are required to curtail our expansion plan in the future we have done in the past this may result in negative perception regarding our long term business prospect and may lead to cancellation of model or model order and reservation accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst and other party in our liquidity and long term business prospect in contrast to some more established automaker we believe that in our case the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factor such the following our limited operating history unfamiliarity with or uncertainty about model and future tesla vehicle uncertainty about the long term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicle generally or electric vehicle specifically the perceived prospect that we will need ongoing infusion of external capital to fund our planned operation the size of our expansion plan in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operation and the prospect or actual emergence of direct sustained competitive pressure from more established automaker which may be more likely if our initial effort are perceived to be commercially successful many of these factor are largely outside our control and any negative perception about our long term business prospect even if exaggerated or unfounded would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund when needed we have limited experience servicing our vehicle especially in certain region outside of the united state and we are using different service model from the one typically used in the industry if we are unable to address the service requirement of our existing and future customer our business will be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to successfully address the service requirement of our existing and future customer and meet customer expectation regarding service our business and prospect will be materially and adversely affected we have limited experience servicing our vehicle especially in europe and asia servicing electric vehicle is different than servicing vehicle with internal combustion engine and requires specialized skill including high voltage training and servicing technique if we are unable to satisfactorily service our customer and the various service related issue that they are facing and may face in the future our ability to generate customer loyalty grow our business and sell additional vehicle could be impaired we service our performance electric vehicle through our company owned tesla service center certain of our store and through our mobile service technician known the tesla ranger however certain service center have been open for short period such those outside of the united state and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicle at these location we will need to open new standalone service center in location around the world and hire and train significant number of new employee to staff these service center and act tesla ranger in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicle we only implemented our tesla ranger program in october and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customer vehicle there can be no assurance that these service arrangement or our limited experience servicing our vehicle will adequately address the service requirement of our customer to their satisfaction or that we will have sufficient resource to meet these service requirement in timely manner the volume of vehicle we are able to deliver annually increase we do not expect to be able to open tesla service center in all the geographic area in which our existing and potential customer may reside in order to address the service need of customer who are not in geographical proximity to our service center we plan to either transport those vehicle to the nearest tesla store or service center for servicing or deploy our mobile tesla ranger to service the vehicle at the customer location these special arrangement may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the cost of providing these service to our customer in addition number of potential customer may choose not to purchase our vehicle because of the lack of more widespread service network if we do not adequately address our customer service need our brand and reputation will be adversely affected which in turn could have material and adverse impact on our business financial condition operating result and prospect traditional automobile manufacturer in the united state do not provide maintenance and repair service directly consumer must rather service their vehicle through franchised dealership or through third party maintenance service provider we do not have any such arrangement with third party service provider and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service provider will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicle at this point we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicle for the foreseeable future our vehicle are placed in more location we may encounter negative reaction from our consumer who are frustrated that they can not use local service station to the same extent they have with their conventional automobile and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sale thereby harming our business and prospect in addition the motor vehicle industry law in many state require that service facility be available with respect to vehicle physically sold from location in the state whether these law would also require that service facility be available with respect to vehicle sold over the internet to consumer in state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain while we believe our tesla ranger program and our practice of transporting customer vehicle to our nearest tesla service center would satisfy regulator in these circumstance without seeking formal regulatory guidance there are no assurance that regulator will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facility in their state further certain state franchise law which prohibit manufacturer from being licensed dealer or acting in the capacity of dealer also restrict manufacturer from providing vehicle service if issue arise in connection with these law certain aspect of tesla service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law which may harm our business we may not succeed in maintaining and strengthening the tesla brand which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicle and component and our business revenue and prospect our business and prospect are heavily dependent on our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand any failure to develop maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the model model model and other future planned electric vehicle and sell our electric powertrain component if we do not continue to establish maintain and strengthen our brand we may lose the opportunity to build critical mass of customer promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric car and maintenance and repair service and we have very limited experience in these area any problem associated with the toyota ev and mercedes benz class ev both of which use tesla powertrain or the model may hurt the tesla brand in addition we expect that our ability to develop maintain and strengthen the tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing effort to date we have limited experience with marketing activity we have relied primarily on the internet word of mouth and attendance at industry trade show to promote our brand to further promote our brand we may be required to change our marketing practice which could result in substantially increased advertising expense including the need to use traditional medium such television radio and print the automobile industry is intensely competitive and we may not be successful in building maintaining and strengthening our brand many of our current and potential competitor particularly automobile manufacturer headquartered in detroit japan and the european union have greater name recognition broader customer relationship and substantially greater marketing resource than we do if we do not develop and maintain strong brand our business prospect financial condition and operating result will be materially and adversely impacted if our vehicle owner customize our vehicle or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket product the vehicle may not operate properly which could harm our business automobile enthusiast may seek to hack our vehicle to modify it performance which could compromise vehicle safety system also we are aware of customer who have customized their vehicle with after market part that may compromise driver safety for example some customer have installed seat that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety system could be compromised other customer have changed wheel and tire while others have installed large speaker system that may impact the electrical system of the vehicle we have not tested do we endorse such change or product in addition customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlet can expose our customer to injury from high voltage electricity such unauthorized modification could reduce the safety of our vehicle and any injury resulting from such modification could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result our plan to expand our network of tesla store service center and supercharger will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet our expectation with respect to additional sale of our electric vehicle in addition we may not be able to open store or service center in certain state or supercharger in desired location our plan to expand our network of tesla store service center and supercharger will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet our expectation with respect to additional sale of our electric vehicle this ongoing global expansion may not have the desired effect of increasing sale and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore there can be no assurance that we will be able to expand on the budget or timeline we have established we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirement applicable to the sale and service of our vehicle in those jurisdiction which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delay in expanding our network of tesla store service center and supercharger this could lead to decrease in sale of our vehicle and could negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we have opened tesla store and service center in major metropolitan area throughout north america europe and asia and we plan to open additional store and service center worldwide to support our ongoing worldwide model rollout we have also rapidly expanded our supercharger network in the europe and china however we may not be able to expand at sufficient rate and our planned expansion will require significant cash investment and management resource well efficiency in the execution of establishing these location and in hiring and training the necessary employee to effectively sell and service our vehicle furthermore certain state and foreign jurisdiction may have permit requirement franchise dealer law or similar law or regulation that may preclude or restrict our ability to open store or sell vehicle out of such state and jurisdiction any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sale in such jurisdiction which could harm our business prospect and operating result see risk factor we may face regulatory limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicle additionally we may face potential difficulty in finding suitable supercharger site in desired location negotiating lease or obtaining required permit for such location we face risk associated with our international operation and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political tax and labor condition and establishing ourselves in new market all of which could harm our business we face various risk associated with our international operation and expansion we currently have international operation and subsidiary in various country and jurisdiction in europe and asia that are subject to the legal political regulatory and social requirement and economic condition in these jurisdiction additionally part of our growth strategy we will continue to expand our sale maintenance repair and supercharger service internationally particularly in china however we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicle internationally well limited experience installing and operating supercharger internationally and international expansion requires to make significant expenditure including the establishment of local operating entity hiring of local employee and establishing facility in advance of generating any revenue we are subject to number of risk associated with international business activity that may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our electric vehicle and require significant management attention these risk include conforming our vehicle to various international regulatory and safety requirement where our vehicle are sold or homologation difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operation difficulty attracting customer in new jurisdiction foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement including foreign tax that we may not be able to offset against tax imposed upon in the united state and foreign tax and other law limiting our ability to repatriate fund to the united state fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate including risk related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activity we undertake our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property right especially in those foreign country that do not respect and protect intellectual property right to the same extent do the united state japan and european country which increase the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our technology united state and foreign government trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control foreign labor law regulation and restriction preference of foreign nation for domestically produced vehicle change in diplomatic and trade relationship political instability natural disaster war or event of terrorism and the strength of international economy additionally we have expanded into new international market we have faced challenge with ensuring that our charging equipment work successfully with the charging infrastructure in such market for example we have encountered such challenge in norway and china if customer experience problem with the way our charging equipment work with the local charging infrastructure or we are unable to adapt our equipment to resolve such problem then the viability and acceptance of our vehicle in such market could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to successfully address these risk our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially harmed development in alternative technology or improvement in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicle significant development in alternative technology such advanced diesel ethanol hydrogen fuel cell or compressed natural gas or improvement in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine may materially and adversely affect our business and prospect in way we do not currently anticipate any failure by to develop new or enhanced technology or process or to react to change in existing technology could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicle which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicle decreased revenue and loss of market share to competitor the unavailability reduction or elimination of or uncertainty regarding government and economic incentive in the and abroad could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition operating result and prospect any reduction or elimination of government and economic incentive due to policy change the reduced need for such incentive the customer base of our electric vehicle expands fiscal tightening or other reason may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicle in particular such reduction or elimination of incentive could materially and adversely affect our growth well because our business prospect financial condition and operating result our growth depends in part on the availability and amount of government incentive for example we currently benefit from certain exemption in the united state such the california state sale and use tax similarly government program in europe favor the purchase of electric vehicle including through disincentive that discourage the use of gas powered vehicle in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicle is not currently subject to import tax tax on non recurring vehicle fee the value added tax or the purchase tax that apply to the purchase of gas powered vehicle if such government program are reduced or eliminated or the available benefit thereunder are exhausted earlier than anticipated sale of all electric vehicle including our model could be adversely affected in addition customer in certain market may delay taking delivery of their tesla vehicle if they believe that certain electric vehicle incentive will be available at later date which may negatively affect our ability to achieve our planned delivery target our strategic relationship with third party such panasonic are subject to various risk which could adversely affect our business and future prospect our strategic relationship third party such panasonic which supply with battery cell for use in model and model and is our partner in the gigafactory pose various risk to including potential loss of access to important technology and vehicle part potential loss of business and adverse publicity in addition these third party may not perform expected under our agreement with them such with respect to vehicle part quality of timeliness and we may have disagreement or dispute with these third party the occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business prospect financial condition and operating result the operation of our vehicle is different from internal combustion engine vehicle and our customer may experience difficulty operating them properly including difficulty transitioning between different method of braking we have designed our vehicle to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain in certain instance these protection may cause the vehicle to behave in way that are unfamiliar to driver of internal combustion vehicle for example we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery pack in most mode of vehicle operation our customer may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brake to slow the vehicle however when the vehicle is at maximum charge the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed by the vehicle accordingly our customer may have difficulty shifting between different method of braking in addition we use safety mechanism to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reach elevated temperature in such instance the vehicle acceleration and speed will decrease finally if the driver permit the battery pack to substantially deplete it charge the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains the vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to stop despite several warning about an imminent loss of charge the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected there can be no assurance that our customer will operate the vehicle properly especially in these situation any accident resulting from such failure to operate our vehicle properly could harm our brand and reputation result in adverse publicity and product liability claim and have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition if consumer dislike these feature they may choose not to buy additional car from which could also harm our business and prospect if we are unable to keep up with advance in electric vehicle technology we may suffer decline in our competitive position we may be unable to keep up with change in electric vehicle technology and result may suffer decline in our competitive position any failure to keep up with advance in electric vehicle technology would result in decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition our research and development effort may not be sufficient to adapt to change in electric vehicle technology technology change we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicle and introduce new model in order to continue to provide vehicle with the latest technology in particular battery cell technology however our vehicle may not compete effectively with alternative vehicle if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicle for example we do not currently manufacture battery cell which make dependent upon other supplier of battery cell technology for our battery pack if we are unable to attract and or retain key employee and hire qualified management technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel our ability to compete could be harmed and our stock price may decline the loss of the service of any of our key employee could disrupt our operation delay the development and introduction of our vehicle and service and negatively impact our business prospect and operating result well cause our stock price to decline in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect and chairman of our board of director and jb straubel our chief technical officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officer and other key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining member of our senior management team well technical vehicle engineering and manufacturing personnel due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive experience in addition we do not have key person life insurance policy covering any of our officer or other key employee currently in northern california there is increasing competition for talented individual with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicle software engineer manufacturing engineer and other skilled employee and this competition affect both our ability to retain key employee and hire new one our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employee in timely manner and retain current employee additionally we compete with many mature and prosperous company in northern california that have far greater financial resource than we do and thus can offer current or perspective employee more lucrative incentive package than we can any difficulty in retaining current employee or recruiting new one would have an adverse effect on our performance we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer product architect chairman of our board of director and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle and chairman of solarcity solar equipment installation company we are subject to various environmental and safety law and regulation that could impose substantial cost upon and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facility an automobile manufacturer we are subject to national state provincial and or local environmental health and safety law and regulation including law relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous material both in the united state and abroad environmental and health and safety law and regulation can be complex and we expect that our business and operation will be affected by new or future amendment to such law that may require to change our operation potentially resulting in material adverse effect on our business these law can give rise to liability for administrative oversight cost cleanup cost property damage bodily injury and associated fine and penalty capital and operating expense needed to comply with environmental health and safety law and regulation can be significant and violation of those law may result in substantial fine and penalty third party damage suspension of production or cessation of our operation these expense could have material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating result contamination at property formerly owned or operated by well at property we will own and operate and property to which hazardous substance were sent by may result in liability for under environmental law and regulation including but not limited to the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla the government can impose liability on under cercla for the full amount of remediation related cost of contaminated site without regard to fault such cost can include those associated with the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil ground water and building well to reverse impact to human health and damage to natural resource we may also face unexpected delay in obtaining the necessary permit and approval required by environmental law in connection with our manufacturing facility that could require significant time and financial resource and negatively impact our ability to operate these facility which would adversely impact our business prospect and operating result the owner of the tesla factory and surrounding land we may be responsible under federal and state law and regulation for the entire investigation and remediation of any environmental contamination at the tesla factory whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the property when tesla purchased the property the previous owner and operator of the tesla factory new united motor manufacturing inc nummi identified environmental condition at the tesla factory that could adversely affect soil and groundwater and agreed to remediate these condition although nummi stated that it fully documented and managed all environmental issue at the tesla factory we can not determine with certainty the truth of this statement nor the total cost to remediate any pre existing contamination that may eventually be found we have reached an agreement with nummi under which over ten year period we will pay the first million of any cost of any governmentally required remediation activity for contamination that existed prior to the closing of the purchase for any known or unknown environmental condition remediation activity and nummi ha agreed to pay the next million for such remediation activity our agreement provides in part that nummi will pay up to the first million on our behalf if such expense are incurred in the first four year of our agreement subject to our reimbursement of such cost on the fourth anniversary date of the closing on either the ten year anniversary of the closing or whenever million ha been spent on remediation activity whichever come first nummi liability to with respect to remediation activity cease and we are responsible for any and all environmental condition at the fremont site at that point in time we have agreed to indemnify defend and hold harmless nummi from all liability including attorney fee or any cost or penalty it may incur arising out of or in connection with any claim relating to environmental condition and we have released nummi for any known or unknown claim except for nummi obligation for representation and warranty under the agreement there are no assurance that nummi will perform it obligation under our agreement and nummi failure to perform would require to undertake these obligation at potentially significant cost such performance may also adversely affect the production capacity of and our ability to operate the tesla factory any remediation activity or other environmental condition at the fremont site could harm our operation and the future use and value of the fremont site and could delay our production plan for model our business may be adversely affected by union activity although none of our employee are currently represented by labor union it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employee at automobile company to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage our employee may join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory our automobile production facility in fremont california wa purchased from nummi prior employee of nummi were union member and our future work force at this facility may be inclined to vote in favor of forming labor union we also own and operate another component manufacturing facility in lathrop california furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such part supplier and trucking and freight company and work stoppage or strike organized by such union could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating result if work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicle and have material adverse effect on our business prospect operating result or financial condition the mere fact that our labor force could be unionized may harm our reputation in the eye of some investor and thereby negatively affect our stock price consequently the unionization of our labor force could negatively impact the company health we are subject to substantial regulation which is evolving and unfavorable change or failure by to comply with these regulation could substantially harm our business and operating result the production and sale of motor vehicle in general and specifically related to electric vehicle are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local law we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant cost in complying with these regulation regulation related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risk associated with change to these regulation in the united state the following are example of regulatory and statutory issue facing the imposition of carbon tax or the introduction of cap and trade system on electric utility could increase the cost of electricity increasingly stringent clean air act emission regulation affecting power plant used to generate electricity could increase the cost of electricity change to the regulation governing the assembly and transportation of lithium ion battery pack such the un recommendation of the safe transport of dangerous good model regulation or regulation adopted by the pipeline and hazardous material safety administration phmsa could increase the cost of lithium ion battery pack or restrict their transport the amendment or rescission of the federal law and regulation mandating increased fuel economy in the united state referred to the corporate average fuel economy cafe standard could reduce new business opportunity for our powertrain sale and development activity the amendment or rescission of federal greenhouse gas tailpipe emission regulation administered by epa under the authority of the clean air act could reduce new business opportunity for our powertrain sale and development activity the amendment or rescission of california zero emission vehicle zev regulation administered by the california air resource board under the california health safety code could reduce new business opportunity for our powertrain sale and development activity well our ability to monetize zev credit not only in california but also in the eleven additional state that have adopted the california program increased sensitivity by regulator to the need of established automobile manufacturer with large employment base high fixed cost and business model based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pas regulation that could reduce the compliance cost of such established manufacturer or mitigate the effect of government effort to promote alternative fuel vehicle change to the vehicle specific federal motor vehicle safety standard which govern how all motor vehicle are made within the united state could result in costly change to how current vehicle are produced and change to regulation governing the export of our product could increase our delivery cost to outside the united state or force to charge consumer in such jurisdiction higher price for our vehicle in addition the automotive industry move towards greater use of electronics in vehicle system nhtsa and other regulatory body may regulate these electronic system more stringently particularly concern about distracted driving increase such concern could affect use of electronic system in model such the inch display screen which could reduce the appeal of model or require adjustment to the display screen functionality we are currently delivering vehicle in europe and asia we are subject to law and regulation applicable to the import sale and service of automobile in those region for example we are required to meet vehicle specific safety standard that are often materially different from requirement thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance unlike in the where we self certify our vehicle compliance with standard we must obtain advanced approval from regulatory agency regarding the proper certification or homologation of our vehicle to enter into these market this process necessitates that foreign regulatory official review and certify our vehicle prior to market entry in addition we must comply with regulation applicable to vehicle after they enter the market including foreign reporting requirement and recall management system to the extent or international law change some or all of our vehicle may not comply with any new applicable international federal state or local law which would have an adverse effect on our business compliance with changing regulation could be burdensome time consuming and expensive to the extent compliance with new regulation is cost prohibitive our business prospect financial condition and operating result will be adversely affected we retain certain personal information about our customer and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection law our collection use retention security and transfer of personal information of our customer is subject to federal state and international law these law continue to be enacted and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction complying with changing international law may cause to incur substantial cost expose to legal liability or require to change our business practice our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by or our vendor or other business partner to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security law or regulation could result in regulatory or litigation related action against legal liability fine damage and other cost although we take step to protect the security of our customer personal information we may be required to expend significant resource to comply with data breach requirement if third party improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customer or we otherwise experience data loss with respect to customer personal information major breach of our network security and system could have serious negative consequence for our business and future prospect including possible fine penalty and damage reduced customer demand for our vehicle and harm to our reputation and brand we may be compelled to undertake product recall or take other action which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition we previously experienced product recall in may october and june none of which wa related to our electric powertrain in april we determined that condition caused by insufficient torqueing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our tesla roadster result of missed process during the manufacture of the tesla roadster glider in october we initiated product recall after the volt low voltage auxiliary cable in single vehicle chafed against the edge of carbon fiber panel in the vehicle causing short smoke and possible fire behind the right front headlamp of the vehicle in june we initiated recall of slightly more than one thousand model vehicle to inspect and repair rear seat striker that may have been compromised during the assembly process rear seat striker are used to retain the rear seat back in an upright position failure of this component may have resulted in collapse of the rear seat back during crash finally in january we implemented firmware update to address issue with certain universal mobile connector nema adapter which are part of the charging unit and are not part of the vehicle themselves potentially overheating during charging in the future we may at various time voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recall if any of our vehicle including model or our electric powertrain component prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable federal motor vehicle safety standard such recall voluntary or involuntary involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resource and could adversely affect our brand image in our target market well our business prospect financial condition and result of operation our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim which could adversely affect our financial performance if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our vehicle our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserve include management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future subject to separate limited warranty for the supplemental restraint system and battery we provide four year or mile new vehicle limited warranty for the purchaser of model the new vehicle limited warranty for model also cover the drive unit for eight year and the battery for period of eight year or mile or unlimited mile depending on the size of the vehicle battery although the battery charging capacity is not covered under the new vehicle limited warranty or any extended service plan in addition customer have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the new vehicle limited warranty for model to cover additional service for an additional four year or mile provided it is purchased within specified period of time the new vehicle limited warranty and extended service plan for the tesla roadster and model are subject to certain limitation exclusion or separate warranty including certain wear item such tire brake pad paint and general appearance and battery performance and is intended to cover part and labor to repair defect in material or workmanship in the vehicle including the body chassis suspension interior electronic system powertrain and brake system we have previously provided our tesla roadster customer with battery replacement option to replace the battery in their vehicle at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicle additionally in part of our ongoing effort to improve the customer ownership experience we expanded the battery pack warranty and also eliminated the annual service requirement that wa needed to keep the new vehicle limited warranty in effect should this change in warranty coverage lead to an increase in warranty claim we may need to record additional warranty reserve which would negatively affect our profitability our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage while we currently maintain general liability automobile property worker compensation and director and officer insurance policy general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due fluctuation in our operating cost and the seasonality of our business we expect our period to period operating result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will increase significantly in future period we among other thing design develop and manufacture model and future product increase the production capacity at our manufacturing facility to produce vehicle at higher volume develop the gigafactory open new tesla service center with maintenance and repair capability open new supercharger location increase our sale and marketing activity and increase our general and administrative function to support our growing operation result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our operating result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our operating result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst or investor if any of this occurs the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time additionally sale of new car in the automobile industry typically decline over the winter season and are generally higher during the spring and summer month we anticipate that our sale of model and future model may have similar seasonality but our limited operating history make it difficult for to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business our operating result could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectation for this seasonal demand because many of our expense are based on anticipated level of annual revenue unauthorized control or manipulation of our vehicle system may cause them to operate improperly or not at all or compromise their safety and data security which could result in loss of confidence in and our vehicle and harm our business there have been report of vehicle of other automobile manufacturer being hacked to grant access and operation of the vehicle to unauthorized person and would be thief our vehicle and in particular model are technologically advanced machine requiring the interoperation of numerous complex and evolving hardware and software system subject to our customer ability to opt out pursuant to our privacy policy model is designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update the functionality of these system although we have designed implemented and tested security measure to prevent unauthorized access to our vehicle and their system our information technology network and communication with our vehicle may be vulnerable to interception manipulation damage disruption or shutdown due to attack by hacker or breach due to error by personnel who have access to our network and system any such attack or breach could result in unexpected control of or change to our vehicle functionality user interface and performance characteristic hacker may also use similar mean to gain access to data stored in or generated by the vehicle such it current geographical position previous and stored destination address history and web browser favorite any such unauthorized control of vehicle or access to or loss of information could result in legal claim or proceeding and negative publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result the range and power of our electric vehicle on single charge decline over time and this may negatively influence potential customer decision whether to purchase our vehicle the range and power of our electric vehicle on single charge decline principally function of usage time and charging pattern well other factor how customer us their tesla vehicle the frequency of recharging the battery pack at low state of charge and the mean of charging can result in additional deterioration of the battery pack ability to hold charge over the long term for example we currently expect that our battery pack for the tesla roadster will retain approximately of it ability to hold it initial charge after approximately mile or seven year which will result in decrease to the vehicle initial range and power preliminary internal testing and customer result of model to date suggest that deterioration of the model battery pack to be le than the roadster however such battery pack deterioration and the related decrease in range and power over time well any perceived deterioration or fluctuation in range may negatively influence potential customer decision whether to purchase our vehicle which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicle we may need or want to raise additional fund and these fund may not be available to when we need them if we can not raise additional fund when we need or want them our operation and prospect could be negatively affected the design manufacture sale and servicing of automobile is capital intensive business we expect that our principal source of liquidity will provide adequate liquidity based on our current plan however until we are consistently generating positive free cash flow if the cost for developing and manufacturing model exceed our expectation or if we incur any significant unplanned expense or embark on or accelerate new significant strategic investment such the gigafactory we may need to raise additional fund through the issuance of equity equity related or debt security or through obtaining credit from government or financial institution this capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operation continue research and development project including those for our planned model crossover and model vehicle establish sale and service center build and deploy supercharger and to make the investment in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce model we can not be certain that additional fund will be available to on favorable term when required or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially adversely affected if we fail to effectively manage the residual financing and credit risk for our recently launched model leasing program our business may suffer we recently introduced leasing program in the united state and canada through our captive finance company tesla finance the profitability of the leasing program depends on our ability to accurately project residual value secure adequate financing and or business partner to fund and grow this program and manage customer credit risk if actual residual value of model vehicle are below our estimate we may suffer lower profitability or potentially have loss if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with either internal fund or external financing source we may be unable to grow our sale additionally if we do not properly screen customer for ability to pay their lease on time we may be exposed to excessive credit risk and associated loss furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the greater level of residual and credit risk resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with federal and state financial regulation and consumer protection law governing lease transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty either of which may harm our business any failure to execute on the daimler class ev program could hurt our reputation well our profitability on this program we have worked with daimler to develop full electric powertrain for daimler mercedes benz class ev vehicle we have substantially completed our development service under this class program and commenced production of electric powertrains and battery pack for daimler the supply agreement for these product contemplates customary obligation of such timely delivery warranty and product defect obligation if we fail to meet these obligation or if we exceed our current cost projection for producing these product our profitability on this program will suffer and this could have negative impact on our operating result we may face regulatory limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicle we sell our vehicle from our tesla store well over the internet we may not be able to sell our vehicle through this sale model in each state in the united state many state have law that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sale by manufacturer to resident of the state or to impose other limitation on this sale model including law that prohibit manufacturer from selling vehicle directly to consumer without the use of an independent dealership or without physical presence in the state in certain state in which we are not able to obtain dealer license we have worked with state regulator to open gallery which are location where potential customer can view our vehicle but are not full retail location it is possible that state regulator could later determine that the activity at our gallery constitute unlicensed sale of motor vehicle in many state the application of state motor vehicle law to our specific sale model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry law and is being determined by fact specific analysis of numerous factor including whether we have physical presence or employee in the applicable state whether we advertise or conduct other activity in the applicable state how the sale transaction is structured the volume of sale into the state and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturer from acting dealer result of the fact specific and largely untested nature of these issue and the fact that applying these law intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sale model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulator the manner in which the applicable authority are applying their state law to our distribution model continues to be difficult to predict law in some state have limited our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and may continue to do so in addition decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle may be subject to challenge to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law for example vehicle dealer association in new york ohio and massachusetts have filed lawsuit to revoke dealer license issued to these lawsuit have been dismissed and in one recent court decision the supreme court of massachusetts held that state franchise law like the one in massachusetts do not restrict manufacturer like tesla that doe not use franchised dealer from selling it vehicle directly to consumer such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state law were not designed to prevent our distribution model similar lawsuit have been filed in georgia and missouri possible additional challenge in other state if successful could restrict or prohibit our ability to sell our vehicle to resident in such state in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by vehicle dealer association to propose bill and regulation that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model such event recently occurred in new jersey where the motor vehicle commission at the behest of the local automobile dealer lobby passed new regulation which purported to invalidate our sale license in the state and in michigan where the state automobile dealer association managed to add language into an unrelated bill that had the effect of impairing our right to sell vehicle through tesla store in michigan we have brought lawsuit in new jersey to invalidate that regulation which we believe to be unlawful and we are evaluating legislative and litigation solution to remedy the situation in michigan other state such new york ohio and pennsylvania have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate we are also registered both motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in canada australia and japan and have obtained license to sell vehicle in other place such hong kong and china furthermore while we have performed an analysis of the principal law in the european union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such law we have not performed complete analysis in all foreign jurisdiction in which we may sell vehicle accordingly there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time we may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claim which may be time consuming and would cause to incur substantial cost company organization or individual including our competitor may hold or obtain patent trademark or other proprietary right that would prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our vehicle or component which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time we may receive communication from holder of patent or trademark regarding their proprietary right company holding patent or other intellectual property right may bring suit alleging infringement of such right or otherwise assert their right and urge to take license in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to do one or more of the following cease selling incorporating or using vehicle or offering good or service that incorporate or use the challenged intellectual property pay substantial damage obtain license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right which license may not be available on reasonable term or at all redesign our vehicle or other good or service or establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event of successful claim of infringement against and our failure or inability to obtain license to the infringed technology or other intellectual property right our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claim whether or not valid could result in substantial cost and diversion of resource and management attention we may also face claim that our use of technology licensed or otherwise obtained from third party infringes the right of others in such case we may seek indemnification from our licensors supplier under our contract with them however indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our cost and loss depending on our use of the technology whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation and other factor our patent application may not result in issued patent which may have material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from interfering with our commercialization of our product the status of patent involves complex legal and factual question and the breadth and effectiveness of patented claim is uncertain we can not be certain that we are the first creator of invention covered by pending patent application or the first to file patent application on these invention nor can we be certain that our pending patent application will result in issued patent or that any of our issued patent will afford sufficient protection against someone creating knockoff of our product or defense against competitor who claim that we are infringing it patent in addition patent application filed in foreign country are subject to law rule and procedure that differ from those of the united state and thus we can not be certain that foreign patent application related to issued patent will result in issued patent in those foreign jurisdiction in addition others may obtain patent that we need to license or design around either of which would increase cost and may adversely affect our business prospect financial condition and operating result our trademark application in certain country remain subject to outstanding opposition proceeding we currently sell and market our product and service in various country under our tesla mark we have filed trademark application for our tesla mark and opposition proceeding to trademark application of third party in various country in which we currently sell and plan to sell our product and service certain of our trademark application are subject to outstanding opposition proceeding brought by owner or applicant alleging prior application for or use of similar mark if we can not resolve these opposition and thereby secure registered right in these country our ability to challenge third party user of the tesla mark will be reduced and the value of the mark representing our exclusive brand name in these country will be diluted in addition there is risk that the prior right owner could in the future take action to challenge our use of the tesla mark in these country such action could have severe impact on our position in these country and may inhibit our ability to use the tesla mark in these country if we were prevented from using the tesla mark in any or all of these country we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resource on establishing an alternative brand identity in these market our facility or operation could be damaged or adversely affected result of disaster or unpredictable event our corporate headquarters in palo alto tesla factory in fremont and additional component manufacturing facility in lathrop are located in northern california region known for seismic activity if major disaster such earthquake fire flood hurricane war terrorist attack computer virus pandemic or other event occur or our information system or communication network break down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product in addition our lease for our palo alto facility permit the landlord to terminate the lease following casualty event if the needed repair are in excess of certain threshold and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amount we may incur expense relating to such damage which could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition if our supplier fail to use ethical business practice and comply with applicable law and regulation our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity our core value which include developing the highest quality electric vehicle while operating with integrity are an important component of our brand image which make our reputation particularly sensitive to allegation of unethical business practice we do not control our independent supplier or their business practice accordingly we can not guarantee their compliance with ethical business practice such environmental responsibility fair wage practice appropriate sourcing of raw material and compliance with child labor law among others lack of demonstrated compliance could lead to seek alternative supplier which could increase our cost and result in delayed delivery of our product product shortage or other disruption of our operation violation of labor or other law by our supplier or the divergence of an independent supplier labor or other practice from those generally accepted ethical in the united state or other market in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for and our brand this could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicle if result of such violation we were to attract negative publicity if we or other manufacturer in our industry encounter similar problem in the future it could harm our brand image business prospect financial condition and operating result servicing our convertible senior note requires significant amount of cash and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt we incurred million million and billion respectively in aggregate principal amount of senior indebtedness when we issued pursuant to registered public offering convertible senior note due note in and convertible senior note due note and convertible senior note due note in our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal when due to make quarterly interest payment or to make payment upon conversion or to refinance the note depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under the note and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance the note or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time we may not be able to engage in any of these activity or engage in these activity on desirable term which could result in default on the note or future indebtedness pursuant to their term holder may convert their note at their option at any time prior to the final three month period of the scheduled term of the respective note only under certain circumstance for example holder may generally convert their note at their option during quarter and only during such quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of in the case of the note and the third quarter of in the case of the note and the note if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading day whether or not consecutive during period of consecutive trading day ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price for such series of note on each applicable trading day result of this conversion feature the note have been convertible at their holder option during each quarter commencing with the fourth quarter of except the first quarter of neither this nor any other conversion feature ha been met with respect to the note and note and consequently the note and have not been convertible at their holder option upon conversion of the note we will be obligated to make cash payment in respect of the principal amount thereof and we may also have to deliver cash and if applicable share of our common stock in respect of such note any conversion of the note prior to their maturity or acceleration of the repayment of the note or future indebtedness after any applicable notice or grace period could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition in addition holder of the note will have the right to require to purchase their note upon the occurrence of fundamental change at purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the note plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date however we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make purchase of note surrendered therefor or note being converted in addition our ability to purchase the note or to pay cash upon conversion of the note may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness our failure to purchase note at time when the purchase is required by the indenture or to pay cash payable on future conversion of the note required by the indenture would constitute default under the indenture if the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace period we may not have sufficient fund to repay the indebtedness and purchase the note or make cash payment upon conversion thereof we may still incur substantially more debt or take other action which would intensify the risk discussed we and our subsidiary are not restricted

conjunction with our consolidated financial statement and the related note that appear elsewhere in this annual report on form overview and highlight we design develop manufacture and sell high performance fully electric vehicle advanced electric vehicle powertrain component and stationary energy storage application we are currently producing and selling our second vehicle the model sedan model is four door five passenger premium sedan that offer exceptional performance functionality and attractive styling the model inherited many of the electric powertrain innovation we introduced with our first vehicle the tesla roadster we commenced delivery of model in june and have delivered vehicle through december we recently announced the availability of our all wheel drive dual motor model and began delivery starting with performance optimized version in december we are continuing to develop our model crossover vehicle and intend to commence customer delivery in the third quarter of after the model our goal is to introduce model lower priced sedan designed for the mass market in our primary source of revenue is from the sale of our vehicle during the year ended december we recognized total revenue of billion an increase of billion over total revenue of billion for the year ended december primarily driven by growth of model delivery worldwide gross margin for the year ended december wa significant increase from for the year ended december higher vehicle production volume supply chain efficiency and component cost reduction partially offset by one time manufacturing inefficiency associated with transitioning to our new final assembly line and introduction of all wheel drive dual motor model contributed to higher gross margin in research and development expense for the year ended december were million an increase from million for the year ended december expense in reflected our engineering work on model well development work on our dual motor powertrain and other development program including localization effort for foreign market expense in reflected our activity on manufacturing process improvement model cost reduction the right hand drive model and localization effort for foreign market well development work on model during we significantly increased our sale and service footprint worldwide entered several new market including china well accelerated the rollout of our supercharging network with the continued global expansion of our customer support infrastructure and the business in general in selling general and administrative expense were million for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december management opportunity challenge and risk order production and delivery our order for model in significantly increased from the prior year we expanded our operation internationally and introduced model product enhancement in october we revealed our all wheel drive dual motor model and our autopilot system this version of model proved very popular leading to over unfulfilled order of january we expect that demand for model will continue to increase worldwide more people drive and become aware of our vehicle we grow our customer support infrastructure and we broaden the appeal of our product of december we had received almost reservation for model in advance of it planned introduction later this year we are continuing to test the beta model prototype and plan to begin building and testing small fleet of release candidate model vehicle later in the first quarter of our ability to launch the model program on time and cost efficiently is dependent upon variety of factor including completion of production tooling supplier readiness engineering completion and the successful completion of our validation testing in order to meet this anticipated demand for both model and model we are executing plan to increase our combined model and model production capacity to over unit per week by the end of in august we began our production ramp by transitioning to our new final assembly line and upgrading our body center we are planning further investment in production capacity during including building new paint shop and new body shop for model we expect our annual production will increase by over each year for the next several year our recent production capacity expansion contributed to several week of production in excess of vehicle per week during the last few month of however the changeover to our new final assembly line during the third quarter of and the introduction of all wheel drive dual motor model onto this line during the fourth quarter of took longer than we expected consequently we delivered fewer vehicle than we had planned in during we plan to achieve significant efficiency in model production and begin production of model with the intent of achieving significantly faster initial production ramp than we achieved with model any unexpected issue with the expansion of our production capacity or the launch and ramp of model production could affect our ability to meet future delivery target in addition to expanding our production we expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicle and improve our gross margin significant cost improvement for model were achieved in and including part cost reduction well manufacturing efficiency we expect that this trend will continue we execute on our roadmap we expect that such improvement when combined with favorable mix of vehicle will allow to achieve gross margin on model by the end of assuming no further deterioration in foreign currency however we expect these cost improvement will be partially offset by production inefficiency during the introduction of model during our product introduction in we incurred manufacturing inefficiency which negatively impacted our gross margin when we introduce model we expect that both production inefficiency and supply chain inefficiency typical of new product introduction will suppress model margin for at least few quarter after it introduction if we are not able to achieve the planned cost reduction from our various cost saving and process improvement initiative or introduce model efficiently our ability to reach our gross margin goal would be negatively affected we expect to deliver approximately model and vehicle worldwide in approximately more delivery than we achieved in to support this growth we plan to continue to expand our supercharger store and service infrastructure worldwide well to provide better service in area with high concentration of model customer we now offer model in country throughout north america europe and asia our expansion will primarily occur in geographic area in which we already have presence based on our current projection we expect our long term sale outside of north america will increase to almost half of our worldwide automotive sale despite initial challenge in china we plan to continue to invest in our infrastructure in china we believe that the country could be one of our largest market within few year however compared to market in the united state and europe we have relatively limited experience in asian market thus we may face continuing difficulty meeting our future expansion plan in asia trend in capital expenditure and operating expense our capital expenditure and operating expense significantly increased in we continue to invest in the long term growth of tesla capital spending and operating expense will continue to increase but at more moderate pace than in during capital expenditure are expected to be about billion we expand production capacity complete model development and invest in the gigafactory our store and service center we also plan to grow our supercharger network by over this year well continue other product development program including model our operating expense will continue to grow in but at le than half the pace of growth in or approximately to annualized our expense in particular will continue to increase we complete the development validation and testing of model and accelerate design and engineering work on model growth of sale general and administrative expense will be more modest we will be particularly focused on increasing operational efficiency while we continue to expand our customer and corporate infrastructure over time we expect overall operating expense to decrease percentage of revenue of december and the net book value of our supercharger network wa million and million and currently includes location globally we plan to continue investing in our supercharger network for the foreseeable future including in north america europe and asia and expect such spending to be approximately of total capital spending over the next month we allocate supercharger related expense to cost of revenue automotive sale and selling general and administrative expense these cost were immaterial for all period presented customer financing option we offer loan and lease in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution in we began offering resale value guarantee in connection with certain loan offered by financial institution and have since provided this guarantee to approximately model customer model delivery with the resale value guarantee currently do not impact our cash flow and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sale price at delivery however this program requires the deferral of revenue and cost into future period under lease accounting although lease accounting will continue to impact our revenue and operating result this and similar program initially ramp up time pass the amortization of existing deferred revenue and cost will begin to partially offset this adverse impact furthermore while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer we are exposed to the risk that the vehicle resale value may be lower than our estimate and the volume of vehicle returned to may be higher than our estimate which could adversely impact our gross margin we currently offer lease in the directly from tesla finance our captive financing entity well through bank partner leasing through tesla finance is now available in state the district of columbia and in province of canada we leased approximately vehicle through tesla finance during and about approximately vehicle through our banking partner leasing through both tesla finance and our banking partner expose to residual value risk and will adversely impact our near term revenue and operating result by requiring the deferral of revenue and cost into future period under lease accounting in addition for lease offered directly from tesla finance but not for those offered through our bank partner we will not receive the full amount of the cash for the vehicle price at delivery and will assume customer credit risk we expect to increase our leasing activity during we have set the residual value given to our customer under our resale value guarantee program at what we estimate will be the trade in value of these vehicle at the end of the term of the option based on current market demand for our car we estimate the resale price for our vehicle will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amount should market value or customer demand decrease these estimate may be impacted materially the tesla gigafactory we are developing the tesla gigafactory facility where we intend to work together with our supplier to integrate battery precursor material cell module and battery pack production in one location in june we broke ground on the gigafactory outside of reno nevada construction continued during the end of at an accelerated pace with first cell expected to be produced in for use in model and model while our plan is to produce lithium ion cell and finished battery pack at the gigafactory our plan for such production are at very early stage we have no experience in the production of lithium ion cell and accordingly we intend to engage partner with significant experience in cell production we recently formalized our agreement with panasonic to partner on the gigafactory panasonic will invest in production equipment that it will use to manufacture and supply with battery cell we will prepare and provide the land building and utility for the gigafactory invest in production equipment for battery module and pack production and be responsible for the overall management of the gigafactory we anticipate bringing on additional partner for the gigafactory to create fully integrated industrial complex although planning discussion with production and supply chain partner continue to progress well to date we have not formalized any agreement with any other partner in addition the cost of building and operating the gigafactory could exceed our current expectation and the gigafactory may take longer to bring online than we anticipate critical accounting policy and estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance change in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual result could differ significantly from the estimate made by our management we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material difference between these estimate and actual result our future financial statement presentation financial condition result of operation and cash flow will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policy involve greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policy accordingly these are the policy we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and result of operation revenue recognition automotive sale we recognize automotive sale revenue from sale of model including vehicle option accessory and destination charge vehicle service and sale of regulatory credit such zev and greenhouse gas emission ghg credit we also recognize automotive sale revenue from the sale of electric vehicle powertrain component and system such battery pack and drive unit to other manufacturer revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists ii delivery ha occurred and there are no uncertainty regarding customer acceptance iii fee are fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured car sale include certain standard feature and customer selected option and configuration that meet the definition of deliverable under multiple element accounting guidance including internet connectivity supercharging access and specified software update for car equipped with autopilot hardware these deliverable are valued on stand alone basis and we recognize their related revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight year life of the car or for software upgrade they are delivered if we sell derivable separately we use that pricing to determine it fair value otherwise we use our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar option cost used to develop and deliver the service and other information which may be available resale value guarantee we offer resale value guarantee program to customer who purchase model and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial banking partner in the canada and europe under this program model customer have the option of selling their vehicle back to during the period from to month after delivery for specified value determined at time of purchase because we offer resale value guarantee we account for these transaction operating lease accordingly we recognize revenue attributable to the lease on straight line basis over the guarantee period to automotive sale revenue similarly we capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate it value le expected salvage value to cost of automotive sale over the same period at the end of the guarantee period which is the earlier of month or the pay date of the initial loan the resale value guarantee and deferred revenue balance are settled to automotive sale revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive sale if our customer retains ownership of the car in case where customer return the vehicle back to between month and we issue check to the customer in the amount of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance to automotive sale revenue at least annually we ass the estimated market value of vehicle under our resale value guarantee program we accumulate more data related to the resale value of model there may be significant change to their estimated value maintenance and service plan we offer prepaid maintenance program for model which includes plan covering maintenance for up to eight year or up to mile provided these service are purchased within specified period of time the maintenance plan cover annual inspection and the replacement of wear and tear part excluding tire and the battery with either fixed fee per visit for tesla ranger service or unlimited tesla ranger visit for higher initial purchase price payment collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sale we fulfill our performance obligation we also offer an extended service plan which cover the repair or replacement of model part for an additional four year or up to an additional mile after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty provided they are purchased within specified period of time for customer that are not covered by our new vehicle limited warranty or our extended service plan we offer tesla ranger service at higher cost payment collected in advance of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sale ratably over the service coverage period we provided tesla roadster customer with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial new vehicle limited warranty to cover additional service for an additional three year or mile we refer to this program our extended service plan amount collected on these sale are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sale over the extended warranty period additionally we have previously provided customer of our tesla roadster with one time option to replace the battery pack in their vehicle at any time after the expiration of the new vehicle limited warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicle we refer to this program our battery replacement program amount collected on these sale are initially recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized in automotive sale we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery pack inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis we record inventory write down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumption about future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change material change to these reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide warranty on all vehicle production powertrain component and system sale and we accrue warranty reserve upon delivery to customer warranty reserve include management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace any item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim we review our reserve at least quarterly to ensure that our accrual are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligation and we will adjust our estimate needed these estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future the portion of the warranty provision expected to be incurred within month is classified current within accrued liability while the remaining amount is classified long term within other long term liability during the third quarter of we extended the warranty on our model drive unit to eight year from four and reassessed our overall powertrain and vehicle warranty reserve which resulted in an additional charge of approximately million our warranty reserve do not include projected warranty cost associated with our operating lease vehicle including those sold with resale value or similar guarantee term in such case actual warranty cost are expensed incurred and are recorded component of cost of revenue valuation of stock based award stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and our employee stock purchase plan espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option and espp are estimated on the grant date and offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of estimated forfeiture the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility further the forfeiture rate also affect the amount of aggregate compensation these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment we estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeiture experience and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factor quarterly change in the estimated forfeiture rate can have significant effect on reported stock based compensation expense the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed if revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in decrease to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement if revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statement we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility expected life and forfeiture rate which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of revenue research and development expense and

for his service to the company income tax we record our provision for income tax in our consolidated statement of operation by estimating our tax in each of the jurisdiction in which we operate we estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary difference arising from differing treatment of item recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purpose in general deferred tax asset represent future tax benefit to be received when certain expense previously recognized in our consolidated statement of operation become deductible expense under applicable income tax law or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized valuation allowance are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the united state and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or material change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made result of operation revenue automotive sale automotive sale which include vehicle option and related sale and powertrain component and related sale consisted

to the doe to purchase up to share of our series convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of per share upon the completion of our initial public offering on july this preferred stock warrant became warrant to purchase up to share of common stock at an exercise price of per share since the number of share ultimately issuable under the warrant would vary depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period and decision to prepay would be influenced by our future stock price well the interest rate on our loan in relation to market interest rate we had historically measured the fair value of the warrant using monte carlo simulation approach the monte carlo approach simulates and capture the optimal decision to be made between prepaying the doe loan and the cancellation of the doe warrant for the purpose of the simulation the optimal decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to the total warrant value would then be calculated the average warrant payoff across all simulated path discounted to our valuation date the prepayment feature which allowed to prepay the doe loan facility and consequently affected the number of share ultimately issuable under the doe warrant wa determined to represent an embedded derivative this embedded derivative wa inherently valued and accounted for part of the warrant liability on our consolidated balance sheet change to the fair value of the embedded derivative were reflected part of the warrant liability re measurement to fair value at each balance sheet reporting date the warrant wa recorded at it estimated fair value with change in it fair value reflected in other income expense net until it expiration or vesting of december the fair value of the

expected life given our limited history with employee grant we use the simplified method in estimating the expected term for our employee grant the simplified method permitted by the sec is calculated the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the option our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility on publicly traded option of our common stock and the historical volatility of several unrelated public company within industry related to our business including the automotive oem automotive retail automotive part and battery technology industry because we have limited trading history on our common stock when making the selection of our peer company within industry related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation we also considered
