those described which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result risk specific to our companywe generate significant portion of our revenue from advertising and reduced spending by advertiser loss of partner or new and existing technology that block ad online and or affect our ability to customize ad could harm our business we generated over of total revenue from the display of ad online in many of our advertiser company that distribute our product and service digital publisher and content provider can terminate their contract with at any time these partner may not continue to do business with if we do not create more value such increased number of user or customer new sale lead increased brand awareness or more effective monetization than their available alternative change to our advertising policy and data privacy practice well change to other company advertising policy or practice may affect the advertising that we are able to provide which could harm our business in addition technology have been developed that make customized ad more difficult or that block the display of ad altogether and some provider of online service have integrated technology that could potentially impair the availability and functionality of third party digital advertising failing to provide superior value or deliver advertisement effectively and competitively could harm our reputation financial condition and operating result in addition expenditure by advertiser tend to be cyclical reflecting overall economic condition and budgeting and buying pattern adverse macroeconomic condition can also have material negative effect on the demand for advertising and cause our advertiser to reduce the amount they spend on advertising which could harm our financial condition and operating result we face intense competition if we do not continue to innovate and provide product and service that are useful to user we may not remain competitive which could harm our business and operating result our business environment is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive our business face changing technology shifting user need and frequent introduction of rival product and service to compete successfully we must accurately anticipate technology development and deliver innovative relevant and useful product service and technology in timely manner our business evolve the competitive pressure to innovate will encompass wider range of product and service we must continue to invest significant resource in research and development including through acquisition in order to enhance our technology and new and existing product and service we have many competitor in different industry our current and potential domestic and international competitor range from large and established company to emerging start ups some competitor have longer operating history in various sector they can use their experience and resource in way that could affect our competitive position including by making acquisition continuing to invest heavily in research and development and in talent aggressively initiating intellectual property claim whether or not meritorious and continuing to compete aggressively for user advertiser customer and content provider our competitor may be able to innovate and provide product and service faster than we can or may foresee the need for product and service before for example we are investing significantly in subscription based product and service such youtube which face intense competition from large experienced company with well established relationship with user our operating result may also suffer if our product and service are not responsive to the need of our user advertiser publisher customer and content provider technology continue to develop our competitor may be able to offer experience that are or that are seen to be substantially similar to or better than ours this may force to compete in different way and expend significant resource in order to remain competitive if our competitor of contentsalphabet inc are more successful than we are in developing compelling product or in attracting and retaining user advertiser publisher customer and content provider our operating result could be harmed our ongoing investment in new business product service and technology is inherently risky and could disrupt our current operation and harm our financial condition and operating result we have invested and expect to continue to invest in new business product service and technology the investment that we are making across google and other bet reflect our ongoing effort to innovate and provide product and service that are useful to user advertiser publisher customer and content provider our investment in google and other bet span wide range of industry beyond online advertising such investment ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital and in pursuing new strategy we may incur unanticipated liability these endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty including diversion of management resource and with respect to other bet the use of alternative investment governance or compensation structure that may fail to adequately align incentive across the company or otherwise accomplish their objective within google we continue to invest heavily in hardware including our smartphones and home device which is highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new product and service rapid adoption of technological advancement by competitor short product life cycle evolving industry standard continual improvement in product price and performance characteristic and price and feature sensitivity on the part of consumer and business there can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively we are also devoting significant resource to develop and deploy our enterprise ready cloud service including google cloud platform and suite we are incurring cost to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing service and hire talent particularly to support and scale the cloud salesforce at the time our competitor are rapidly developing and deploying cloud based service pricing and delivery model are competitive and evolving and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objective within other bet we are investing significantly in the area of health life science and transportation among others these investment area face intense competition from large experienced and well funded competitor and our offering may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient level of profitability in addition new and evolving product and service including those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning raise ethical technological legal regulatory and other challenge which may negatively affect our brand and demand for our product and service because all of these new venture are inherently risky no assurance can be given that such strategy and offering will be successful and will not harm our reputation financial condition and operating result our revenue growth rate could decline over time and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future our revenue growth rate could decline over time result of number of factor including increasing competition and the continued expansion of our business into variety of new field change in device mix geographic mix ongoing product and policy change product mix and property mix and an increasing competition for advertising may also affect our advertising revenue growth rate we may also experience decline in our revenue growth rate our revenue increase to higher level if there is decrease in the rate of adoption of our product service and technology or due to deceleration or decline in demand for device used to access our service among other factor in addition to decline in our revenue growth rate we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from variety of factor such the continued expansion of our business into new field including product and service such hardware google cloud google play gaming and subscription product well significant investment in other bet all of which may have margin lower than those we generate from advertising we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin from increasing competition and increased cost for many aspect of our business including within advertising where change such device mix property mix and partner agreement can affect margin the margin we earn on revenue generated from our google network member could also decrease in the future if we pay larger percentage of advertising fee to them we may also pay increased tac to our distribution partner well increased content acquisition cost to content provider we may also face an increase in infrastructure cost supporting business such search google cloud and youtube additionally our spend to promote new product and service or distribute certain product and service or increased investment in our innovation effort across google and our other bet business may affect our operating margin due to these factor and the evolving nature of our business our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance of contentsalphabet inc our intellectual property right are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our product service and brand well affect our ability to compete our patent trademark trade secret copyright and other intellectual property right are important asset for various event outside of our control pose threat to our intellectual property right well to our product service and technology for example effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our product and service are distributed or made available through the internet also the effort we have taken to protect our proprietary right may not be sufficient or effective although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovation it is possible we may not be able to protect some of these innovation moreover we may not have adequate patent or copyright protection for certain innovation that later turn out to be important furthermore there is always the possibility despite our effort that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable we also seek to maintain certain intellectual property trade secret the secrecy of such trade secret and other sensitive information could be compromised which could cause to lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secret we also face risk associated with our trademark for example there is risk that the word google could become so commonly used that it becomes synonymous with the word search some court have ruled that google is protectable trademark but it is possible that other court particularly those outside of the united state may reach different determination if this happens we could lose protection for this trademark which could result in other people using the word google to refer to their own product thus diminishing our brand any significant impairment of our intellectual property right could harm our business and our ability to compete also protecting our intellectual property right is costly and time consuming any increase in the unauthorized use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating result our business depends on strong brand and failing to maintain and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to expand our base of user advertiser customer content provider and other partner our strong brand have significantly contributed to the success of our business maintaining and enhancing the brand within google and other bet increase our ability to enter new category and launch new and innovative product that better serve the need of our user advertiser customer content provider and other partner our brand may be negatively affected by number of factor including among others reputational issue third party content shared on our platform data privacy and security issue and development and product or technical performance failure for example if we fail to appropriately respond to the sharing of misinformation or objectionable content on our service or objectionable practice by advertiser or to otherwise adequately address user concern our user may lose confidence in our brand our brand may also be negatively affected by the use of our product or service to disseminate information that is deemed to be false or misleading furthermore failure to maintain and enhance equity in our brand may harm our business financial condition and operating result our success will depend largely on our ability to remain technology leader and continue to provide high quality innovative product and service that are truly useful and play valuable role in range of setting we face number of manufacturing and supply chain risk that if not properly managed could harm our financial condition operating result and prospect we face number of risk related to manufacturing and supply chain management which could affect our ability to supply both our product and our internet based service we rely on other company to manufacture many of our assembly and finished product to design certain of our component and part and to participate in the distribution of our product and service our business could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage these company with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of our arrangement with them we may experience supply shortage and price increase driven by raw material availability manufacturing capacity labor shortage industry allocation tariff trade dispute and barrier natural disaster the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding wildfire and increased storm severity and significant change in the financial or business condition of our supplier we may experience shortage or other supply chain disruption that could negatively affect our operation in addition some of the component we use in our technical infrastructure and product are available only from single source or limited source and we may not be able to find replacement vendor on favorable term in the event of supply chain disruption in addition significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrade or expansion of contentsalphabet inc we may enter into long term contract for material and product that commit to significant term and condition we may be liable for material and product that are not consumed due to market acceptance technological change obsolescence quality product recall and warranty issue for instance because many of our hardware supply contract have volume based pricing or minimum purchase requirement if the volume of our hardware sale decrease or not reach projected target we could face increased material and manufacturing cost or other financial liability that could make our product more costly per unit to manufacture and negatively affect our financial result furthermore certain of our competitor may negotiate more favorable contractual term based on volume and other commitment that may provide them with competitive advantage and may affect our supply our product and service may have quality issue resulting from design manufacturing or operation sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other manufacturer or supplier if the quality of our product and service doe not meet expectation or our product or service are defective it could harm our reputation financial condition and operating result we require our supplier and business partner to comply with law and where applicable our company policy such the google supplier code of conduct regarding workplace and employment practice data security environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing but we do not control them or their practice violation of law or unethical business practice could result in supply chain disruption canceled order harm to key relationship and damage to our reputation their failure to procure necessary license right to

contract depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communication system our system are vulnerable to damage interference or interruption from terrorist attack natural disaster the effect of climate change such sea level rise drought flooding wildfire and increased storm severity power loss telecommunication failure computer virus ransomware attack computer denial of service attack phishing scheme or other attempt to harm or access our system some of our data center are located in area with high risk of major earthquake or other natural disaster our data center are also subject to break in sabotage and intentional act of vandalism and in some case to potential disruption resulting from problem experienced by facility operator some of our system are not fully redundant and disaster recovery planning can not account for all eventuality the occurrence of natural disaster closure of facility or other unanticipated problem at our data center could result in lengthy interruption in our service in addition our product and service are highly technical and complex and may contain error or vulnerability which could result in interruption in or failure of our service or system in addition we rely extensively on information system and technology to manage our business and summarize operating result we are in the process of multi year implementation of new erp system which will replace much of our existing core financial system the erp system is designed to accurately maintain our financial record enhance the flow of financial information improve data management and provide timely information to our management team we may not be able to successfully implement the erp system without experiencing delay increased cost and other difficulty failure to successfully design and implement the new erp system planned could harm our business financial condition and operating result additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system planned or the erp system doe not operate intended the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be negatively affected our international operation expose to additional risk that could harm our business our financial condition and operating result our international operation are significant to our revenue and net income and we plan to continue to grow internationally international revenue accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue in in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international operation expose to other risk including the following restriction on foreign ownership and investment and stringent foreign exchange control that might prevent from repatriating cash earned in country outside the of contentsalphabet inc import and export requirement tariff trade dispute and barrier and custom classification that may prevent from offering product or providing service to particular market or that could limit our ability to source assembly and finished product from particular market and may increase our operating cost longer payment cycle in some country increased credit risk and higher level of payment fraud evolving foreign event including brexit the united kingdom withdrawal from the european union eu brexit may adversely affect our revenue and could subject to new regulatory cost and challenge including the transfer of personal data the eu and the united kingdom in addition to other adverse effect that we are unable to effectively anticipate anti corruption law such the foreign corrupt practice act and other local law prohibiting certain payment to government official violation of which could result in civil and criminal penalty uncertainty regarding liability for service and content including uncertainty result of local law and lack of legal precedent different employee employer relationship existence of work council and labor union and other challenge caused by distance language and cultural difference making it harder to do business in certain jurisdiction because we conduct business in currency other than dollar but report our financial result in dollar we face exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate although we hedge portion of our international currency exposure significant fluctuation in exchange rate between the dollar and foreign currency may adversely affect our revenue and earnings hedging program are also inherently risky and could expose to additional risk that could harm our financial condition and operating result risk related to our industrypeople

their device in addition search query are increasingly being undertaken via voice activated speaker apps social medium or other platform which could harm our business it is hard to predict the challenge we may encounter in adapting our product and service and developing competitive new product and service we expect to continue to devote significant resource to creating and supporting product and service across multiple platform and device failing to attract and retain substantial number of new device manufacturer supplier distributor developer and user or failing to develop product and technology that work well on new device and platform could harm our business financial condition and operating result and ability to capture future business opportunity data privacy and

otherwise generate traffic that doe not represent genuine user interest or intent while we invest significantly in effort to promote high quality and relevant result and to detect and prevent low quality content and invalid traffic we may be unable to adequately detect and prevent such abuse many website violate or attempt to violate our guideline including by seeking to inappropriately rank higher in search result than our search engine assessment of their relevance and utility would rank them such effort known web spam may affect the quality of content on our platform and lead them to display false misleading or undesirable content although english language web spam in our search result ha been reduced and web spam in most other language is limited we expect web spammer will continue to seek inappropriate way to improve their ranking we continuously combat web spam in our search result including through indexing technology that make it harder for spam like le useful web content to rank highly we also continue to invest in and deploy proprietary technology to detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platform we also face other challenge from low quality and irrelevant content website including content farm which are website that generate large quantity of low quality content to help them improve their search ranking we are continually launching

attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight of contentsalphabet inc our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by and our user internet access provider may be able to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service which could lead to additional expense and the loss of user and advertiser our product and service depend on the ability of our user to access the internet and certain of our product require significant bandwidth to work effectively currently this access is provided by company that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace including incumbent telephone company cable company mobile communication company and government owned service provider some of these provider have taken or have stated that they may take measure that could degrade disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our product by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offering or by charging increased fee to or our user to provide our offering some jurisdiction have adopted regulation prohibiting certain form of discrimination by internet access provider however substantial uncertainty exists in the united state and elsewhere regarding such protection for example in the united state federal communication commission repealed net neutrality rule which could lead internet access provider to restrict block degrade or charge for access to certain of our product and service in addition in some jurisdiction our product and service have been subject to government initiated restriction or blockage such interference could result in loss of existing user customer and advertiser goodwill and increased cost and could impair our ability to attract new user customer and advertiser thereby harming our business risk related to law and regulation we are subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny well change in public policy governing wide range of topic that may negatively affect our business we and other company in the technology industry are experiencing increased regulatory scrutiny for instance various regulatory agency including competition consumer protection and privacy authority are reviewing aspect of our product and service we continue to cooperate with these investigation prior existing and new investigation have in the past and may in the future result in substantial fine and penalty change to our product and service alteration to our business operation and civil litigation all of which could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result change in international and local social political economic tax and regulatory condition or in law and policy governing wide range of topic may increase our cost of doing business limit our ability to pursue certain business model or offer certain product or service and cause to change our business practice further our

variety of new and existing law and or interpretation could harm our business we are subject to numerous and foreign law and regulation covering wide variety of subject matter new law and regulation or new interpretation or application of existing law and regulation in manner inconsistent with our practice may make our product and service le useful limit our ability to pursue certain business model or offer certain product and service require to incur substantial cost expose to unanticipated civil or criminal liability or cause to change our business practice these law and regulation are evolving and involve matter central to our business including among others competition law and regulation around the world privacy law such the california consumer privacy act of that came into effect in january of which give new data privacy right to california resident and sb in california which regulates the security of data in connection with internet connected device data protection law passed by many state within the and by certain country regarding notification to data subject and or regulator when there is security breach of personal data copyright law such the eu directive on copyright in the digital single market eucd of april which increase the liability of content sharing service with respect to content uploaded by their user it ha also created new property right in news publication that will limit the ability of some online service to interact with or present such content each eu member state must implement the eucd by june in addition there are new constraining licensing regime that limit our ability to operate with respect to copyright protected work data localization law which generally mandate that certain type of data collected in particular country be stored and or processed within that country of contentsalphabet inc various and international law that govern the distribution of certain material to child and regulate the ability of online service to collect information from minor various law with regard to content removal and disclosure obligation such the network enforcement act in germany which may affect our business and operation and may subject to significant fine if such law are interpreted and applied in manner inconsistent with our practice or when we may not proactively discover such content due to the scale of third party content and the limitation of existing technology other country including singapore australia and the united kingdom have implemented or are considering similar legislation imposing penalty for failure to remove certain type of content in addition the applicability and scope of these law interpreted by the court remain uncertain and could harm our business for example we rely on statutory safe harbor set forth in the digital millennium copyright act in the united state and the commerce directive in europe against copyright liability for various linking caching and hosting activity any legislation or court ruling affecting these safe harbor may adversely affect court decision such the judgment of the court of justice of the european union cjeu on may on the right to be forgotten which allows individual to demand that google remove search result about them in certain instance may limit the content we can show to our user and impose significant operational burden court decision that require google to remove link not just in the jurisdiction of the issuing court but for all version of the search engine worldwide including in location where the content at issue is lawful may limit the content we can show to our user and impose significant operational burden the supreme court of canada issued such decision against google in june and others could treat it decision persuasive with respect to the right to be forgotten follow case of the cjeu on september ruled that search engine operator is not required to remove link from all version of the search engine worldwide but the court also noted in some case removal of link from all version of the search engine available from the eu including non eu specific version may be required the introduction of new business product service and technology our activity in certain jurisdiction or other action we take may subject to additional law and regulation the cost of compliance with these law and regulation are high and are likely to increase in the future any failure on our part to comply with law and regulation can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject to significant liability and other penalty we are subject to claim suit government investigation and other proceeding that may harm our business financial condition and operating result we are subject to claim suit and government investigation involving competition intellectual property data privacy and security consumer protection tax labor and employment commercial dispute content generated by our user good and service offered by advertiser or publisher using our platform and other matter due to our manufacturing and sale of an expanded suite of product including hardware well google cloud offering we may also be subject to variety of claim including product warranty product liability and consumer protection claim related to product defect among other litigation we may also be subject to claim involving health and safety hazardous material usage other environmental impact or service disruption or failure any of these type of legal proceeding can have an adverse effect on because of legal cost diversion of management resource negative publicity and other factor determining reserve for our pending litigation is complex fact intensive process that requires significant judgment the resolution of one or more such proceeding ha resulted in and may in the future result in additional substantial fine penalty injunction and other sanction that could harm our business financial condition and operating result we may be subject to legal liability associated with providing online service or content our product and service let user exchange information advertise product and service conduct business and engage in various online activity we also place advertisement displayed on other company website and we offer third party product service and or content the law relating to the liability of online service provider for others activity on their service is still somewhat unsettled both within the and internationally claim have been brought against for defamation negligence breach of contract copyright and trademark infringement unfair competition unlawful activity tort fraud or other legal theory based on the nature and content of information available on or via our service of contentsalphabet inc we may be subject to claim by virtue of our involvement in hosting transmitting marketing branding or providing access to content created by third party defense of any such action could be costly and involve significant time and attention of our management and other resource may result in monetary liability or penalty and may require to change our business in an adverse manner privacy and data protection regulation are complex and rapidly evolving area adverse interpretation of these law could harm our business reputation financial condition and operating result authority around the world have adopted and are considering number of legislative and regulatory proposal concerning data protection and limit on encryption of user data adverse legal ruling legislation or regulation could result in fine and order requiring that we change our data practice which could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide service harming our business operation complying with these evolving law could result in substantial cost and harm the quality of our product and service negatively affecting our business recent legal development in europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding transfer of personal data from europe to the united state for example the general data protection regulation gdpr applies to all of our activity conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to product and service that we offer to eu user or customer or the monitoring of their behavior in the eu the gdpr creates range of new compliance obligation ensuring compliance with the gdpr is an ongoing commitment that involves substantial cost and despite our effort governmental authority or others have asserted and may continue to assert that our business practice fail to comply with it requirement if our operation are found to violate gdpr requirement we may incur substantial fine have to change our business practice and face reputational harm any of which could have material adverse effect on our business in particular serious breach of the gdpr can result in administrative fine of up to of annual worldwide revenue fine of up to of annual worldwide revenue can be levied for other specified violation the eu and the swiss privacy shield framework allow company that self certify to the department of commerce and publicly commit to comply with specified requirement to import personal data from the eu and switzerland however these framework face number of legal challenge and their validity remains subject to legal regulatory and political development in both europe and the the potential invalidation of data transfer mechanism could have significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the eea these development create some uncertainty and compliance obligation could cause to incur cost or harm the operation of our product and service in way that harm our business we face and may continue to face intellectual property and other claim that could be costly to defend result in significant damage award or other cost including indemnification award and limit our ability to use certain technology in the future we like other internet technology and medium company hold large number of patent copyright trademark and trade secret and are frequently subject to litigation based on allegation of infringement or other violation of intellectual property right in addition patent holding company may frequently seek to generate income from patent they have obtained by bringing claim against we have grown the number of intellectual property claim against ha increased and may continue to increase we develop new product service and technology we have had patent copyright trade secret and trademark infringement lawsuit filed against claiming that certain of our product service and technology infringe the intellectual property right of others other party have also sought broad injunctive relief against by filing claim in and international court and the international trade commission itc for exclusion and cease and desist order which could limit our ability to sell our product or service in the or elsewhere if our product or service or those of our customer or supplier are found to infringe the intellectual property subject to the claim adverse result in any of

identifiable cash flow independent of other asset an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flow generated of contentsalphabet inc from the asset are le than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over it fair value fair value measurementswe measure certain of our non marketable equity and debt investment certain other instrument including stock based compensation award settled in the stock of certain other bet and certain asset and liability acquired in business combination at fair value on nonrecurring basis the determination of fair value involves the use of appropriate valuation method and relevant input into valuation model the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the input used to measure fair value whereby it give the highest priority to quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability and the lowest priority to unobservable input we maximize the use of relevant observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input our use of unobservable input reflects the assumption that market participant would use and may include our own data adjusted based on reasonably available information we apply judgment in assessing the relevance of observable market data to determine the priority of input under the fair value hierarchy particularly in situation where there is very little or no market activity in determining the fair value of our non marketable equity and debt investment well asset acquired especially with respect to intangible asset and liability assumed in business combination we make significant estimate and assumption some of which include the use of unobservable input certain stock based compensation award may be settled in the stock of certain of our other bet or in cash these award are based on the equity value of the respective other bet which requires use of unobservable input we also have compensation arrangement with payouts based on realized investment return performance fee we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated payouts which may result in expense recognized before investment return are realized and may require the use of unobservable input non marketable equity securitiesour non marketable equity security not accounted for under the equity

from observable price change in orderly transaction for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer determining whether an observed transaction is similar to security within our portfolio requires judgment based on the right and obligation of the security recording upward and downward adjustment to the carrying value of our equity security result of observable price change requires quantitative assessment of the fair value of our security using various valuation methodology and involves the use of estimate non marketable equity security are also subject to periodic impairment review our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factor that may have significant effect on the investment fair value qualitative factor considered include industry and market condition financial performance business prospect and other relevant event and factor when indicator of impairment exist we prepare quantitative assessment of the fair value of our equity investment using both the market and income approach which require judgment and the use of estimate including discount rate investee revenue and cost and comparable market data of private and public company among others when our assessment indicates that an impairment exists we measure our non marketable security at fair value item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are

hedged included the australian dollar british pound canadian dollar euro and japanese yen for the purpose of analyzing foreign currency exchange risk we considered the historical trend in foreign currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that adverse change in exchange rate of could be experienced in the near term we use foreign exchange forward contract to offset

december and is after consideration of the offsetting effect of approximately million and million respectively from foreign exchange contract in place for the year ended december and we use foreign currency forward and option contract including collar an option strategy comprised of combination of purchased and written option to protect our forecasted dollar equivalent earnings from change in foreign currency exchange rate when the dollar strengthens gain from foreign currency option and forward reduce the foreign currency loss related to our earnings when the dollar weakens loss from foreign currency collar and forward offset the foreign currency gain related to our earnings these hedging contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate movement we designate these contract cash flow hedge for accounting purpose we reflect the gain or loss of foreign currency spot rate change component of aoci and subsequently reclassify them into revenue to offset the hedged exposure they occur if the dollar weakened by of december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign exchange contract before tax effect would have been approximately million and billion lower of december and respectively the change in the value recorded in aoci would be expected to offset corresponding foreign currency change in forecasted hedged revenue when recognized we use foreign exchange forward contract designated net investment hedge to hedge the foreign currency risk related to our investment in foreign subsidiary these forward contract serve to offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operation if the dollar weakened by the amount recorded in cumulative translation adjustment cta within aoci related to

rate interest earning security carry degree of interest rate risk fixed rate security may have their fair market value adversely affected due to rise in interest rate while floating rate security may produce le income than predicted if interest rate fall unrealized gain or loss on our marketable debt security are primarily due to interest rate fluctuation result of higher market interest rate compared to interest rate at the time of purchase we account for both fixed and variable rate security at fair value with gain and loss recorded in aoci until the security are sold we use value at

marketable debt security of december and are shown below in million of december month average of december category interest rate future gain and loss associated with our marketable debt security

under the equity method at fair value based on readily determinable market value of which publicly traded stock and mutual fund are subject to market price volatility and represent billion of our

measurement alternative the fair value is measured at the time of the observable transaction which is not necessarily an indication of the current fair value of the balance sheet date these investment especially those that are in the early stage are inherently risky because the technology or product these company have under development are typically in the early phase and may never materialize and they may experience decline in financial condition which could result in loss of substantial part of our investment in these company the success of our investment in any private company is also typically dependent on the likelihood of our ability to realize appreciation in the value of our investment through liquidity event such public offering acquisition private sale or other favorable market event of december the carrying value of our non marketable equity security which were accounted for under the measurement alternative wa billion valuation of our equity investment in private company are inherently more complex due to the lack of readily available market data volatility in the global economic climate and financial market could result in significant impairment charge on our

between market participant such fair value is market based measurement that is determined based on assumption that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability asset and liability recorded at fair value are measured and classified in accordance with three tier fair value hierarchy based on the observability of the input available in the market used to measure fair value level observable input that reflect quoted price unadjusted for identical asset or liability in active market level input that are based upon quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model based valuation technique for which all significant input are observable in the market or can be derived from observable market data where applicable these model project future cash flow and discount the future amount to present value using market based observable input including interest rate curve foreign exchange rate and credit rating level unobservable input that are supported by little or no market activity the fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value cash cash equivalent and marketable securitieswe invest all excess cash primarily in government bond corporate debt security mortgage backed and asset backed security time deposit and money market fund of contentsalphabet inc we classify all marketable investment that have stated maturity of three month or le from the date of

value of our non marketable equity investment is adjusted to fair value for observable transaction for identical or similar investment of the same issuer or impairment adjustment are determined primarily based on market approach of the transaction date we account for our non marketable investment that meet the definition of debt security available for sale security we classify our non marketable investment that do not have stated contractual maturity date non current asset on the consolidated balance sheet impairment of investmentswe periodically review our debt and equity investment for impairment for debt security we consider the duration severity and the reason for the decline in security value whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of it amortized cost basis or if the amortized cost basis can not be recovered result of credit loss if any impairment is considered other than temporary we will write the security to it fair value and record the corresponding charge other income expense net for equity security we consider impairment indicator such negative change in industry and market condition financial performance business prospect and other relevant event and factor if indicator exist and the fair value of the security is below the carrying amount we write down the security to fair value variable interest entitieswe determine at the inception of each arrangement whether an entity in which we have made an investment or in which we have other variable interest in is considered variable interest entity vie we consolidate vies when we are the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary of vie is the party that meet both of the following criterion ha the power to make decision that most significantly affect the economic performance of the vie and ha the obligation to absorb loss or the right to receive benefit that in either case could potentially be significant to the vie periodically we ass whether any change in our interest or relationship with the entity affect our determination of whether the entity is still vie and if so whether we are the primary beneficiary if

credit evaluation our payment term vary by the type and location of our customer and the product or service offered the term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant for certain product or service and customer type we require payment before the product or service are delivered to the customer of contentsalphabet inc leaseswe determine if an arrangement is lease at inception our lease agreement generally contain lease and non lease component payment under our lease arrangement are primarily fixed non lease component primarily include payment for maintenance and utility we

solar production for power purchase arrangement and payment for maintenance and utility lease asset and liability are recognized at the present value of the future lease payment at the lease commencement date the interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payment is our incremental borrowing rate because the interest rate implicit in our lease is not readily determinable our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on collateralized basis with similar term and payment and in economic environment where the leased asset is located our lease term include period under option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option we generally use the base non cancelable lease term when determining the lease asset and liability lease asset also include any prepaid lease payment and lease incentive operating lease asset and liability are included on our consolidated balance sheet

when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable we measure recoverability of these asset by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow that the asset or the asset group are expected to generate if the carrying value of the asset are not recoverable the impairment recognized is measured the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds it fair value impairment were not material for the period presented we allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the expected benefit from the business combination we evaluate our

more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired goodwill impairment were not material for the period presented intangible asset with definite life are amortized over their estimated useful life we amortize intangible asset on straight line basis with definite life generally over period ranging from one to twelve year income taxeswe account for income tax using the asset and liability method under which we recognize the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax asset and liability for the future tax consequence of event that have been recognized in our financial statement or tax return we measure current and deferred tax asset and liability based on provision of enacted tax law we evaluate the realization of our deferred tax asset based on all available evidence and establish valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that they will not be realized we recognize the financial statement effect of tax position when it is more likely than not that based on technical merit the position will be sustained upon examination the tax benefit of the position recognized in the financial statement are then measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely to be realized upon settlement with taxing authority in addition we recognize

financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit loss for financial asset held at amortized cost asu replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward looking information to calculate credit loss estimate it also eliminates the concept of other than temporary impairment and requires credit loss related to available for sale debt security to be recorded through an allowance for credit loss rather than reduction in the amortized cost basis of the security these change will result in earlier recognition of credit loss we will adopt asu effective january with the cumulative effect of adoption recorded an adjustment to
