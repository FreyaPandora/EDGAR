in our system we have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future breach of our security measure due to human error malfeasance insider threat system error or vulnerability or other irregularity we believe that paypal is particularly attractive target due to our name and brand recognition and the widespread adoption and use of our product and service any cyberattacks or data security breach affecting the information technology or infrastructure of company we acquire or of our customer partner or vendor including data center and cloud computing provider could have similar negative effect for example in november we suspended the operation of tio network tio acquired in july part of an investigation of security vulnerability of the tio platform in december we announced

to or claim by them while we maintain insurance policy our coverage may be insufficient to compensate for all loss caused by security breach business interruption or system failure may impair the availability of our website application product or service or otherwise harm our business our system and operation and those of our service provider and partner have experienced from time to time and may experience in the future business interruption or degradation of distributed denial of service and other cyberattacks insider threat hardware and software defect or malfunction human error earthquake hurricane flood fire and other natural disaster public health crisis including pandemic power loss disruption in telecommunication service fraud military or political conflict terrorist attack computer virus or other malware or other event our corporate headquarters are located in the silicon valley seismically active region in california catastrophic event that result in disruption or failure of our system or operation could result in significant loss and require substantial recovery time and significant expenditure to resume or maintain operation which could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition and result of operation additionally some of our system including those of company we have acquired are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all possible outcome or event provider of payment solution we are subject to heightened scrutiny by regulator that may require specific business continuity resiliency and disaster recovery plan and rigorous testing of such plan which may be costly and time consuming to implement and may divert our resource from other business priority of contentswe have

succeed frequent or persistent site interruption could lead to regulatory scrutiny significant fine and penalty and mandatory and costly change to our business practice and ultimately could cause to lose existing license that we need to operate or prevent or delay from obtaining additional license that may be required for our business we also rely on facility component application and service supplied by third party including data center facility and cloud storage service from time to time such third party have ceased to provide with such facility and service if these third party experience operational interference or disruption including cybersecurity incident breach their agreement with or fail to perform their obligation and meet our expectation our operation could be disrupted or otherwise negatively affected which could result in customer dissatisfaction regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation and brand and materially and adversely affect our business while we maintain business interruption insurance it may not be sufficient to reimburse for loss caused by interruption in our service result of system failure and similar event in addition any failure to successfully implement new information system and technology or improvement or upgrade to existing information system and technology in timely manner could have an adverse impact on our business internal control including internal control over financial reporting result of operation and financial condition if we can not keep pace with rapid technological development to provide new

learning development in technology supporting our regulatory and compliance obligation and in store digital mobile and social commerce we expect new service and technology to continue to emerge and evolve and we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor for the development of and access to new or evolving technology these third party may restrict or prevent our access to or utilization of those technology well their platform or product we may not be able to accurately predict which technological development or innovation will become widely adopted and how those technology may be regulated we expect that new service and technology applicable to the industry in which we operate will continue to emerge and may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service developing and incorporating new technology into our product and service may require significant investment take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful our ability to adopt new product and service and to develop new technology may be limited or restricted by industry wide standard platform provider payment network change to law and regulation changing expectation of consumer or merchant third party intellectual property right and other factor our success will depend on our ability to develop and incorporate new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard if we are unable to do in timely or cost effective manner our business

contentsfinancial resultsnet revenuesour revenue are classified into the following two category transaction revenue net fee charged to merchant and consumer on transaction basis primarily based on the tpv completed on our payment platform growth in tpv is directly impacted by the number of payment transaction that we enable on our payment platform we earn additional fee on transaction where we perform currency conversion when we enable cross border transaction transaction where the merchant and consumer are in different country to facilitate the instant transfer of fund for our customer from their paypal or venmo account to their debit card or bank account and other miscellaneous fee revenue from other value added service net revenue derived primarily from revenue earned through partnership referral fee subscription fee gateway fee and other service we provide to our merchant and consumer we also earn revenue from interest and fee earned primarily on our portfolio of loan receivable and interest earned on certain asset underlying customer balance our revenue can be significantly impacted by the following the mix of merchant product and service the mix between domestic and cross border transaction the geographic region or country in which transaction occurs and the amount of our loan receivable outstanding with merchant and consumer active account number of payment transaction number of payment transaction per active account and tpv are key non financial performance metric key metric that management us to measure the performance of our business and are defined follows an active account is an account registered directly with paypal or platform access partner that ha completed transaction on our payment platform or through our honey platform not including gateway exclusive transaction within the past month platform access partner is third party whose customer are provided access to paypal payment platform through such third party login credential the number of active account provides management with additional perspective on the growth of account across our payment and honey platform well the overall scale of our platform number of payment transaction are the total number of payment net of payment reversal successfully completed on our payment platform or enabled by paypal via partner payment solution not including gateway exclusive transaction number of payment transaction per active account reflects the total number of payment transaction within the previous month period divided by active account at the end of the period the

percent increase decrease transaction per active percent of cross border not of contentstransaction revenue grew more slowly than tpv which grew and the number of payment transaction which grew in compared to due primarily to higher proportion of transaction primarily from our venmo product from which we earn lower fee decline in hedging gain and higher portion of tpv generated by platform partner and large merchant who generally pay lower rate with higher transaction volume change in price charged to our customer did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in revenue from other value added servicesrevenues from other value added service decreased by million or in compared to due primarily to decline in interest earned on certain asset underlying customer account balance resulting from lower interest rate and decrease in interest and fee income on our loan and advance receivable due to an increase in the allowance for expected credit loss against interest and fee receivable decline in origination and payment holiday that we provided during the year to our customer part of our covid payment relief initiative additionally the decline in revenue from other value added service wa driven by decline in revenue earned from transition servicing activity provided to synchrony bank synchrony which ended in the second quarter of this decline wa partially offset

experienced by our customer and included providing payment holiday to grant payment deferral to certain borrower for varying period of time and amended payment term through loan modification in certain case these measure have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact the recognition of interest and fee income in future period given the uncertainty surrounding the covid pandemic including it duration and severity and the ultimate impact it may have on the financial condition of our merchant and consumer the extent of these type of action and their prospective impact on our interest and fee income is not determinable in addition consumer that have outstanding loan and interest receivable due to synchrony may experience similar hardship that result in increased loss recognized by synchrony which may result in decrease in our revenue share earned from synchrony in future period in the event the overall return on the paypal branded credit program funded by synchrony doe not meet minimum rate of return minimum return threshold in particular quarter our revenue share for that period would be zero further in the event the overall return on the

net revenue no individual quarter in or accounted for more than of annual net revenue critical accounting police and estimatesthe application of gaap requires to make estimate and assumption about certain item and future event that directly affect our reported financial condition we have established detailed policy and control procedure to provide reasonable assurance that the method used to make estimate and assumption are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period the accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statement an accounting estimate is considered critical if both the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved and the impact within reasonable range of outcome of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition senior management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of these estimate with the audit risk and compliance committee of our board of director our significant accounting policy including recent accounting pronouncement are described in note overview and summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included in this form quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where information is available to reasonably estimate the impact and provides material information to investor the amount used to ass sensitivity are included to allow user of this report to understand general directional cause and effect of change in the estimate and do not represent management prediction of variability for all of these estimate it should be noted that future event rarely develop exactly forecasted and estimate require regular review and adjustment transaction and credit lossestransaction and credit loss include the expense associated with our customer protection program fraud chargebacks and credit loss associated with our loan receivable balance our transaction and credit loss fluctuate depending on many factor including total tpv current and projected macroeconomic condition including unemployment rate merchant insolvency event change to and usage of our customer protection program the impact of regulatory change and the credit quality of loan receivable arising from transaction funded with our credit product which include our paypal credit consumer product and merchant loan and advance arising from our paypal working capital ppwc and paypal business loan ppbl product we establish allowance for negative customer balance and estimated transaction loss arising from processing customer transaction such chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant related chargebacks due to non delivery or unsatisfactory delivery of purchased item buyer protection program claim account takeover and automated clearing house return addition to the allowance in the form of provision are reflected in transaction and credit loss on our consolidated statement of income the allowance are based on known fact and circumstance internal factor including experience with similar case historical trend involving collection and write off pattern and the mix of transaction and loss type well current and projected macroeconomic factor appropriate of contentswe also establish an allowance for loan and interest receivable which represents our estimate of current expected credit loss inherent in our portfolio of loan and interest receivable this evaluation process is subject to numerous estimate and judgment the allowance is primarily based on expectation of credit loss based on historical lifetime loss data well macroeconomic forecast applied to the portfolio which is segmented by factor such geographic region delinquency and vintage loss curve are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segment of each portfolio categorized by factor such geographic region first borrowing versus reuse delinquency credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio we apply macroeconomic factor such forecasted trend in unemployment and benchmark credit card charge off rate which are sourced externally using single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic condition applicable to particular period we utilize externally sourced macroeconomic scenario data to supplement our historical information due to the limited period in which our credit product offering have been in existence projected loss rate inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factor are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables we also include qualitative adjustment that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimate of our current expected credit loss our consumer receivables are primarily revolving in nature and do not have contractual term however the reasonable and supportable forecast period we have included in our projected loss rate based on externally sourced data is approximately seven year our merchant receivables vary in contractual term however the reasonable and supportable forecast period we have considered for projected loss rate is approximately to year depending upon the product the allowance for credit loss on interest and fee receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curve to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factor determining appropriate current expected credit loss allowance for loan and interest receivable is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate loss may vary from the current estimate we regularly update our allowance estimate new fact become known and event occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of loss the allowance are maintained at level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for current expected credit loss at the balance sheet date after incorporating the impact of externally sourced macroeconomic forecast these forecast project scenario such future unemployment and benchmark credit card charge off rate of december we utilized externally published projection of the and forecasted unemployment rate and credit card charge off rate over the reasonable and supportable period indicating slight increase in the first half of followed by gradual decline and ultimate stabilization of these rate resulting in an overall principal and interest coverage ratio of approximately the projected gradual decline in unemployment and credit card charge off rate is reflective of prolonged recovery period where we expect to experience elevated charge off rate significant change in the forecasted macroeconomic factor could result in material change in our allowance our allowance of december ha been adjusted to account for the proactive and reactive measure that we have taken that are intended to reduce financial difficulty experienced by our customer and other limitation in our expected credit loss model that have arisen due to the extreme fluctuation in both the actual and projected macroeconomic condition during the period these qualitative adjustment were also made to incorporate varying degree of merchant performance both in the current environment well expected future performance and to account for payment holiday granted our allowance of december ha not been adjusted to account for the potential impact of the care act which are also intended to help mitigate the negative impact the current pandemic may have on the financial condition of our customer we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these action which may result in adjustment to our allowance for loan and interest receivable in future period an increase of in the principal and interest coverage ratio would increase our allowance by approximately million based on the loan and interest receivable balance outstanding of december accounting for income tax our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate that apply to our foreign earnings in addition to local country tax law and regulation our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the through provision such the gilti tax and base erosion anti abuse tax or result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning our future operation deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate that are based on number of factor including our historical experience and short range and long range business forecast to the extent deferred tax asset are not expected to be realized we record valuation allowance of contentswe recognize and measure uncertain tax position in accordance with gaap pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position the tax benefit recognized in the financial statement from such position are then measured based on the largest benefit that ha greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement we report liability for unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return gaap further requires that change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax position be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs we recognize interest and penalty if any related to unrecognized tax benefit in income tax expense we file annual income tax return in multiple taxing jurisdiction around the world number of year may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authority and finally resolved while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position we believe that our reserve for income tax are adequate such that we reflect the benefit more likely than not to be sustained in an examination we adjust these reserve well the related interest and penalty where appropriate in light of changing fact and circumstance settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash based on our result for the year ended december one percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately million loss contingencieswe are currently involved in various claim regulatory and legal proceeding and investigation of potential operating violation by regulatory oversight authority we regularly review the status of each significant matter and ass our potential financial exposure if the potential loss from any claim legal proceeding or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated we accrue liability for the estimated loss significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective and are based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim litigation or other violation and may revise our estimate due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may differ materially from the actual outcome revenue recognitionapplication of the accounting principle in gaap related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires to make judgment and estimate complex arrangement with nonstandard term and condition may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting specifically the determination of whether we are principal to transaction gross revenue or an agent net revenue can require considerable judgment further we provide incentive payment to consumer and merchant which require judgment to determine whether the payment should be recorded reduction to gross revenue change in judgment with respect to these assumption and estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized valuation of goodwill and intangiblesthe valuation of asset acquired in business combination and asset impairment review require the use of significant estimate and assumption the acquisition method of accounting for business combination requires to estimate the fair value of asset acquired liability assumed and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between asset that are depreciated or amortized and goodwill impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset our estimate are based upon assumption that we believe to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable these valuation require the use of management assumption which do not reflect unanticipated event and circumstance that may occur of contentswe evaluate goodwill and intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist under gaap the evaluation of indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment allows for qualitative assessment to be performed which is similar to gaap for evaluating goodwill for impairment in performing these qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event legal and regulatory factor and our market capitalization if the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset are le than their carrying amount we must perform quantitative impairment test under the quantitative impairment test if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income measurement of the fair value of reporting unit could be based on one or more of the following fair value measure amount at which the unit whole could be bought or sold in current transaction between willing party present value technique of estimated future

management establishes and oversees the implementation of policy governing our investing funding and foreign currency derivative activity in order to mitigate market risk we monitor risk exposure on an ongoing basis interest rate riskwe are exposed to interest rate risk relating to our investment portfolio and from interest rate sensitive asset underlying the customer balance we hold on our

applicable regulatory requirement and commercial law in certain jurisdiction where we operate equal to at least of the aggregate amount of all customer balance we do not pay interest on amount due to customer if interest rate increased by basis point the fair value of our available for sale debt security investment portfolio would decrease by approximately million and million at december and respectively we have billion in fixed rate debt with varying maturity date since these note bear interest at fixed rate they do not result in any financial statement risk associated with change in interest rate however the fair value of these note fluctuates when interest rate change we also have committed revolving credit facility of billion available to we are obligated to pay interest on borrowing under this facility well other customary fee including an upfront fee and an unused commitment fee based on our debt rating borrowing under this facility if any bear interest at floating rate result we are exposed to the risk related to fluctuation in interest rate to the extent of our borrowing of december and we had no amount outstanding under this credit facility for additional information see note debt in the note to the consolidated financial statement included in this form interest rate may also adversely impact our customer spending level and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amount owed to higher interest rate often lead to larger payment obligation by customer of our credit product to or to lender under mortgage credit card and other consumer and merchant loan which may reduce our customer ability to remain current on their obligation to and therefore lead to increased delinquency charge offs and allowance for loan and interest receivable which could have an adverse effect on our net income foreign currency exchange rate riskwe have significant operation internationally that are denominated in foreign currency primarily the british pound euro australian dollar and canadian dollar subjecting to foreign currency exchange rate risk which may adversely impact our financial result we transact business in various foreign currency and have significant international revenue and cost in addition we charge our international subsidiary for their use of intellectual property and technology and for certain corporate service our cash flow result of operation and certain of our intercompany balance that are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss due to foreign currency fluctuation and related hedging activity we are generally net receiver of foreign currency and therefore benefit from weakening of the dollar and are adversely affected by strengthening of the dollar relative to foreign currency we have foreign currency exchange exposure management program designed to identify material foreign currency exposure manage these exposure and reduce the potential effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated cash flow and result of operation through the execution of foreign currency exchange contract these foreign currency exchange contract are accounted for derivative instrument for additional detail related to our foreign currency exchange contract please see note derivative instrument to the consolidated financial statement included in this form of contentswe use foreign currency exchange forward contract to protect our forecasted dollar equivalent earnings and our investment in foreign subsidiary from adverse change in foreign currency exchange rate these hedging contract reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement we designate these contract cash flow and net investment hedge for accounting purpose the derivative gain or loss is initially reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci cash flow hedge are subsequently reclassified into the financial statement line item in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the forecasted transaction affect earnings the accumulated gain and loss associated with the net investment hedge will remain in aoci until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated at which point they will be reclassified into earnings we considered the historical trend in foreign currency exchange rate and determined that it wa reasonably possible that change in exchange rate of for all currency could be experienced in the near term if the dollar weakened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately billion and million lower respectively if the dollar strengthened by at december and the amount recorded in aoci related to our foreign currency exchange forward contract before tax would have been approximately billion and million higher respectively we have an additional foreign currency exchange management program in which we use foreign currency exchange contract to offset the foreign currency exchange risk on our asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary these contract are not designated hedging instrument and reduce but do not entirely eliminate the impact of currency exchange rate movement on our asset and liability the foreign currency exchange gain and loss on our asset and liability are recorded in other income expense net and are offset by the gain and loss on the foreign currency exchange contract adverse change in exchange rate of for all currency would have resulted in an adverse impact on income before income tax of approximately million and million at december and respectively without considering the offsetting effect of foreign currency exchange contract foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net positive impact of approximately million foreign currency exchange contract in place of december would have positively impacted income before income tax by approximately million resulting in net positive impact of approximately million these reasonably possible adverse change in exchange rate of were applied to total monetary asset and liability denominated in currency other than the functional currency of our subsidiary at the balance sheet date to compute the adverse impact these change would have had on our income before income tax in the near term equity investment riskour strategic investment are subject to variety of market related risk that could substantially reduce or increase the carrying value of the portfolio of december and our

strategic investment include marketable equity security which are publicly traded and non marketable equity security which are investment in privately held company that are not publicly traded we are required to record all adjustment to the value of these strategic investment through our consolidated statement of income such we anticipate volatility to our net income in future period due to change in fair value related to our investment in marketable equity security and change in observable price related to our non marketable equity security accounted for under the measurement alternative these change could be material based on market condition hypothetical adverse change of in the carrying value of our strategic investment which could be experienced in the near term would have resulted in decrease of approximately million to the carrying value of the portfolio of december we review our non marketable equity investment accounted for under the measurement alternative for impairment when

delinquency and vintage loss curve are generated using historical loss data for each loan portfolio and are applied to segment of each portfolio categorized by factor such geographic region first borrowing versus reuse delinquency credit rating and vintage which vary by portfolio we then apply macroeconomic factor such forecasted trend in unemployment and benchmark credit card charge off rate

and macroeconomic factor are applied to the principal amount of our consumer and merchant receivables we also include qualitative adjustment that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimate of our current expected credit loss our consumer receivables are primarily revolving in nature and do not have contractual term however the reasonable and supportable forecast period we have included in our projected loss rate based on externally sourced data is approximately seven year our merchant receivables vary in contractual term however the reasonable and supportable forecast period considered for projected loss rate is approximately to year depending upon the product the allowance for credit loss on interest and fee receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curve to each portfolio by geography delinquency and period of origination among other factor prior to the allowance for our consumer loan receivable wa primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rate roll rate roll rate are the percentage of balance which we estimate would migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience well external factor such estimated bankruptcy and level of unemployment roll rate were applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables for each stage of delinquency from current to day past the payment due date in order to estimate the principal loan which had incurred loss and were probable to be charged off for merchant loan and advance receivable the allowance wa primarily based on principal balance forecasted delinquency rate and recovery through the use of vintage based loss forecasting model the determination of delinquency from current to day past due for principal balance related to merchant receivables outstanding wa based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and interest or fixed fee compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period the allowance for loss against interest receivable wa primarily determined by applying historical average customer account roll rate to the interest receivable balance in

to develop pricing metric to be applied to historical and expected future operating result of the reporting unit failure to achieve these expected result change in the discount rate or market pricing metric may cause future impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level we conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill of august and we determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of
