channel we receive percentage of the revenue attributable to our customer purchase well in some instance incentive for channel placement we also offer pay per view channel of movie and event that are subject to revenue split with the content provider our programming cost have increased in every year we have operated in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increase we expect to continue to increase due to variety of factor including amount paid for retransmission consent annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium consolidation and carriage of incremental programming including new sport service and on line linear service and video on demand programming in particular programming cost are increasing result of significant sport programming cost increase over the past several year and the demand of large medium company who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase for all of their network in addition contract to purchase sport programming sometimes provide for optional additional game to be added to the service and made available on surcharge basis during the term of the contract programmer continue to create new network and migrate popular programming such sporting event to those network spreading popular programming across more network often result in having to pay more for suite of network offered by any one programmer finally programmer have experienced decline in demand for advertising advertiser shift more of their marketing spend online we believe this result in programmer demanding higher programming fee from programmer seek to recover revenue they are losing to online advertising federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without the station permission continuing demand by owner of broadcast station for cash payment at substantial increase over amount paid in prior year in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming cost or require to cease carriage of popular programming potentially leading to loss of customer in affected market over the past several year increase in our video service rate have not fully offset increasing programming cost and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factor we do not expect them to do so in the foreseeable future although we pas along portion of amount paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customer our inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our video customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product in order to mitigate reduction of our operating margin due to rapidly increasing programming cost we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy and we plan to continue to migrate certain program service from our more highly penetrated level of service to our le highly penetrated tier contract permit remove underperforming service and limit the launch of non essential new network we have programming contract that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of we will seek to renegotiate the term of these agreement there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may in the future be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer franchise of december our system operated pursuant to total of approximately franchise permit and similar authorization issued by local and state governmental authority such governmental authority often must approve transfer to another party most franchise are subject to termination proceeding in the event of material breach in addition most franchise require to pay the granting authority up to of revenue defined in the various agreement which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law we are entitled to and generally do pas this fee through to the customer prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchise we generally initiate renewal proceeding with the granting authority this process usually take three year but can take longer period of time the communication act of amended the communication act which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communication provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authority may not unreasonably withhold renewal in connection with the franchise renewal process many governmental authority require the cable operator to make certain commitment such building out certain of the franchise area customer service requirement and supporting and carrying public access channel historically we have been able to renew our franchise without incurring significant cost although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable term or otherwise if we fail to obtain renewal of franchise representing significant number of our customer it could have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or our liquidity our ability to comply with our debt covenant see regulation and legislation video service franchise matter marketswe operate in geographically diverse area which are organized in regional cluster these market are managed centrally on consolidated level our eleven market and the customer relationship within each market of december are follows in thousand market total customer relationship california virginia state nebraska state england louisiana we face competition for both residential and commercial customer in the area of price service offering and service reliability in our residential business we compete with other provider of video high speed internet access voice service and other source of home entertainment in our commercial business we compete with other provider of video high speed internet access and related value added service fiber solution business telephony and ethernet service we operate in competitive business environment which can adversely affect the result of our business and operation we can not predict the impact on of broadband service offered by our competitor in term of competition for customer we view member of the broadband communication industry which encompasses multi channel video for television and related broadband service such high speed internet voice and other interactive video service in the broadband communication industry our principal competitor for video service are direct broadcast satellite db and telephone company that offer video service our principal competitor for high speed internet service are the broadband service provided by telephone company including both traditional dsl fiber to the node and fiber to the home offering well wireless data provider our principal competitor for voice service are established telephone company other telephone service provider and other carrier including voip provider at this time we do not consider other traditional cable operator to be significant competitor in our overall market overbuilds are infrequent and geographically spotty although in any particular market cable operator overbuilder would likely be significant competitor at the local level we could however face additional competition from other cable operator if they began distributing video over the internet to customer residing outside their current territory our key competitor include db direct broadcast satellite is significant competitor to cable system the two largest db provider now serve more than million subscriber nationwide db service allows the subscriber to receive video service directly via satellite using dish antenna video compression technology and high powered satellite allow db provider to offer more than digital channel in major db competitor were especially competitive with promotional pricing for more basic service while we continue to believe that the initial investment by db customer exceeds that of cable customer the initial equipment cost for db ha substantially the db provider have aggressively marketed offer to new customer of incentive for discounted or free equipment installation and multiple unit db provider are able to offer service nationwide and are able to establish national image and branding with standardized offering which together with their ability to avoid franchise fee of up to of revenue and property tax lead to greater efficiency and lower cost in the lower tier of service we believe that cable delivered video on demand and subscription video on demand service which include hd programming are superior to db service cable headends can provide communication to deliver many title which customer can access and control independently whereas db technology can only make available much smaller number of title with dvr like customer control db provider have also made attempt at deployment of internet access service via satellite but those service have been technically constrained and of limited appeal telephone company and utilitiesincumbent telephone company including at inc at and verizon communication inc verizon offer video and other service in competition with and we expect they will increasingly do so in the future these company are able to offer and provide two way video data and digital voice service that are similar to in various portion of their network in the case of verizon it high speed data service fiber optic service fios offer speed high or higher than ours in addition these company continue to offer their traditional telephone service well service bundle that include wireless voice service provided by affiliated company based on internal estimate we believe that at excluding directv and verizon are offering video service in area serving approximately and respectively of our estimated residential passing and we have experienced customer loss in these area at and verizon have also launched campaign to capture more of the mdu market when at or verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video product in our market area we have seen decrease in our video revenue at and verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaign to launch their product moreover in july at completed it acquisition of directv the nation largest db provider this transaction created an even larger competitor for charter video service that ha the ability to expand it video service offering to include bundled wireless offering in addition to incumbent telephone company obtaining video franchise or alternative video authorization they have been successful through various mean in reducing or streamlining the video franchising requirement applicable to them they have had success at the federal and state level in securing fcc ruling and statewide video franchise law that facilitate telephone company entry into the video marketplace because telephone company have been successful in avoiding or reducing franchise and other regulatory requirement that remain applicable to cable operator like their competitive posture ha been enhanced in some area the large scale entry of incumbent telephone company direct competitor in the video marketplace ha adversely affected the profitability and valuation of our cable system most telephone company including at and verizon which already have plant an existing customer base and other operational function in place such billing and service personnel offer internet access via traditional dsl service dsl service allows internet access to subscriber at data transmission speed greater than those formerly available over conventional telephone line we believe dsl service is an alternative to our high speed internet service and is often offered at price lower than our internet service although typically at speed lower than the speed we offer dsl provider may currently be in better position to offer voice and data service to business since their network tend to be more extensive in commercial area we expect dsl to remain significant competitor to our high speed internet service many large incumbent telephone company also provide fiber to the node or fiber to the home service in select area of their footprint fiber to the node network can provide faster internet speed than conventional dsl but still can not typically match our internet speed our primary fiber to the node competitor is at verse the competition from at verse is expected to intensify over time at completed an expansion in based on plan announced in late and entered into additional expansion commitment in connection with it acquisition of directv fiber to the home network however can provide internet speed equal to or greater than charter current internet speed verizon fios is the primary fiber to the home competitor although at ha also begun fiber to the home build well our voice service competes directly with the voice service of incumbent telephone company and other carrier including internet based voip provider for both residential and commercial voice service customer because we offer voice service we are subject to considerable competition from such company and other telecommunication provider including wireless provider with an increasing number of consumer choosing wireless over wired telephone service the telecommunication and voice service industry is highly competitive and includes competitor with greater financial and personnel resource strong brand name recognition and long standing relationship with regulatory authority and customer moreover merger joint venture and alliance among our competitor have resulted in provider capable of offering video internet and voice service in direct competition with we are subject to limited competition from utility and or municipal utility that posse fiber optic transmission line capable of transmitting signal with minimal signal distortion traditional overbuildscable system are operated under non exclusive franchise historically granted by state and local authority more than one cable system may legally be built in the same area franchising authority may grant second franchise to another cable operator that may contain term and condition more favorable than those afforded well financed business from outside the cable industry such public utility that already posse fiber optic and other transmission line in the area they serve have in some case become competitor there are number of city that have constructed their own cable system in manner similar to city provided utility service there also ha been interest in traditional cable overbuilds by private company not affiliated with established local exchange carrier including google fiber constructing competing cable system is capital intensive process which involves high degree of risk we believe that in order to be successful competitor overbuild would need to be able to serve the home and business in the overbuilt area with equal or better service quality on more cost effective basis than we can any such overbuild operation would require access to capital or access to facility already in place that are capable of delivering cable television programming we can not predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur broadcast televisioncable television ha long competed with broadcast television which consists of television signal that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an off air antenna the extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signal available through off air reception compared to the service provided by the local cable system traditionally cable television ha provided higher picture quality and more channel offering than broadcast television however the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the fcc now provides traditional broadcaster with the ability to deliver hd television picture and multiple digital quality program stream well advanced digital service such subscription video and data transmission internet delivered videointernet access facilitates the streaming of video including movie and television show into home and business online video service include those offered by hulu netflix amazon and apple increasingly content owner are using internet based delivery of content directly to consumer some without charging fee to access the content further due to consumer electronic innovation consumer are able to watch such internet delivered content on television personal computer tablet gaming box connected to television and mobile device in hbo showtime and cbs began selling their programming direct to consumer over the internet dish network launched sling tv which includes espn among other programming and sony launched playstation vue which includes tv channel charter view online video distributor complementary and ha developed cloud based guide that can incorporate video from on line video service we believe some customer have chosen or will choose to receive video over the internet rather than through our video on demand and subscription video service thereby reducing our video revenue which may be offset by increase in our internet revenue we can not predict the impact that internet delivered video will have on our revenue and adjusted ebitda technology continue to evolve private cableadditional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television system or smatv system serving mdus such condominium apartment complex and private residential community private cable system can offer improved reception of local television station and many of the same satellite delivered program service that are offered by cable system although disadvantaged from programming cost perspective smatv system currently benefit from operating advantage not available to franchised cable system including fewer regulatory burden and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed community the fcc previously adopted regulation that favor smatv and private cable operator serving mdu complex allowing them to continue to secure exclusive contract with mdu owner this regulatory disparity provides competitive advantage to certain of our current and potential competitor other competitorslocal wireless internet service operate in some market using available unlicensed radio spectrum various wireless phone company are now offering third and fourth generation and wireless high speed internet service with fifth generation and faster service on the horizon in addition growing number of commercial area such retail mall restaurant and airport offer wi fi internet service numerous local government are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wi fi internet access network operator are also marketing pc card and personal hotspot offering wireless broadband access to their cellular network these service option offer another alternative to cable based internet access in addition certain carrier including mobile and verizon are exempting certain video traffic from data charge thus encouraging video over the internet seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation market our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our three primary service for both residential and commercial customer video service internet service and voice service cable system operation are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do so in the future we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulation or regulatory action that do not equally impact our key competitor we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future video service must carry retransmission consent there are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster alternatively federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession congress passed legislation in imposing certain restriction on broadcaster exercise of retransmission consent authority and directing the fcc to review aspect of it existing retransmission consent rule that fcc review is on going popular station invoking retransmission consent have been demanding substantial compensation increase in their recent negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost additional government mandated broadcast carriage obligation could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer service that appeal to our customer and generate revenue cable equipment in congress enacted statute requiring the fcc to adopt regulation designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for navigation device such cable set top box result the fcc required cable operator to make separate offering of security module cablecard that can be used with retail navigation device some of the fcc rule requiring support for cablecards were vacated by the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia in the fcc had also adopted an integration ban which had required cable operator to use cablecards in all of their new set top box in charter received two year waiver from the fcc integration ban on the condition that charter meet certain milestone regarding downloadable security by the end of the waiver period in december part of the satellite television extension and localism act reauthorization act of stelar congress repealed the integration ban effective december stelar also directed the fcc to establish working group of technical expert to identify and report on downloadable security design option that are not unduly burdensome and that promote competition with respect to the availability of navigation device that group issued it report in august and comment on the report were subsequently filed at the fcc the expert report identified alternative proposal but no consensus recommendation for fcc action on january the fcc chairman announced that had circulated notice of proposed rulemaking to the other fcc commissioner for vote on february and outlined proposal regarding navigation device if adopted the chairman proposal would require to allow navigation device on our network if the navigation device meet standard to be developed by third party standard setting body envisioned by the proposed rule regardless of the manufacturer of the device it remains uncertain what rule if any will ultimately be adopted and what operating or financial impact any such rule might have on including on the security of the content we obtain from programmer that is delivered over any third party navigation device customer privacy and the user experience and information security regulation the communication act limit our ability to collect and disclose subscriber personally identifiable information for our video voice and internet service well provides requirement to safeguard such information we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer subscriber and employee information further the fcc ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of cable operator including telemarketing and online marketing effort various federal agency including the ftc are now considering new restriction affecting the use of personal and profiling data for online advertising our operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc ha recently used the existing authority under it privacy and security requirement for telecommunication service to bring enforcement action several company company including one cable operator for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by and disclosure to third party with resulting settlement ranging from to million similarly the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation congress and several state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business on february the national institute for standard and technology nist in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure released voluntary framework that provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business the nist cybersecurity framework wa directed by an executive order and presidential policy directive issued in and it is designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc which is also considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement we can not predict what proposal may be adopted or new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business mdus inside wiring the fcc ha adopted series of regulation designed to spur competition to established cable operator in mdu complex these regulation allow our competitor to access certain existing cable wiring inside mdus the fcc also adopted regulation limiting the ability of established cable operator like to enter into exclusive service contract for mdu complex in their current form the fcc regulation in this area favor our competitor pole attachment the communication act requires most utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and simultaneously subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation in and again in the fcc amended it existing pole attachment rule to promote broadband deployment the order allows for new penalty in certain case involving unauthorized attachment but generally strengthens the cable industry ability to access investor owned utility pole on reasonable rate term and condition additionally the order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to telecommunication attachment to closely approximate the rate formula applicable to cable attachment the order which may still be appealed by utility pole owner continues the reconciliation of rate effectively closing the remaining loophole that potentially allowed for significantly higher rate for telecommunication than for cable attachment in certain scenario neither the order the order directly affect the rate in state that self regulate rather than allow the fcc to regulate pole rate but many of those state have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunication attachment although the and order do not impact the status quo treatment of cable provided voip service an unclassified service eligible for the favorable cable rate the issue ha not been fully resolved by the fcc and potential change in classification in pending proceeding could adversely impact our pole attachment rate in state or for period of time in which the cable rate is or wa lower than the telecommunication rate additionally although the fcc reclassification of broadband internet access telecommunication service also set forth the fcc intention that pole rate not increase result that reclassification ruling could adversely impact our pole attachment rate in state or for period of time in which the cable rate is or wa lower than the telecommunication rate cable rate regulation federal law strictly limit the potential scope of cable rate regulation pursuant to federal law all video offering are universally exempt from rate regulation except for cable system minimum level of video programming service referred to basic service and associated equipment rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to federal formula with local government commonly referred to local franchising authority primarily responsible for administering this regulation the majority of our local franchising authority have never certified to regulate basic service cable rate in the fcc adopted an order which is now under appeal reversing it historic approach to rate regulation and requiring local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rate to first make an affirmative showing that there is no effective competition defined under federal law in the community local franchise authority have filed the necessary rate regulation certification and the fcc order should make it more difficult for such entity to assert rate regulation in the future there have been call to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming cost it is possible that congress may adopt new constraint on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming any such constraint could adversely affect our operation ownership restriction federal regulation of the communication field traditionally included host of ownership restriction which limited the size of certain medium entity and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprise through series of legislative regulatory and judicial action most of these restriction have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed change in this regulatory area could alter the business environment in which we operate access channel local franchise agreement often require cable operator to set aside certain channel for public educational and governmental access programming federal law also requires cable system to designate up to of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party who may offer programming that our customer do not particularly desire the fcc adopted revised rule in mandating significant reduction in the rate that operator can charge commercial leased access user and imposing additional administrative requirement that would be burdensome on the cable industry the effect of the fcc revised rule wa stayed by federal court pending cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the office of management and budget although commercial leased access activity historically ha been relatively limited increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable system other fcc regulatory matter fcc regulation cover variety of additional area including among other thing equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical service standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming licensing of system and facility maintenance of public file emergency alert system and disability access including new requirement governing video description and closed captioning each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system in the future and we can not predict at this time how that might impact our business copyright cable system are subject to federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signal the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming copyright clearance for non broadcast programming service are arranged through private negotiation cable operator also must obtain music right for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing right organization these licensing fee have been the source of litigation in the past and we can not predict with certainty whether license fee dispute may arise in the future franchise matter cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way cable franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction cable franchise generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard and change in the ownership of the franchisee number of state subject cable system to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agency such public utility commission although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law cap local franchise fee and includes renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees from arbitrary denial of renewal even if franchise is renewed however the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirement condition of renewal similarly if local franchising authority consent is required for the purchase or sale of cable system the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent the traditional cable franchising regime ha undergone significant change result of various federal and state action the fcc ha adopted rule that streamline entry for new competitor particularly those affiliated with telephone company and reduce certain franchising burden for these new entrant the fcc adopted more modest relief for existing cable operator the same time substantial number of state have adopted new franchising law again these law were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitor and they often provide advantage for these new entrant that are not immediately available to existing cable operator in many instance these franchising regime do not apply to established cable operator until the existing franchise expires or competitor directly enters the franchise territory the exact nature of these state franchising law and their varying application to new and existing video provider will impact our franchising obligation and our competitive position internet service on february the fcc adopted an order that reclassified broadband internet service title ii service applied certain existing title ii provision and associated regulation including requiring that rate and practice be just reasonable and nondiscriminatory allowing complaint in court and before the fcc imposing privacy and disability obligation and providing broadband provider with access to pole and conduit forbore from applying range of other existing title ii provision and associated regulation but to varying degree indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary and issued new rule expanding disclosure requirement and prohibiting blocking throttling paid prioritization and unreasonable interference with the ability of end user and edge provider to reach each other the order also subjected broadband provider internet traffic exchange rate and practice to potential fcc oversight and created mechanism for third party to file complaint regarding these matter the order ha been appealed by multiple party but the rule are currently in effect except for the expanded disclosure requirement which will not become effective until they receive approval from the office of management and budget the order could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service including whether that service should be regulated under title ii while we can not predict what rule the fcc will adopt part of these rulemakings any change to the regulatory framework for our internet or voip service could have negative impact on our business and result of operation charter ha however made certain commitment to comply with the fcc order in connection with the fcc review of charter pending twc transaction and bright house transaction the internet ha matured it ha become the subject of increasing regulatory interest congress and federal regulator have adopted wide range of measure directly or potentially affecting internet use including for example consumer privacy copyright protection defamation liability taxation obscenity and unsolicited commercial mail our internet service are subject to the communication assistance for law enforcement act calea requirement regarding law enforcement surveillance pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect our operation an internet service provider and our relationship with our internet customer additionally the fcc and congress are considering subjecting internet access service to the universal service funding requirement these funding requirement could impose significant new cost on our high speed internet service also the fcc and some state regulatory commission direct certain subsidy to telephone company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved charter ha opposed such subsidy when directed to area that charter serf despite charter effort future subsidy may be directed to area served by charter which could result in subsidized competitor operating in our service territory state and local governmental organization have also adopted internet related regulation these various governmental jurisdiction are also considering additional regulation in these and other area such privacy pricing service and product quality and taxation the adoption of new internet regulation or the adaptation of existing law to the internet could adversely affect our business the fcc is considering whether online video distributor ovds that offer programming to customer with broadband internet connection should be classified multichannel video programming distributor mvpds and thereby subject to the program access protection available to mvpds well some of the regulatory requirement applicable to mvpds the outcome of this proceeding which could impact how ovds compete in the future with traditional cable service can not be determined at the current time on january the fcc in nation wide proceeding evaluating whether advanced broadband is being deployed in reasonable and timely fashion increased the minimum connection speed required to qualify advanced broadband service to mbps for downloads and mbps for uploads result the fcc concluded that advanced broadband wa not being sufficiently deployed and initiated new inquiry into what step it might take to encourage broadband deployment this action may lead the fcc to adopt additional measure affecting our broadband business at the same time the fcc ha ongoing proceeding to allocate additional spectrum for advanced wireless service which could provide additional wireless competition to our broadband business the fcc recently granted petition from municipality in north carolina and tennessee seeking the preemption of state law that restrict the ability of municipality to construct and deploy broadband system in competition with private offering municipality in other state may seek similar relief there are approximately such state law now in effect fcc preemption predicated on the belief that such state law are impeding the nation wide deployment of broadband service the fcc ruling have been appealed and are pending in the circuit if the fcc order are upheld it could lead to increased competition from municipal provided broadband voice servicethe telecommunication act of created more favorable regulatory environment for to provide telecommunication and or competitive voice service than had previously existed in particular it established requirement ensuring that competitive telephone company could interconnect their network with those provider of traditional telecommunication service to open the market to competition the fcc ha subsequently ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnection with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market since that time the fcc ha initiated proceeding to determine whether such interconnection right should extend to traditional and competitive network utilizing ip technology and how to encourage the transition to ip network throughout the industry new rule or obligation arising from these proceeding may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service in november the fcc released an order subsequently upheld on appeal that significantly changed the rule governing intercarrier compensation payment for the termination of telephone traffic between carrier that change resulted in substantial decrease in the intercarrier compensation payment we receive and those payment will continue to decrease the decrease over the multi year transition will however affect not only the amount that charter receives from other carrier but also the amount that charter pay to other carrier the schedule and magnitude of these decrease however will vary depending on the nature of the carrier and the telephone traffic at issue and if the fcc make further rule change we can not predict with certainty the balance of the impact on charter revenue and expense for voice service at particular time over this multi year period the fcc ha collected extensive data from provider of point to point transport special access service such charter and the fcc will use that data to evaluate whether the market for such service is competitive or whether the market should be subject to further regulation which may increase our cost or constrain our ability to compete in this market the fcc also recently selected new national local number portability administrator and the change to that new administrator may adversely impact our ability to manage number porting and related task further regulatory change are being considered that could impact our voice business and that of our primary telecommunication competitor the fcc and state regulatory authority are considering for example whether certain common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carrier should be modified or reduced and the extent to which common carrier requirement should be extended to voip provider the fcc ha already determined that certain provider of voice service using internet protocol technology must comply with requirement relating to emergency service the calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information issue number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee and discontinuance of service in november the fcc adopted an order imposing limited back up power obligation on provider of facility based fixed residential voice service that are not otherwise line powered including our voip service this order becomes effective in february and requires to disclose certain information to customer and to make back up power available at the point of sale in march federal appeal court affirmed the fcc decision concerning federal regulation of certain voip service but declined to specifically find that voip service provided by cable company such we provide should be regulated only at the federal level result some state have begun proceeding to subject cable voip service to state level regulation and at least one state ha asserted jurisdiction over our voip service we have filed legal challenge to that state assertion of jurisdiction which is now pending before federal district court in minnesota although we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure the continuity of our service and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangement it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved employee of december we had approximately full time equivalent employee at december approximately of our employee were represented by collective bargaining agreement we have never experienced work stoppage risk factor risk related to our indebtedness we have significant amount of debt and may incur significant additional debt including secured debt in the future which could adversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to change in our business we have significant amount of debt and may subject to applicable restriction in our debt instrument incur additional debt in the future of december our total principal amount of debt wa approximately billion including billion of debt for which proceeds are held in escrow pending consummation of the twc transaction our significant amount of debt could have consequence such impact our ability to raise additional capital at reasonable rate or at all make vulnerable to interest rate increase because approximately of our borrowing of december were and may continue to be subject to variable rate of interest expose to increased interest expense to the extent we refinance existing debt with higher cost debt require to dedicate significant portion of our cash flow from operating activity to make payment on our debt reducing our fund available for working capital capital expenditure and other general corporate expense limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business the cable and telecommunication industry and the economy at large place at disadvantage compared to our competitor that have proportionately le debt and adversely affect our relationship with customer and supplier if current debt amount increase the related risk that we now face will intensify the agreement and instrument governing our debt contain restriction and limitation that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business well significantly affect our liquidity our credit facility and the indenture governing our debt contain number of significant covenant that could adversely affect our ability to operate our business our liquidity and our result of operation

whether fraudulent transfer ha occurred generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the sum of it debt including contingent liability wa greater than the fair saleable value of all it asset the present fair saleable value of it asset wa le than the amount that would be required to pay it probable liability on it existing debt including contingent liability they become absolute and mature or it could not pay it debt they became due while we believe that our relevant subsidiary currently have surplus and are not insolvent these subsidiary may become insolvent in the future our direct or indirect subsidiary include the borrower and guarantor under the charter operating credit facility and the entity that will be issuer and guarantor under the cco safari ii note upon consummation of the twc transaction cco holding and ccoh safari are also obligors under their respective senior note and cco safari iii is an obligor under it credit facility of december our total

and charter operating is limited in it ability to make distribution or other payment to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase in addition change of control under the charter operating credit facility would result in default under those credit facility which would trigger default under the indenture governing the cco holding note and cco safari ii note because such credit facility and note are obligation of charter operating and it subsidiary the credit facility would have to be repaid before charter operating asset could be available to cco holding or ccoh safari to repurchase their note any failure to make or complete change of control offer would place cco holding or ccoh safari in default under their note the failure of our subsidiary to make change of control offer or repay the amount accelerated under their note and credit facility would place them in default under such agreement risk related to our business we operate in very competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden better access to financing greater personnel resource greater resource for marketing greater and more favorable brand name recognition and long established relationship with regulatory authority and customer increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rule have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale we could also face additional competition from multi channel video provider if they began distributing video over the internet to customer residing outside their current territory our principal competitor for video service throughout our territory are db provider the two largest db provider are directv which is owned by at and dish network competition from db including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting ha had an adverse impact on our ability to retain customer db company have also expanded their activity in the mdu market telephone company including two major telephone company at and verizon offer video and other service in competition with and we expect they will increasingly do so in the future upgraded portion of these network carry two way video data service and provide digital voice service similar to ours in the case of verizon fios high speed data service offer speed high or higher than ours in addition these company continue to offer their traditional telephone service well service bundle that include wireless voice service provided by affiliated company based on our internal estimate we believe that at excluding directv and verizon are offering video service in area serving approximately and respectively of our estimated residential passing and we have experienced customer loss in these area at and verizon have also launched campaign to capture more of the mdu market when at or verizon have introduced or expanded their offering of video product in our market area we have seen decrease in our video revenue at and verizon typically roll out aggressive marketing and discounting campaign to launch their product additionally in july at completed it acquisition of directv the nation largest db provider and in connection with that acquisition at committed to expand fiber to the premise service to million location this transaction created an even larger competitor for charter video service that ha the ability to expand it video service offering to include bundled wireless offering due to consumer electronic innovation content owner are allowing consumer to watch internet delivered content on television personal computer tablet gaming box connected to television and mobile device some without charging fee to access the content technological advancement such video on demand new video format and internet streaming and downloading have increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choice available to consumer and intensified the challenge posed by audience fragmentation for example online video service continue to offer consumer alternative including hulu netflix amazon and apple in hbo and cbs began selling their programming direct to consumer over the internet dish network launched sling tv which includes espn among other programming and sony launched playstation vue which includes tv channel the increasing number of choice available to audience could also negatively impact advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from well the price they are willing to pay for advertising respect to our internet access service we face competition including intensive marketing effort and aggressive pricing from telephone company primarily at and verizon and other provider of dsl fiber to the node and fiber to the home service dsl service competes with our internet service and is often offered at price lower than our internet service although often at speed lower than the speed we offer fiber to the node network can provide faster internet speed than conventional dsl but still can not typically match our internet speed fiber to the home network however can provide internet speed equal to or greater than our current internet speed in addition in many of our market dsl provider have entered into co marketing arrangement with db provider to offer service bundle combining video service provided by db provider with dsl and traditional telephone and wireless service offered by the telephone company and their affiliate these service bundle offer customer similar pricing and convenience advantage our bundle continued growth in our residential voice business face risk the competitive landscape for residential and commercial telephone service is intense we face competition from provider of internet telephone service well incumbent telephone company further we face increasing competition for residential voice service more consumer in the united state are replacing traditional telephone service with wireless service we expect to continue to price our voice product aggressively part of our triple play strategy which could negatively impact our revenue from voice service to the extent we do not increase volume the existence of more than one cable system operating in the same territory is referred to an overbuild overbuilds could adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation by creating or increasing competition we are aware of traditional overbuild situation impacting certain of our market however we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur in order to attract new customer from time to time we make promotional offer including offer of temporarily reduced price or free service these promotional program result in significant advertising programming and operating expense and also may require to make capital expenditure to acquire and install customer premise equipment customer who subscribe to our service result of these offering may not remain customer following the end of the promotional period failure to retain customer could have material adverse effect on our business merger joint venture and alliance among franchised wireless or private cable operator db provider local exchange carrier and others may provide additional benefit to some of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale or the ability to provide multiple service in direct competition with in addition to the various competitive factor discussed above our business competes with all other source of entertainment and information delivery including broadcast television movie live event radio broadcast home video product console game print medium and the internet if we do not respond appropriately to further increase in the leisure and entertainment choice available to consumer our competitive position could deteriorate and our financial result could suffer our service may not allow to compete effectively competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including debt service requirement our exposure to the economic condition of our current and potential customer vendor and third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to risk associated with the economic condition of our current and potential customer the potential financial instability of our customer and their financial ability to purchase our product if there were general economic downtown we may experience increased cancellation by our customer or unfavorable change in the mix of product purchased these event have adversely affected in the past and may adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition if downturn were to occur in addition we are susceptible to risk associated with the potential financial instability of the vendor and third party on which we rely to provide product and service or to which we outsource certain function the same economic condition that may affect our customer well volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market also could adversely affect vendor and third party and lead to significant increase in price reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendor or third party upon which we rely any interruption in the service provided by our vendor or by third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition face risk inherent in our commercial business we may encounter unforeseen difficulty we increase the scale of our service offering to business we sell internet access data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular tower and office building video and business voice service to business and have increased our focus on growing this business in order to grow our commercial business we expect to continue investment in technology equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business commercial business customer often require service level agreement and generally have heightened customer expectation for reliability of service if our effort to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful the growth of our commercial service business would be limited we depend on interconnection and related service provided by certain third party for the growth of our commercial business result our ability to implement change the service grow may be limited if we are unable to meet these service level requirement or expectation our commercial business could be adversely affected finally we expect advance in communication technology well change in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment consequently we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future development in these area might have on our voice and commercial business and operation programming cost are rising at much faster rate than wage or inflation and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rate of or pas on to our customer our increasing programming cost which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin programming ha been and is expected to continue to be our largest operating expense item in recent year the cable industry ha experienced rapid escalation in the cost of programming we expect programming cost to continue to increase because of variety of factor including amount paid for retransmission consent annual increase imposed by programmer with additional selling power result of medium consolidation incremental programming including new sport service out of home or non linear programming and attempt by programmer to replace advertising revenue they are losing to online marketing option and result of declining viewership rating the inability to fully pas these programming cost increase on to our customer ha had an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product we have programming contract that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we may be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which could result in further loss of customer increased demand by owner of some broadcast station for carriage of other service or payment to those broadcaster for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming cost federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the latter cable operator are not allowed to carry the station signal without the station permission in some case we carry station under short term arrangement while we attempt to negotiate new long term retransmission agreement if negotiation with these programmer prove unsuccessful they could require to cease carrying their signal possibly for an indefinite period any loss of station could make our video service le attractive to customer which could result in le subscription and advertising revenue in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result our inability to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could limit our ability to compete effectively our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new product and service some of which are bandwidth intensive we may not be able to fund the capital expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development execute the plan to do so or anticipate the demand of our customer for product and service requiring new technology or bandwidth the implementation of our network based user interface spectrum guide and downloadable security necessary for our worldbox set top box strategy may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated in order to realize the benefit of our worldbox technology we must implement our downloadable conditional access security in our regional video network our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service such state of the art user interface in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer consequently our growth financial condition and result of operation could suffer materially depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors to supply some of the service hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our service we obtain these material from limited number of vendor some of which do not have long operating history or which may not be able to continue to supply the equipment and service we desire some of our hardware software and operational support vendor and service provider represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or result of intellectual property right position of some exclusivity if demand exceeds these vendor capacity or if these vendor experience operating or financial difficulty or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner at our specification and at reasonable price our ability to provide some service might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative source of the affected material or service might delay our ability to serve our customer these event could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customer and have material negative impact on our operation business financial result and financial condition limited number of vendor of key technology can lead to le product innovation and higher cost our cable system have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security system which we believe ha limited the number of manufacturer producing set top box for such system an alternative charter ha developed conditional access security system which may be downloaded into set top box with feature we specify that could be provided by variety of manufacturer we refer to our specified set top box our worldbox in order to realize the benefit of our worldbox technology we must now implement the conditional access security system across our video network we can not provide assurance that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget we further depend on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law and license to establish and maintain our intellectual property right in technology and the product and service used in our operating activity any of our intellectual property right could be challenged or invalidated or such intellectual property right may not be sufficient to permit to continue to use certain intellectual property which could result in discontinuance of certain product or service offering or other competitive harm our incurring substantial monetary liability or being enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question various event could disrupt our network information system or property and could impair our operating activity and negatively impact our reputation network and information system technology are critical to our operating activity well our customer access to our service we may be subject to information technology system failure and network disruption malicious and abusive activity such the dissemination of computer virus worm and other destructive or disruptive software computer hackings social engineering process breakdown denial of service attack and other malicious activity have become more common in industry overall if directed at or technology upon which we depend these activity could have adverse consequence on our network and our customer including degradation of service excessive call volume to call center and damage to our or our customer equipment and data further these activity could result in security breach such misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology system and network and in our vendor system and network including customer personnel and vendor data system failure and network disruption may also be caused by natural disaster accident power disruption or telecommunication failure if significant incident were to occur it could damage our reputation and credibility lead to customer dissatisfaction and ultimately loss of customer or revenue in addition to increased cost to service our customer and protect our network these event also could result in large expenditure to repair or replace the damaged property network or information system or to protect them from similar event in the future system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality any significant loss of customer or revenue or significant increase in cost of serving those customer could adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation for tax purpose we could experience deemed ownership change in the future that could limit our ability to use our tax loss carryforwards of december we had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary in addition of december we had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through due to uncertainty in projected future taxable income valuation allowance have been established against the gross deferred tax asset for book purpose except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary difference for which deferred tax liability are recognized such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset our future taxable income in the past we have experienced ownership change defined in section of the internal revenue code of amended the code in general an ownership change occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of corporation owned directly or indirectly by percent stockholder within the meaning of section of the code increase by more than percentage point over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned directly or indirectly by such percent stockholder at any time over the preceding three year result charter is and following the twc transaction new charter or if only the bright house transaction is completed charter will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of our loss carryforwards which existed at november for the first ownership change and those that existed at may for the second ownership change the limitation on our ability to use our loss carryforwards in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provision could reduce our ability to use portion of our loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income which could result in being required to make material cash tax payment our ability to make such income tax payment if any will depend at such time on our liquidity or our ability to raise additional capital and or on receipt of payment or distribution from charter holdco and it subsidiary if we were to experience third ownership change in the future result of the transaction with twc bright house and liberty broadband or from purchase and sale of stock by our percent stockholder new issuance or redemption of our stock certain acquisition of our stock and issuance redemption sale or other disposition or acquisition of interest in our percent stockholder our ability to use our loss carryforwards could become subject to further limitation our common stock is subject to certain transfer restriction contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation these restriction which are designed to minimize the likelihood of an ownership change occurring and thereby preserve our ability to utilize our loss carryforwards are not currently operative but could become operative in the future if certain event occur and the restriction are imposed by our board of director however there can be no assurance that our board of director would choose to impose these restriction or that such restriction if imposed would prevent an ownership change from occurring these restriction will be eliminated if the bright house transaction is consummated if we are unable to retain key employee our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected our operational result have depended and our future result will depend upon the retention and continued performance of our management team our ability to retain and hire new key employee for management position could be impacted adversely by the competitive environment for management talent in the broadband communication industry the loss of the service of key member of management and the inability or delay in hiring new key employee could adversely affect our ability to manage our business and our future operational and financial result our inability to successfully acquire and integrate other business asset product or technology could harm our operating result we continuously evaluate and pursue small and large acquisition and strategic investment in business product or technology that we believe could complement or expand our business or otherwise offer growth or cost saving opportunity from time to time we may enter into letter of intent with company with which we are negotiating for potential acquisition or investment or to which we are conducting due diligence an investment in or acquisition of complementary business product or technology in the future could materially decrease the amount of our available cash or require to seek additional equity or debt financing we may not be successful in negotiating the term of any potential acquisition conducting thorough due diligence financing the

charter twc and or bright house employee the loss of subscriber and customer the disruption of the company ongoing business or in unexpected integration issue higher than expected integration cost and an overall post completion integration process that take longer than originally anticipated the process of integrating twc bright house or twc and bright house with the business charter operated prior

we already face and proposal that might make it easier for our employee to unionize some state are considering adopting energy efficiency regulation governing the operation of equipment such broadband modem that we use to deliver internet service which could constrain innovation in broadband service and equipment congress and various federal agency are also considering legislation and rule that would further regulate such new privacy restriction and new restriction on the use of personal and profiling information for behavioral advertising in response to recent global data breach malicious

necessary approval of the transaction or impose additional regulatory condition in connection with their review of the transaction that could affect our operation change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on charter business legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase charter cost or

provision and associated regulation including requiring that rate and practice be just reasonable and nondiscriminatory allowing complaint in court and before the fcc imposing privacy and disability obligation and providing broadband provider with access to pole and conduit forbore from applying range of other existing title ii provision and associated regulation but to varying degree indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary and issued new rule expanding disclosure requirement and prohibiting blocking throttling paid prioritization and unreasonable interference with the ability of end user and edge provider to reach each other the order also subjected broadband provider internet traffic exchange rate and practice to potential fcc oversight for the first time and created mechanism for third party to file complaint regarding these matter the order ha been appealed by multiple party but the rule are currently in effect except for the expanded disclosure requirement which will not become effective until they receive approval from the office of management and budget the order could have material adverse effect on charter business and result of operation the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service including whether that service should be regulated under title ii while charter can not predict what rule the fcc will adopt part of these rulemakings any change to the regulatory framework for charter internet or voip service could have negative impact on it business and result of operation the fcc is considering numerous other

regime ha undergone significant change result of various federal and state action some state franchising law do not allow incumbent operator like to opt into favorable statewide franchising quickly new entrant and often require to retain certain franchise obligation that are more burdensome than those applied to new entrant we can not assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provision of our franchise agreement and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreement additionally although historically we have renewed our franchise without incurring significant cost we can not assure you that we will be able to renew or to renew favorably our franchise in the future termination of or sustained failure to renew franchise in one or more key market could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area our cable system franchise are non exclusive accordingly local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise and create additional competition for our product resulting in overbuilds which could adversely affect result of operation our cable system franchise are non exclusive consequently local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise to competitor in the same geographic area or operate their own cable system in some case local government entity and municipal utility may legally compete with on more favorable term the fcc recently adopted an order currently under appeal rejecting state law in north carolina and tennessee that restricted municipality from providing broadband service in addition potential competitor like google have recently pursued and obtained local franchise that are more favorable than the incumbent operator franchise result competing operator may build system in area in which we hold franchise the fcc ha adopted rule that streamline entry for new competitor particularly those affiliated with telephone company and reduce franchising burden for these new entrant at the same time substantial number of state have adopted new franchising law principally designed to streamline entry for new competitor and often provide advantage for these new entrant that are not immediately available to existing operator broadband delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligation applicable to our traditional cable system the fcc administers program that collect universal service fund contribution from telecommunication service provider and us them to subsidize the provision of telecommunication service in high cost area and to low income consumer and the provision of internet and telecommunication service to school library and certain health care provider variety of regulatory change may lead the fcc to expand the collection of universal service fund contribution to encompass internet service provider the fcc already ha begun to redirect the expenditure of some universal service funding to broadband deployment in way that could assist competitor in competing with our service local franchise authority have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraint on our business which could further increase our expense in addition to the franchise agreement cable authority in some jurisdiction have adopted cable regulatory ordinance that further regulate the operation of cable system this additional regulation increase the cost of operating our business local franchising authority may impose new and more restrictive requirement local franchising authority who are certified to regulate rate in the community they operate generally have the power to reduce rate and order refund on the rate charged for basic service and equipment tax legislation and administrative initiative or challenge to our tax position could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we operate cable system in location throughout the united state and result we are subject to the tax law and regulation of federal state and local government from time to time various legislative and or administrative initiative may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax position there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payment will not be adversely affected by these initiative certain state and locality have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional tax or fee on our service or changing the methodology or base on which certain fee and tax are computed the federal internet tax freedom act which prohibits many tax on internet access service will expire october unless it is renewed by congress potential change include additional tax or fee on our service which could impact our customer combined reporting and other change to general business tax central unit level assessment of property tax and other matter that could increase our income franchise sale use and or property tax liability in addition federal state and local tax law and regulation extremely complex and subject to varying interpretation there can be no assurance that our tax position will not be challenged by relevant tax authority or that we would be successful in any such challenge further regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rate to cover our increasing cost resulting in increased loss currently rate regulation of cable system is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activity and the fcc recently revised it rule in response to changed market condition to make it more difficult for local franchising authority to assert rate regulation authority however the fcc and congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increase are exceeding inflation it is possible that either the fcc or congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operator to implement rate increase for our video service or even for our high speed internet and voice service should this occur it would impede our ability to raise our rate if we are unable to raise our rate in response to increasing cost our loss would increase there ha been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring company that own multiple cable network to make each of them available on standalone rather than bundled basis to cable operator and in requiring cable operator to offer historically bundled programming service on an la carte basis to consumer while any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operator to purchase programming on standalone basis could be beneficial to charter any regulation or legislation that limit how we sell programming could adversely affect our business action by pole owner might subject to significantly increased pole attachment cost pole attachment are cable wire that are attached to utility pole cable system attachment to investor owned public utility pole historically have been regulated at the federal or state level generally resulting in favorable pole attachment rate for attachment used to provide cable service in contrast utility pole owned by municipality or cooperative are not subject to federal regulation and are generally exempt from state regulation future regulatory change in this area could impact the pole attachment rate we pay utility company change in channel carriage regulation could impose significant additional cost on cable operator also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage we can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily including certain local broadcast signal local public educational and governmental access peg programming and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming required channel capacity for use by person unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over cable system the fcc adopted revised commercial leased access rule which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burden but these remain stayed while under appeal legislation ha been introduced in congress in the past that if adopted could impact our carriage of broadcast signal by simultaneously eliminating the cable industry compulsory copyright license and the retransmission consent requirement governing cable retransmission of broadcast signal the fcc also continues to consider change to the rule affecting the relationship between programmer including broadcaster and multichannel video distributor future regulatory change could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity increase our programming cost and limit our ability to offer service that would maximize our revenue potential it is possible that other legal restraint will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decision our voice service is subject to regulatory burden which may increase causing to incur additional cost we offer voice communication service over our broadband network using voip service the fcc ha ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnect with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market the scope of these interconnection right are being reviewed in current fcc proceeding which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service or result in additional cost the fcc ha also declared that certain voip service are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation the full extent of the fcc preemption of state and local regulation of voip service is not yet clear and at least one state minnesota ha asserted jurisdiction over the company voip service we have filed legal challenge to that jurisdictional assertion which is now pending before federal district court in minnesota telecommunication company generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to voip provider if additional telecommunication regulation are applied to our voip service it could cause to incur additional cost the fcc ha already extended certain traditional telecommunication carrier requirement to many voip provider such including universal service fund collection calea privacy of customer proprietary network information number porting network outage reporting call completion reporting disability access and discontinuance of service requirement in addition the fcc is subjecting our voip service to new back up power obligation that were effective beginning february in the fcc released an order subsequently upheld on appeal that significantly changed the rule governing intercarrier compensation payment for the origination and termination of telephone traffic between carrier including voip service provider like this change will result in substantial decrease in intercarrier compensation payment over multi year period item

approximately million residential and small and medium business customer at december we offer our customer traditional cable video programming internet service and voice service well advanced video service such video on demand hd television and dvr service we also sell local advertising on cable network and provide fiber connectivity to cellular tower and office building see part item business product and service for further description of these service including customer statistic for different service our most significant competitor are direct broadcast satellite provider and certain telephone company that offer service that provide feature and function similar to our internet video and voice service including in some case wireless service and they also offer these service in bundle similar to ours customer have been more willing to consider our competitor product partially because of continued marketing highlighting perceived difference between competitive video product especially when those competitor are often offering significant incentive to switch provider some consumer have chosen to receive video over the internet rather than through pay television service including from see part item business competition in the recent past we have grown revenue by offsetting basic video customer loss with price increase and sale of incremental service such internet video on demand dvr and hd television we expect to continue to grow revenue by increasing the number of product in our current customer home obtaining new customer with our value offering and reducing churn in addition we expect to increase revenue by expanding the sale of service to our commercial customer however we can not assure you that we will be able to grow revenue or maintain our margin at recent historical rate our business plan include goal for increasing customer and revenue to reach our goal we actively invest in our network and operation and improve the quality and value of the product and package that we offer we have enhanced our video product by moving to an all digital platform offering more hd channel and increasing digital and hd dvr penetration we simplified our offer

factor discussed above income from operation wa affected by increase in other operating expense such merger and acquisition cost well increase in depreciation and amortization and stock compensation expense and of our revenue for year ended december and respectively are attributable to monthly subscription fee charged to customer for our video internet voice and commercial service provided by our cable system generally these customer subscription may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to fee for certain commercial customer the remaining and of revenue for fiscal year and

for billion in cash well working capital adjustment and reduction for certain funded indebtedness of bresnan the bresnan acquisition bresnan managed cable operating system in colorado montana wyoming and utah that passed approximately home and served approximately residential and commercial customer relationship at the time they were acquired we have history of net loss our net loss are principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expense interest expense that we incur because of our debt depreciation expense resulting from the capital investment we have made and continue to make in our cable property amortization expense related to our customer relationship intangible and non cash tax resulting from increase in our deferred tax liability critical accounting policy and estimate certain of our accounting policy require our management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgment management ha discussed these policy with the audit committee of charter board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed the following disclosure we consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the estimate assumption and judgment that are involved in preparing our financial statement and the uncertainty that could affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow property plant and equipment capitalization of labor and overhead cost valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment useful life of property plant and equipment intangible asset valuation and impairment of franchise valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationship valuation and impairment of goodwill income tax litigation programming agreement addition there are other item within our financial statement that require estimate or judgment that are not deemed critical such the allowance for doubtful account and valuation of our derivative instrument but change in estimate or judgment in these other item could also have material impact on our financial statement property plant and equipmentthe cable industry is capital intensive and large portion of our resource are spent on capital activity associated with extending rebuilding and upgrading our cable network of december and the net carrying amount of our property plant and equipment consisting primarily of cable network asset wa approximately billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent and billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent respectively total capital expenditure for the year ended december and were approximately billion billion and billion respectively capitalization of labor and overhead cost cost associated with network construction initial customer installation installation refurbishment and the installation of equipment necessary to provide video internet or voice service are capitalized while our capitalization is based on specific activity once capitalized we track these cost by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation cost capitalized part of installation include material direct labor and certain indirect cost these indirect cost are associated with the activity of personnel who assist in installation activity and consist of compensation and overhead cost associated with these support function the cost of disconnecting service at customer dwelling or reconnecting service to previously installed dwelling are charged to operating expense in the period incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain component and betterment including replacement of cable drop from the pole to the dwelling are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection or placement of equipment verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and or receiving advanced or internet service customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with customer installation installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video internet or voice service and equipment replacement and betterment and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer digital set top box well testing signal level at the pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity consisting primarily of installation and construction vehicle cost iii the cost of support personnel such dispatcher who directly assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity while we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our system activity could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy we capitalized internal direct labor and overhead of million million and million respectively for the year ended december and valuation and impairment we evaluate the recoverability of our property plant and equipment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such event or change in circumstance could include such factor the impairment of our indefinite life franchise change in technological advance in the fair value of such asset adverse change in relationship with local franchise authority adverse change in market condition or deterioration of current or expected future operating result long lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flow associated with the asset no impairment of long lived asset to be held and used were recorded in the year ended december and we utilize the cost approach the primary method used to establish fair value for our property plant and equipment in connection with business combination the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing new asset with similar utility then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence of the appraisal date the cost approach relies on management assumption regarding current material and labor cost required to rebuild and repurchase significant component of our property plant and equipment along with assumption regarding the age and estimated useful life of our property plant and equipment useful life of property plant and equipment we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful life assigned to our property plant and equipment based on annual analysis of such useful life and revise such life to the extent warranted by changing fact and circumstance any change in estimated useful life result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed our analysis of useful life in did not indicate change in useful life the effect of one year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately million the effect of one year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million depreciation expense related to property plant and equipment totaled billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively representing approximately and of cost and expense respectively depreciation is recorded using the straight line composite method over management estimate of the useful life of the related asset listed below cable distribution system yearscustomer premise equipment and installation yearsvehicles and equipment yearsbuildings and improvement yearsfurniture fixture and equipment yearsintangible asset valuation and impairment of franchise the net carrying value of franchise of both december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent for more information and complete discussion of how we value and test franchise asset for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data in we performed qualitative impairment assessment that indicated the fair value of the franchise asset in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such asset and thus resulted in no impairment our unit of accounting for franchise impairment testing is based on geographical clustering of our cable system into group or market for each franchise unit of accounting the estimated fair value of the franchise asset substantially exceeds the carrying value based on our qualitative impairment assessment and sensitivity analysis none of our franchise asset are considered at risk of impairment based on the qualitative assessment the franchise asset fair value are more than twice the carrying value for nearly all of the franchise unit of accounting the only exception is single market in which it fair value of franchise asset exceeds it carrying value by more than the lower excess fair value of this market when compared to the others is attributed to the recent fair value measurement of this market franchise asset in purchase accounting valuation and impairment of goodwill the net carrying value of goodwill of both december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent for more information and complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data with our franchise impairment testing in we elected to perform qualitative assessment and concluded that goodwill is not impaired based on the qualitative assessment and sensitivity analysis implied goodwill is more than three time it carrying value impairment and amortization of customer relationship the net carrying value of customer relationship of december and wa approximately million representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent and billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent respectively amortization expense related to customer relationship for the year ended december and wa approximately million million and million respectively no impairment of customer relationship wa recorded in the year ended december or for more information and complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data income tax of december charter had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through with million expiring through billion expiring between and and billion expiring thereafter these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary in addition of december charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter future taxable income of december billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are unrestricted and available for charter immediate use while approximately billion of federal tax loss carryforwards are still subject to section and other restriction pursuant to these restriction charter estimate that approximately million in and an additional million annually over each of the next eight year of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charter use charter state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restriction in addition to it tax loss carryforwards charter also ha tax basis of billion in intangible asset and billion in property plant and equipment of december the tax basis in these asset is not subject to section limitation and therefore is currently deductible depreciated or amortized for illustrative purpose charter expects to reflect tax deductible amortization and depreciation on asset owned of december of approximately billion in and billion between through decelerating annually the foregoing projected deduction do not include any amortization or depreciation related to future capital spend or potential acquisition in addition the deduction assume charter doe not dispose of material portion of it business make modification to the underlying partnership it owns or create new underlying partnership all of which may materially affect the timing or amount of it existing amortization and depreciation deduction any one of these factor including pending transaction future legislation or adjustment by the irs upon examination could also affect the projected deduction in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized in our evaluation of the need for valuation allowance we take into account various factor including the expected level of future taxable income available tax planning strategy and reversal of existing taxable temporary difference due to our history of loss we were unable to assume future taxable income in our analysis and accordingly valuation allowance have been established against the gross deferred tax asset for book accounting purpose except for future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary difference for which deferred tax liability are recognized our gross deferred tax asset have been offset with corresponding valuation allowance of billion at december the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable and therefore reflected in the consolidated balance sheet would be increased at such time that it is more likely than not future taxable income will be realized during the carryforward period we periodically evaluate the fact and circumstance surrounding this assessment and at the time this consideration is met an adjustment to reverse some portion of the existing valuation allowance would result of december we have recorded net deferred income tax liability of billion largely attributable to the characterization of franchise for financial reporting purpose indefinite lived in contemplation of the twc transaction charter ha performed preliminary analysis of the valuation allowance recorded on charter preexisting deferred tax asset considering the interaction of the tax position of the acquiring and acquired entity in the twc transaction based on this analysis certain of the deferred tax liability that are anticipated to be recognized in connection with the close of the twc transaction are expected to reverse and provide source of future taxable income resulting in reduction of substantially all of charter preexisting valuation allowance associated with it deferred tax asset such release of charter valuation allowance would be recognized directly to income tax benefit on the consolidated statement of operation this preliminary analysis is subject to the finalization of the acquisition and the full assessment of the fact and circumstance surrounding the possible source of future taxable income after the close of the twc transaction determining our tax provision for financial reporting purpose charter establishes reserve for uncertain tax position unless such position are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merit in evaluating whether tax position ha met the more likely than not recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information tax position that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statement the tax position is measured the largest amount of benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether position taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained charter adjusts it

estimate the fair value of franchise right at the date of acquisition and determines if the franchise ha finite life or an indefinite life all franchise that qualify for indefinite life treatment are

assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired then no further quantitative testing is necessary in completing the qualitative impairment testing the company evaluates the impact of various factor to the expected future cash flow attributable to it unit of accounting and to the assumed discount rate which would be

of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such asset and therefore did not perform quantitative analysis periodically the company will elect to perform quantitative analysis if the company elect or is required to perform quantitative analysis to test it franchise asset for impairment the company determines the estimated fair value of franchise utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flow attributable to each of the intangible asset identified assuming discount rate the fair value of franchise for impairment testing is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flow using assumption consistent with internal forecast the franchise after tax cash flow is calculated the after tax cash flow generated by the potential customer obtained le the anticipated churn for the potential customer the sum of the present value of the franchise after tax cash flow in year through and the continuing value of the after tax cash flow beyond year yield the fair value of the franchise this approach make use of unobservable factor such projected revenue expense capital expenditure customer trend and discount rate applied to the estimated cash flow the determination of the franchise discount rate is derived from the company weighted average cost of capital which us market participant cost of equity and after tax cost of debt and reflects the risk inherent in the cash flow the company estimate discounted future cash flow using reasonable and appropriate assumption including among others penetration rate for video high speed internet and voice revenue growth rate operating margin and capital expenditure the assumption are based on the company and it peer historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factor surrounding the cable industry the estimate and assumption made in the company valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainty many of which are beyond it control and there is no assurance that these result can be achieved the primary assumption for which there is reasonable possibility of the occurrence of variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumption regarding revenue growth programming expense growth rate the amount and timing of capital expenditure actual customer trend and the discount rate utilized goodwill is tested for impairment of november of each year or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance accounting guidance also permit an optional qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value if after this qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary if the company elect or is required to perform the two step test under the accounting guidance the first step involves comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment is not necessary if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed and comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to it carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment if any the fair value of the reporting unit when performing the second step of the goodwill impairment test is determined using both an income approach and market approach the company income approach model used for it goodwill valuation is consistent with that used for it franchise valuation noted above except that cash flow from the entire business enterprise are used for the goodwill valuation the market approach model estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on market price in actual precedent transaction of similar business and market valuation of guideline public company with the company franchise impairment testing in the company elected to perform qualitative goodwill impairment assessment and concluded that goodwill is not impaired customer relationship are recorded at fair value of the date acquired le accumulated amortization customer relationship for valuation purpose represent the value of the business relationship with existing customer le the anticipated customer churn and are calculated by projecting the discrete future after tax cash flow from these customer including the right to deploy and market additional service to these customer the present value of these after tax cash flow yield the fair value of the customer relationship the use of different valuation assumption or definition of franchise or customer relationship such our inclusion of the value of selling additional service to our current customer within customer relationship versus franchise could significantly impact our valuation and any resulting impairment customer relationship are amortized on an accelerated sum of year digit method over useful life of year based on the period over which current customer are expected to generate cash flow the company periodically evaluates the remaining useful life of it customer relationship to determine whether event or circumstance warrant revision
