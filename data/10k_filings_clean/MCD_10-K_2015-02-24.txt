change in customer perception and guest count disruption in our operation or price volatility in market can also result from governmental action such price foreign exchange or import export control increased tariff government mandated closure of our or our supplier operation and asset seizure the cost and disruption of responding to governmental investigation or action whether or not they have merit may impact our result our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategy and brand building initiative to reduce our exposure to such governmental action our result of operation and financial condition are also affected by fluctuation in currency exchange rate which may adversely affect reported earnings additionally we face challenge and uncertainty associated with operating in developing market which may entail relatively higher risk of political instability economic volatility crime corruption and social and ethnic unrest for example our result have been negatively impacted by the ongoing event in the ukraine and russia such challenge are exacerbated in many case by lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in local law is applied and enforced including in area most relevant to commercial transaction and foreign investment if we are unable to effectively manage the risk associated with our international operation it could have material adverse effect on our business and financial condition challenge with respect to talent management could harm our business our success depends in part on our system ability to

restaurant and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third party supplier additionally we are keenly aware of and working to manage the risk and cost to our franchisees and our supply chain of the effect of climate change greenhouse gas energy and water resource the increased public focus including by governmental and non governmental organization on these and other

estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based upon the company consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the the preparation of these financial statement requires the company to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well related disclosure on an ongoing basis the company evaluates it estimate and judgment based on historical experience and various other factor that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result may differ from these estimate under various assumption or condition the company review it financial reporting and disclosure practice and accounting policy quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment the company belief that of it significant accounting policy the following involve higher degree of judgment and or complexity property and equipmentproperty and equipment are depreciated or amortized on straight line basis over their useful life based on management estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue not to exceed lease term plus option for leased property the useful life are estimated based on historical experience with similar asset taking into account anticipated technological or other change the company periodically review these life relative to physical factor economic factor and industry trend if there are change in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological change occur more rapidly than anticipated the useful life assigned to these asset may need to be shortened resulting in the accelerated recognition of depreciation and amortization expense or write offs in future period share based compensationthe company ha share based compensation plan which authorizes the granting of various equity based incentive including stock option and restricted stock unit rsus to employee and nonemployee director the expense for these equity based incentive is based on their fair value at date of grant and generally amortized over their vesting period the fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using closed form pricing model the pricing model requires assumption which impact the assumed fair value including the expected life of the stock option the risk free interest rate expected volatility of the company stock over the expected mcdonald corporation annual report and the expected dividend yield the company us historical data to determine these assumption and if these assumption change significantly for future grant share based compensation expense will fluctuate in future year the fair value of each rsu granted is equal to the market price of the company stock at date of grant le the present value of expected dividend over the vesting period long lived asset impairment reviewlong lived asset including goodwill are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter and whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in assessing the recoverability of the company long lived asset the company considers change in economic condition and make

estimate can be significantly impacted by many factor including change in global and local business and economic condition operating cost inflation competition and consumer and demographic trend key assumption impacting estimated future cash flow is the estimated change in comparable sale if the company estimate or underlying assumption change in the future the company may be required to record

determination of the amount of accrual required if any for these contingency is made aftercareful analysis of each matter the required accrual may change in the future due to new development in each matter or change in approach such change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matter the company doe not believe that any such matter currently being reviewed will have material adverse effect on it financial condition or result of operation income taxesthe company record valuation allowance to reduce it deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred asset will not be realized while the company ha considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategy including the sale of appreciated asset in assessing the need

expensive by inflation mcdonald corporation annual reportreconciliation of return on incremental invested capitalroiic is measure reviewed by management over one year and three year time period to evaluate the overall profitability of our market the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital this measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rate to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation the numerator is the company incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period the denominator is the weighted average cash used for investing activity during the applicable one or three year period the weighted average cash used for investing activity is based on weighting applied on quarterly basis these weighting are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter investing activity to incremental operating income for example fourth quarter investing activity are weighted le because the asset purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income of fourth quarter investing activity are included in the one year and three year calculation in contrast fourth quarter is heavily weighted because the asset purchased were deployed more than month ago and therefore have full year impact on operating income with little or no impact to the base period and of fourth quarter investing activity are included in the one year and three year calculation respectively cash used for investing activity can vary significantly by quarter resulting in weighted average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the period presented management belief that weighting cash used for investing activity provides more accurate reflection of the relationship between it investment and return than simple average the reconciliation to the most comparable measurement in accordance with accounting principle generally
