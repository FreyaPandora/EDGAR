economic slowdown and government restriction on movement other macroeconomic factor also remain dynamic and any cause of market size contraction such greater political unrest or instability in the middle east central and eastern europe including the ongoing russia ukraine war certain latin american market the hong kong market in greater china and the korean peninsula could reduce our sale or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flow change in cost our cost are subject to fluctuation particularly due to change in commodity price transportation cost other broader inflationary impact and our own productivity effort we have significant exposure to certain commodity in particular certain oil derived material like resin and paper based material like pulp volatility in the market price of these commodity input material ha direct impact on our cost disruption in our manufacturing supply and distribution operation including energy shortage port

currency have weakened versus the dollar leading to lower sale and earnings from these foreign exchange impact certain country that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuation include argentina turkey brazil and russia these fluctuation have significantly impacted our historical net sale cost and net earnings and could do so in the future increased pricing in response to certain fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate may offset portion of the currency impact but could also have negative impact on the consumption of our product which would

to the daily life of consumer the pandemic ha not had materially negative impact to our consolidated net sale net earnings and cash flow however the continued evolution of the pandemic may result in economic recession or slowdown of economic growth in certain country or region it could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our product due to governmental action or key material transportation and labor shortage impacting our ability to produce and ship product or could impact consumer movement and access to our product there could also be reduced demand due to consumption decrease and consumer pantry destocking particularly in home cleaning health and hygiene product economic activity resume following slowdown or relaxation of governmental restriction net the

trend due to resurgence of positive case and governmental action in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility and negative impact to net sale net earnings and cash flow during and subsequent to the pandemic while we have been able to broadly maintain our operation we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain market due primarily to the restriction of employee movement key material and labor shortage and transportation constraint we intend to continue to work with our supplier and government authority to implement employee safety measure to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our product the continued evolution of the pandemic and uncertainty with regard to the disruption caused either by resurgence of positive case or governmental action in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operation for example the closure of key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of key material or transportation supplier to source and transport material the pandemic ha not had material negative impact on the company liquidity position we continue to

uncertainty to how the war will evolve what it duration will be and it ultimate resolution within ukraine there is possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facility we may not be able to operate our manufacturing site and source raw material from our supplier or ship finished product to our customer ultimately these could result in impairment of our manufacturing plant and fixed asset or write down of other operating asset and working capital within russia we may not be able to continue our reduced operation at current level due to sanction and counter sanction monetary currency or payment control restriction on access to financial institution and supply and transportation challenge our supplier distributor and retail customer are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operation could also impact our operation or negatively impact the sale of our product more broadly there could be additional negative impact to our net sale earnings and cash flow should the situation escalate beyond it current scope including among other potential impact economic recession in certain neighboring country or globally due to inflationary pressure and supply chain cost increase or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of europe for additional information on risk factor that could impact our result please refer to risk factor in part item of this form result of operationsthe key metric included in the discussion of our consolidated result of operation include net sale gross margin selling general and administrative cost sg operating margin other non operating item income tax and net earnings the primary factor driving year over year change in net sale include overall market growth in the category in which we compete product initiative competitive activity the level of initiative pricing and other activity by competitor marketing spending retail execution both in store and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive change in our underlying unit volume well our pricing action which can also impact volume change in product and geographic mix and foreign exchange impact on sale outside the for most of our category our cost of product sold and sg are variable in nature to some extent accordingly our discussion of these operating cost focus primarily on relative margin rather than the absolute year over year change in total cost the primary driver of change in gross margin are input cost energy and other commodity pricing impact geographic mix for example gross margin in north america are generally higher than the company average for similar product product mix for example the beauty segment ha higher gross margin than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuation in situation where certain input cost may be tied to different functional currency than the underlying sale the impact of manufacturing saving project and reinvestments for example product or package improvement and to lesser extent scale impact for cost that are fixed or le variable in nature the primary component of sg are marketing related cost and non manufacturing overhead cost marketing related cost are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiency while overhead cost are variable to some extent we generally experience more scale related impact for these cost due to our ability to leverage our organization and system infrastructure to support business growth the main driver of change in sg percentage of net sale are overhead and marketing cost saving reinvestments for example increased advertising inflation foreign exchange

accounting policy used within the reportable segment to gaap the most notable ongoing reconciling item is income tax which adjusts the blended statutory rate that are reflected in the reportable segment to the overall company effective tax rate corporate net sale increased to million in fiscal due to an increase in the net sale of the incidental business managed at the corporate level corporate net earnings improved by million to million in fiscal due primarily to the prior year loss on the early debt extinguishment current year gain on the divestiture of minor business net sale

incidental business restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savingsthe company ha historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of to million saving generated from the company restructuring program are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activity the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment in fiscal the company incurred before tax restructuring cost within the range of our historical annual ongoing level of to million restructuring accrual of million of june are classified current liability approximately of the restructuring charge incurred in fiscal either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policy for ongoing restructuring type activity the resulting charge are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting in addition to our restructuring program we have additional ongoing saving effort in our supply chain marketing and overhead area that yield additional benefit to our operating margin cash flow financial condition and liquiditywe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operation and to readily access capital market at competitive rate operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating need and capital expenditure excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividend other discretionary us include share repurchase and acquisition to complement our portfolio of business brand and geography necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activity the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business result and global cash management strategy that take into account liquidity management economic factor and tax consideration cash flow analysis million cash provided by operating activity net cash provided used by investing activity net cash used in financing

cash flow summarized below an increase in account receivable used million of cash primarily due to sale growth the number of day the procter gamble company outstanding increased approximately day versus prior year higher inventory used billion of cash due to business growth and increased safety stock level to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth and commodity cost increase inventory day on hand increased approximately day primarily due to these same factor account payable accrued and other liability generated billion of cash account payable increased in line with the increase in inventory and to lesser extent the impact of extended payment term with supplier see extended payment term and supply chain financing below partially offset by lower marketing spending day payable outstanding increased approximately day versus prior year due to these same factor other net operating asset and liability used million of cash primarily driven by the current portion of transitional tax payment due related to the tax act and pension related contribution partially offset by other impact adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow an important non gaap measure because it is factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividend share repurchase acquisition and other discretionary investment it is defined operating cash flow le capital expenditure and excluding payment for the transitional tax resulting from the tax act adjusted free cash flow is one of the measure used to evaluate senior management and determine their at risk compensation adjusted free cash flow wa billion in decrease of versus the prior year the decrease wa primarily driven by the decrease in operating cash flow discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings wa in extended payment term and supply chain financing beginning in fiscal in response to evolving market practice the company began program to negotiate extended payment term with it supplier at the same time the company initiated supply chain finance program the scf with number of global financial institution the scf bank under the scf qualifying supplier may elect to sell their receivables from the company to scf bank these participating supplier negotiate their receivables sale arrangement directly with the respective scf bank while the company is not party to those agreement the scf bank allow the participating supplier to utilize the company creditworthiness in establishing credit spread and associated cost this generally provides the supplier with more favorable term than they would be able to secure on their own the company ha no economic interest in supplier decision to sell receivable qualifying supplier elect to participate in the scf and reach an agreement with an scf bank they elect which individual company invoice they sell to the scf bank however all the company payment to participating supplier are paid to the scf bank on the invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pay the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoice that were not previously sold to the scf bank under the scf the term of the company payment obligation are not impacted by supplier participation in the scf our payment term with our supplier for similar service and material within individual market are consistent between supplier that elect to participate in the scf and those that do not participate accordingly our average day outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of supplier or related input cost that are included in the scf in addition the scf is available to both material supplier where the underlying cost are largely included in cost of good sold and to service supplier where the underlying cost are largely included in sg of june approximately of our global supplier have elected to participate in the scf payment to those supplier during fiscal year total approximately billion which equal approximately of our total cost of good sold and sg for the year for participating supplier we believe substantially all of their receivables with the company are sold to the scf bank accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date similar proportion of amount originally due to supplier would instead be payable to scf bank all outstanding amount related to supplier participating in the scf are recorded within account payable in our consolidated balance sheet and the associated payment are included in operating activity within our consolidated statement of cash flow of june and the amount due to supplier participating in the scf and included in account payable were approximately billion and billion respectively although difficult to project due to market and other dynamic we anticipate incremental cash flow benefit from the extended payment term with supplier could increase at slower rate in fiscal future change in our supplier financing policy or economic development such change in interest rate general market liquidity or the company credit worthiness relative to participating supplier could impact supplier participation in the scf and or our ability to negotiate extended payment term with our supplier however any such impact are difficult to predict investing cash flownet investing activity used billion of cash in primarily due to capital spending and acquisition net investing activity used billion in cash in mainly due to capital

liquidityat june our current liability exceeded current asset by billion largely due to short term borrowing under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our short term liquidity and operating need largely through cash generated from operation the company regularly ass it cash need and the available source to fund these need of june the company had billion of cash and cash equivalent related to foreign subsidiary primarily in various western european and asian country we not have material cash and cash equivalent related to any country subject to exchange control that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the fund under current law we do not expect restriction or tax on repatriation of cash held outside of the to have material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the result of operation for the foreseeable future we utilize short and long term debt to fund discretionary item such acquisition and share repurchase we have strong short and long term debt rating which have enabled and should continue to enable to refinance our debt it becomes due at favorable rate in commercial paper and bond market in addition we have agreement with diverse group of financial institution that if needed should provide sufficient funding to meet short term financing requirement on june our short term credit rating were moody and standard poor while our long term credit rating were moody and aa standard poor all with stable outlook we maintain bank credit facility to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an billion facility split between billion five year facility and billion day facility which expire in november and november respectively both facility can be extended for certain period of time specified in the term of the credit agreement these facility are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facility do not have cross default or rating trigger nor do they have material adverse event clause except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facility we have an automatically effective registration statement on form filed with the sec that is available for registered offering of short or long term debt security for additional detail on debt see note to the consolidated financial statement guarantee and other balance sheet arrangementswe do not have guarantee or other off balance sheet financing arrangement including variable interest entity which we believe could have material impact on our financial

yearsafter yearsrecorded liabilitiestotal debt tax act transitional charge otherinterest payment relating to long term pension funding purchase obligation contractual commitment represents the federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provision of the tax act represents future pension payment to comply with local funding requirement these future pension payment assume the company continues to meet it future statutory funding requirement considering the current economic environment in which the company operates the company belief it cash flow are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirement the projected payment beyond fiscal year are not currently determinable primarily reflects future contractual payment under various take or pay arrangement entered into part of the normal course of business commitment made under take or pay obligation represent minimum commitment with supplier and are in line with expected usage this includes service contract for information technology human resource management and facility management activity that have been outsourced while the amount listed represent contractual obligation we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contract were canceled prior to maturity in such case we generally are able to negotiate new contract or cancellation penalty resulting in reduced payment the amount do not include other contractual purchase obligation that are not take or pay arrangement such contractual purchase obligation are primarily purchase order at fair value that are part of normal operation and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trend we do not believe such purchase obligation will adversely affect our liquidity position significant accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our financial statement in accordance with gaap there are certain accounting policy that may require choice between acceptable accounting method or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income tax certain employee benefit and goodwill and intangible asset we believe these accounting policy and others set forth in note to the consolidated financial statement should be reviewed they are integral to understanding the result of operation and financial condition of the company the company ha discussed the selection of significant accounting policy and the effect of estimate with the audit committee of the company board of director revenue recognitionour revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customer those sale predominantly contain single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at single point in time when ownership risk and reward transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotion consisting primarily of customer pricing allowance in store merchandising fund advertising and other promotional activity and consumer coupon are offered through various program to customer and consumer sale are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized incurred at the time of the sale amount accrued for trade promotion at the end of period require estimation based on contractual term sale volume and historical utilization and redemption rate the actual amount paid may be different from such estimate these difference which have historically not been significant are recognized change in management estimate in subsequent period income taxesour annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rate and the tax impact of item treated differently for tax purpose than for financial reporting purpose also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgement and assumption regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balance primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax position realization of net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward period which involves business plan planning opportunity and expectation about future outcome although realization is not assured management belief it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance will be realized we operate in multiple jurisdiction with complex tax policy and regulatory environment in certain of these jurisdiction we may take tax position that management belief are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational difference with the respective the procter gamble companygovernmental taxing authority can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profit are earned in line with the business substance and function of the various legal entity in the jurisdiction where those function are performed however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concept we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer price for our various cross border transaction we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance ruling with tax authority to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance ruling reduces this uncertainty with respect to over of our global earnings we evaluate our tax position and establish liability in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income tax we review these tax uncertainty considering changing fact and circumstance such the progress of tax audit and adjust them accordingly we have several audit in process in various jurisdiction although the resolution of these tax position is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcome will not have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation or cash flow because there are several estimate and assumption inherent in calculating the various component of our tax provision certain future event such change in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audit or earnings repatriation plan could have an impact on those estimate and our effective tax rate see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on the company income tax employee benefitswe sponsor various postretirement benefit throughout the world these include pension plan both defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan and other postretirement benefit oprb plan consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retiree for accounting purpose the defined benefit pension and oprb plan require assumption to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligation including the following variable discount rate expected salary increase certain employee related factor such turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on asset and health care cost trend rate these and other assumption affect the annual expense and net obligation recognized for the underlying plan our assumption reflect our historical experience and management best judgment regarding future expectation permitted by gaap the net amount by which actual result differ from our assumption is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds of the greater of plan asset or liability portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan change such increasing or decreasing benefit for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employee expected to receive benefit the expected return on plan asset assumption impact our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plan and our primary oprb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rate of return is described in note to the consolidated financial statement for the average return on asset assumption for pension plan asset and oprb asset wa and respectively change in the rate of return of basis point for both pension and oprb asset would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million since pension and oprb liability are measured on discounted basis the discount rate impact our plan obligation and expense discount rate used for our defined benefit pension and oprb plan are based on yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality bond for which the timing and amount of cash outflow approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plan the discount rate are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bond rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plan of represents weighted average of local rate in country where such plan exist basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million the average discount rate on the oprb plan of reflects the higher interest rate generally applicable in the which is where most of the plan participant receive benefit basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after tax oprb expense by approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on our defined benefit pension and oprb plan goodwill and intangible assetssignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting unit and intangible asset accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialist for significant goodwill reporting unit and intangible asset the fair value estimate are based on available historical information and on future expectation we typically estimate the fair value of these asset using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flow attributable to the respective asset the valuation used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible asset for impairment are dependent on number of significant estimate and assumption including macroeconomic condition overall category growth rate competitive activity cost containment and margin progression company business plan and the discount rate applied to cash flow indefinite lived intangible asset and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset occurs during the month ended december assumption used in our impairment evaluation such forecasted growth rate and cost of the procter gamble company are consistent with internal projection and operating plan we believe these estimate and assumption are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participant unanticipated market or macroeconomic event and circumstance may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimate and assumption for example future change in the judgment assumption and estimate that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset including discount and tax rate or future cash flow projection could result in significantly different estimate of the fair value in addition change to or failure to achieve business plan or deterioration of macroeconomic condition could result in reduced cash flow or higher discount rate leading to lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible asset of these business we test individual indefinite lived intangible asset by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible asset if the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible is le than it carrying value that difference represents an impairment determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible asset are expected to have indefinite life based on their history and our plan to continue to support and build the acquired brand other acquired intangible asset certain brand all customer relationship patent and technology are expected to have determinable useful life our assessment to brand that have an indefinite life and those that have determinable life is based on number of factor including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycle operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the country in which the brand are sold determinable lived intangible asset are amortized to expense over their estimated life an impairment assessment for determinable lived intangible is only required when an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable most of our goodwill reporting unit are comprised of combination of legacy and acquired business and result have fair value cushion that at minimum exceed three time their underlying carrying value certain of our goodwill reporting unit in particular shave care and appliance are comprised entirely of acquired business and result have fair value cushion that are not high our legacy business the appliance reporting unit ha fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value based on our annual impairment testing during the three month ended december the shave care reporting unit fair value exceeded it carrying value by more than and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset fair value exceeded it carrying value by approximately the most significant assumption utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset are the net sale and earnings growth rate including residual growth rate and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter term business planning period the residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimate is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plan and approximates expected long term category market growth rate the residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rate the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rate and business activity that impact market share result the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit change devaluation of currency against the dollar or an increased competitive environment the discount rate which is consistent with weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participant is based upon industry required rate of return including consideration of both debt and equity component of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse change in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt market or other country specific factor such further devaluation of currency against the dollar spot rate of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimate for cash flow outside the another key assumption in our fair value determination of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is the royalty rate which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying gillette business the royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse change in long term operating margin while management can and ha implemented strategy to address these event in the past change in operating plan or adverse change in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flow used to estimate fair value and could result in decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charge of the shave care reporting unit goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset the duration and severity of the pandemic and the russia ukraine war could result in slow down or recession or drive inflationary pressure or foreign currency devaluation in the general economy these could trigger additional future impairment charge for the shave care reporting unit goodwill and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset while we have concluded that triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended june the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk our assessment of the gillette intangible asset assumes the net sale growth rate will continue to recover from the impact of the pandemic there continues to be high level of uncertainty relating to geopolitical and macroeconomic factor result of the russia ukraine war and the covid pandemic accordingly there the procter gamble companycontinues to be risk related to this key assumption the continued evolution of the pandemic and the russia ukraine war could impact the assumption utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment net sale and earnings growth rate could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reduction or change in demand for our shave care product which may be caused by among other thing the temporary inability of consumer to purchase our product due to illness quarantine or other travel restriction financial hardship change in the use and frequency of grooming product or by shift in demand away from one or more of our higher priced product to lower priced product or by disruption in the supply chain or operation due to the evolving russia ukraine war in addition relative global and country regional macroeconomic factor including the russia ukraine war could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other country currency relative to the dollar finally the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by change in the underlying interest rate and risk premium included in the determination of the cost of capital of june the carrying value of the shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset were billion and billion respectively we performed sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing utilizing reasonably possible change in the assumption for the shorter term and residual growth rate the discount rate and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impact to the estimated fair value the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impact related to basis point increase in the discount rate basis point decrease in our shorter term and residual growth rate or basis point decrease in our royalty rate some of which would result in an impairment of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset approximate percent change in estimated fair value bps discount rate bpsgrowth rate bps royalty rateshave care goodwill reporting unit agillette indefinite lived intangible asset in light of the russia ukraine war we performed an additional sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset for range of outcome including reduced future cash flow and no future cash flow in ukraine and russia under these scenario the shave care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed it carrying value by approximately and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset fair value exceeded or approximated it carrying value however if the impact of the war were to extend beyond it current scope there could be triggering event for the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset that may cause to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset in future period that may result in an impairment charge see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional discussion on goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing result new accounting pronouncementsrefer to note to the consolidated financial statement for recently adopted accounting pronouncement and recently issued accounting pronouncement not yet adopted of june other informationhedging and derivative financial instrumentsas multinational company with diverse product offering we are exposed to market risk such change in interest rate currency exchange rate and commodity price we evaluate exposure on centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting we leverage the company diversified portfolio of exposure natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activity over financial market instrument to the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operation discussed below we enter into various financial transaction which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instrument and hedging activity these financial transaction are governed by our policy covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument type and other hedging practice see note to the consolidated financial statement for discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instrument derivative position are monitored using technique including market valuation sensitivity analysis and value at risk modeling the test for interest rate currency rate and commodity derivative position discussed below are based on the riskmanager value at risk model using one year horizon and confidence level the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposure move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instrument and assumes that financial return are normally distributed estimate of volatility and correlation of market factor are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset of june in case where data is unavailable in riskmetrics reasonable proxy is included our market risk exposure relative to interest rate currency rate and commodity price discussed below have not changed materially versus the previous reporting period in addition we are not aware of any fact or circumstance that would significantly impact such exposure in the near term interest rate exposure on financial instrument interest rate swap are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligation certain interest rate swap denominated in foreign currency are designated to hedge exposure to currency exchange rate movement on the procter gamble company investment in foreign operation these currency interest rate swap are designated hedge of the company foreign net investment based on our interest rate exposure of and during the year ended june including derivative and other instrument sensitive to interest rate we believe near term change in interest rate at confidence level based on historical interest rate movement would not materially affect our financial statement currency rate exposure on financial instrument because we manufacture and sell product and finance operation in number of country throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expense of movement in currency exchange rate corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operation we primarily use forward contract and currency swap with maturity of le than month based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instrument of and during the year ended june we believe at confidence level based on historical currency rate movement the impact on such instrument of near term change in currency rate would not materially affect our financial statement commodity price exposure on financial instrument we use raw material that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply condition political and economic variable and other unpredictable factor we may use
