consolidated financial statement for which actual result will emerge over long period of time this includes the recoverability of long lived asset employed in the business including asset of acquired business these estimate and assumption are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted circumstance warrant for instance expected asset life may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group goodwill totaled approximately billion of december annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year impairment testing for goodwill is done at reporting unit level with all goodwill assigned to reporting unit reporting unit are one level below the business segment level can be combined when reporting unit within the same segment have similar economic characteristic at reporting unit generally correspond to division not combine any of it reporting unit for impairment testing an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit net asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by price earnings ratio for comparable industry group or by using discounted cash flow analysis typically us the price earnings ratio approach for stable and growing business that have long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flow us the discounted cash flow approach for start up loss position and declining business in addition to business where the price earnings ratio valuation method indicates additional review is warranted also us discounted cash flow an additional tool for business that may be growing at slower rate than planned due to economic or other condition described in note effective in the third quarter of within the health care business segment the company formed the oral care solution division which combined the former espe and unitek division for any product move that resulted in reporting unit change the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact on goodwill of the associated reporting unit during the third quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time of october had primary reporting unit with ten reporting unit accounting for approximately percent of the goodwill these ten reporting unit were comprised of the following division purification which table of content includes the polypore separation medium acquisition advanced material communication market display material and system health information system industrial adhesive and tape infection prevention oral care solution personal safety which includes the capital safety acquisition and traffic safety and security the estimated fair value for these reporting unit were in excess of carrying value by approximately percent or more except for one reporting unit with approximately million of goodwill where the fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately percent market value at both september and december wa significantly in excess of it equity of approximately billion at both december and september in primarily used an industry price earnings ratio approach but also used discounted cash flow approach for certain reporting unit to determine fair value where applicable used weighted average discounted cash flow analysis for certain division using projected cash flow that were weighted based on different sale growth and terminal value assumption among other factor the weighting wa based on management estimate of the likelihood of each scenario occurring is an integrated material enterprise thus many of business could not easily be sold on stand alone basis focus on research and development ha resulted in portion of value being comprised of internally developed business that have no goodwill associated with them based on the annual test in the fourth quarter of no goodwill impairment wa indicated for any of the reporting unit factor which could result in future impairment charge include among others change in worldwide economic condition change in competitive condition and customer preference and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate these risk factor are discussed in item risk factor of this document in addition change in the weighted average cost of capital could also impact impairment testing result indicated above during the third quarter of the company completed it assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit impacted by change between reporting unit and determined that no impairment existed long lived asset with definite life are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset asset group may not be recoverable if future non cash asset impairment charge are taken would expect that portion of the long lived asset or goodwill would be impaired will continue to monitor it reporting unit and asset group in for any triggering event or other indicator of impairment income tax the extent of operation involves dealing with uncertainty and judgment in the application of complex tax regulation in multitude of jurisdiction the final tax paid are dependent upon many factor including negotiation with taxing authority in various jurisdiction and resolution of dispute arising from federal state and

are measured at fair value on recurring basis and nonrecurring basis under the standard fair value is defined the exit price or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date the standard also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the hierarchy is broken down into three level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability level input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input are unobservable input for the asset or

financial result however existing provision that prohibited an entity from reporting discontinued operation if it had certain continuing cash flow or involvement with the component after disposal were eliminated by this standard the asu also expands the disclosure for discontinued operation and requires new disclosure related to individually significant disposal that do not qualify discontinued operation for this asu wa effective prospectively beginning january this asu wa applied to the divestiture information discussed in note and had no material impact on consolidated result of operation and financial condition in may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer and in august issued asu no which amended asu no to effective date the asu amended provides single comprehensive model to be used in the accounting for revenue arising from contract with customer and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance including industry specific guidance the standard stated core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised good or service to customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or service to achieve this core principle the asu includes provision within five step model that includes identifying the contract with customer identifying the performance obligation in the contract determining the transaction price allocating the transaction price to the performance obligation and recognizing revenue when or an entity satisfies performance obligation the standard also specifies the accounting for some cost to obtain or fulfill contract with customer and requires expanded disclosure about revenue recognition

expect this asu to have material impact on consolidated result of operation and financial condition in may the fasb issued asu no disclosure for investment in certain entity that calculate net asset value per share or it equivalent this standard modifies existing disclosure requirement such that investment for which the practical expedient is used to measure their fair value at net asset value nav would be removed from the fair value hierarchy disclosure instead an entity would be required to include those investment reconciling item such that the total fair value amount of investment in the fair value hierarchy disclosure is consistent with the amount on the balance sheet change were also made to the requirement in sponsor employee benefit plan asset disclosure for this standard is effective january with early adoption permitted the company adopted this asu in the fourth quarter of with retrospective application to prior period result note pension and postretirement benefit plan

replacement cost or nrv le an approximately normal profit margin when measuring inventory for this standard is effective prospectively beginning january with early adoption permitted the company is currently assessing this asu impact on consolidated result of operation and financial condition in september the fasb issued asu no simplifying the accounting for measurement period adjustment that eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in business combination to account for measurement period adjustment retrospectively under existing standard an acquirer in business combination report provisional amount with respect to acquired asset and liability when their measurement are incomplete of the end of the reporting period prior to the impact of this asu an acquirer is required to adjust provisional amount and the related impact on earnings by restating prior period financial statement during the measurement period which can not exceed one year from the date of acquisition the new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustment including the impact on prior period be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified eliminating the requirement to restate prior period financial statement the new standard requires disclosure of the nature and amount of measurement period adjustment well information with respect to the portion of the adjustment recorded in current period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting period if the adjustment to provisional amount had been recognized of the acquisition date the asu is applied prospectively to measurement period adjustment that occur after the effective date for this standard is required prospectively beginning january with early adoption

liability of the december measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plan which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumption the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liability could be effectively settled at the end of the year the company set it rate to reflect the yield of portfolio of high quality fixed income debt

measurement date the standard also establishes hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from source independent of the company unobservable input are input that reflect the company assumption about the factor market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstance the hierarchy is broken down into three level level input are quoted price unadjusted in active market for identical asset or liability level input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest

property and commercial claim and lawsuit including those brought under the antitrust law and environmental proceeding unless otherwise stated the company is vigorously defending all such litigation process for disclosure and recording of liability and insurance receivables related to legal proceeding many lawsuit and claim involve highly complex issue relating to causation scientific evidence and whether there are actual damage and are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainty assessment of lawsuit and claim can involve series of complex judgment about future event and can rely heavily on estimate and assumption the company complies with the requirement of asc contingency and related guidance and record liability for legal proceeding in those instance where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is range the company record the most likely estimate of the loss or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate the company either discloses the amount of possible loss or range of loss in excess of established accrual if estimable or state that such an estimate can not be made the company discloses significant legal proceeding even where liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both if the company belief there is at least reasonable possibility that loss may be incurred the company estimate insurance receivables based on an analysis of it numerous policy including their exclusion pertinent case law interpreting

where the company ha not taken an accrual because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable or both but where the company ha incurred an expense in defending itself the company record receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling or development could occur there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charge in excess of presently recorded liability future adverse ruling settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charge that could have material adverse effect on the company result of operation or cash flow in the period in which they are recorded although the company can not estimate it exposure to all legal proceeding it currently belief that such future charge if any would not have material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company based on experience and development the company reexamines it estimate of probable liability and associated expense and receivables each period and whether it is able to estimate liability previously determined to be not estimable and or not probable where appropriate the company make addition to or adjustment of it estimated liability result the current estimate of the potential impact on the company consolidated

legal proceeding in which the company is involved and then describe the liability and associated insurance receivables the company ha accrued relating to it significant legal proceeding table of content respirator mask asbestos litigation of december the company is named defendant with multiple co defendant in numerous lawsuit in various court that purport to represent approximately individual claimant compared to approximately individual claimant with action pending at december the vast majority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the company mask and respirator product and seek damage from the company and other defendant for alleged personal injury from workplace exposure to asbestos silica coal mine dust or other occupational dust found in product manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace minority of the lawsuit and claim resolved by and currently pending against the company generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from product previously manufactured by the company which are often unspecified well product manufactured by other defendant or occasionally at company premise the company current volume of new and pending matter is substantially lower than it experienced at the peak of filing in the company expects that filing of claim by unimpaired claimant in the future will continue to be at much lower level than in the past accordingly the number of claim alleging more serious injury including mesothelioma and other malignancy will represent greater percentage of total claim than in the past the company ha prevailed in all ten case taken to trial including eight of the nine case tried to verdict such trial occurred in and and an appellate reversal in of the jury verdict adverse to the company the remaining case tried in wa dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiff evidence based on the court legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support jury verdict the company ha demonstrated in these past trial proceeding that it respiratory protection product are effective claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstance consequently the company belief that claimant are unable to establish that their medical condition even if significant are attributable to the company respiratory protection product nonetheless the company litigation experience indicates that claim of person with malignant condition are costlier to resolve than the claim of unimpaired person and it therefore belief the average cost of resolving pending and future claim on per claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior period when the vast majority of claim were asserted by the unimpaired previously reported the state of west virginia through it attorney general filed complaint in against the company and two other manufacturer of respiratory protection product in the circuit court of lincoln county west virginia and amended it complaint in the amended complaint seek substantial but unspecified compensatory damage primarily for reimbursement of the cost allegedly incurred by the state for worker compensation and healthcare benefit provided to all worker with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damage the case ha been inactive since the fourth quarter of other than case management conference in march in november the state filed motion to bifurcate the lawsuit into separate liability and damage proceeding at the hearing on the motion the court declined to bifurcate the lawsuit no liability ha been recorded for this matter because the company belief that liability is not probable and estimable at this time in addition the company is not able to estimate possible loss or range of loss given the lack of any meaningful discovery response by the state of west virginia the otherwise minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claim against two other manufacturer where defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault if any jury might allocate to each defendant if the case is ultimately tried respirator mask asbestos liability and insurance receivables the company estimate it respirator mask asbestos liability including the cost to

the respirator mask asbestos litigation of december the company had accrual for respirator mask asbestos liability of million excluding aearo accrual this accrual represents the low end in range of loss the company can not estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amount by which the liability may exceed the accrual the company ha established because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted or the time period in which future claim may be asserted ii the complaint nearly always assert claim against multiple defendant where the damage alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendant that defendant share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability which can vary by state iii the multiple factor

manufactured by other defendant or generally in the workplace of december the company through it aearo subsidiary had accrual of million for product liability and defense cost related to current and future aearo related asbestos and silica related claim responsibility for legal cost well for settlement and judgment is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo cabot american optical corporation and subsidiary of warner lambert and their respective insurer the payor group liability is allocated among the party based on the number of year each company sold respiratory product under the ao safety brand and or owned the ao safety division of american optical corporation and the alleged year of exposure of the individual plaintiff aearo share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july this agreement provides that so long aearo pay to cabot table of content quarterly fee of cabot will retain responsibility and liability for and indemnify aearo against any product liability claim involving exposure to asbestos silica or silica product for respirator sold prior to july because of the difficulty in determining how long particular respirator remains in the stream of commerce after being sold aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claim arising out of the alleged use of respirator involving exposure to asbestos silica or silica product prior to january with these arrangement in place aearo potential liability is limited to exposure alleged to have arisen from the use of respirator involving exposure to asbestos silica or silica product on or after january to date aearo ha elected to pay the quarterly fee aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claim for some part of the pre july period covered by it agreement with cabot if aearo elect to discontinue it participation in this arrangement or if cabot is no longer able to meet it obligation in these matter in march cabot csc corporation

change in the liability allocation among the co defendant viii the financial viability of member of the payor group including exhaustion of available insurance coverage limit and or ix determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligation on which aearo ha estimated it share of liability is inaccurate the company can not determine the impact of these potential development on it current estimate of aearo share of liability for these existing and future claim if any of the development described above were to occur the actual amount of these liability for existing and future claim could be significantly larger than the amount accrued because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claim that have not yet been asserted the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claim among the payor group and the several possible development that may occur that could affect the estimate of aearo liability the company can not estimate the amount or range of amount by which aearo liability may exceed the accrual the company ha established environmental matter and litigation the company operation are subject to environmental law and regulation
