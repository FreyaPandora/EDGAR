factor in order to increase our responsiveness to our customer and to improve our sale and customer retention our marketing organization also manages and directs several sale channel including direct sale on line outbound telemarketing and store programming we believe that offering wide variety of video programming choice influence customer decision to subscribe and retain our cable video service we obtain basic and premium programming usually pursuant to written contract from number of supplier although medium consolidation ha resulted in fewer supplier and additional selling power on the part of programmer supplier our programming contract generally continue for fixed period of time usually for multiple year and are subject to negotiated renewal programming is usually made available to for license fee which is generally paid based on the number of customer to we make that programming available programming license fee may include volume discount and financial incentive to support the launch of channel and or ongoing marketing support well discount for channel placement or service penetration for home shopping channel we typically receive percentage of the revenue attributable to our customer purchase we also offer vod and pay per view channel of movie and event that are subject to revenue split with the content provider our programming cost have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increase we expect programming cost to continue to increase due to variety of factor including annual increase pursuant to our programming contract contract renewal with programmer and the carriage of incremental programming including new service and vod programming increase in the cost of sport programming and the amount paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributor to the growth in our programming cost over the last few year additionally the demand of large medium company who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase of their le popular network ha limited our flexibility in creating more tailored and cost sensitive programming package for consumer finally programmer have experienced decline in demand for advertising advertiser shift more of their marketing spend online we believe that this is resulting in programmer demanding higher programming fee from they seek to recover revenue they are losing to online advertising federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission continuing demand by owner of broadcast station for cash payment at substantial increase over amount paid in prior year in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming cost or require to cease carriage of popular programming potentially leading to loss of customer in affected market over the past several year increase in our video service rate have not fully offset increasing programming cost and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factor we not expect them to do in the foreseeable future although we pas along portion of amount paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customer our inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our video customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with our video product in order to mitigate reduction of our operating margin due to rapidly increasing programming cost we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy we have programming contract that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of we will seek to renegotiate the term of these agreement there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may in the future be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer operate in geographically diverse area which are organized in regional cluster these region are managed centrally on consolidated level our eleven region and the customer relationship within each region of december are follows in thousand region total customer relationshipscarolinas lake

attract the same advertiser we compete for advertising revenue against among others local broadcast station national cable and broadcast network radio station print medium and online advertising company and content provider and home management our intelligenthome service face competition from traditional security company such the adt corporation service provider such verizon and at well new entrant such vivint inc alarm com inc and nest lab inc which google acquired in seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation market our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising our capital expenditure and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth network program specific project and construction regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our three primary service for both residential and commercial customer video internet and voice service cable system operation are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do so in the future we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new regulation or regulatory action that do not equally impact our key competitor we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future in addition we are already subject to charter specific condition regarding certain business practice result of the fcc approval of the transaction video servicemust carry retransmission consentthere are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster alternatively federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession popular station invoking retransmission consent have been demanding substantial compensation increase in their recent negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost additional government mandated broadcast carriage obligation could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer service that appeal to our customer and generate revenue cable equipmentin congress enacted statute requiring the fcc to adopt regulation designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for navigation device such cable set top box result the fcc required cable operator to make separate offering of security module cablecard that can be used with retail navigation device some of the fcc rule requiring support for cablecards were vacated by the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia in and another of these rule wa repealed by congress in but the basic obligation to provide separable security for retail device remains in place in the fcc proposed to replace it cablecard regime with burdensome new rule that would have required to make disaggregated information flow available to set top box and apps supplied by third party that proposal wa not adopted but various party may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approach to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set top box it remains uncertain whether the fcc or congress will change the legal requirement related to our set top box and what the impact of any such change might be and information security regulationthe communication act limit our ability to collect use and disclose subscriber personally identifiable information for our video voice and internet service well provides requirement to safeguard such information we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer subscriber and employee information the fcc federal trade commission ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of communication service provider including telemarketing and online marketing effort the fcc recently adopted privacy rule that contain new restriction affecting the use of broadband and voice customer data and various other federal agency including the ftc continue to provide updated guidance on the use and protection of consumer data our operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security including new reasonable data security requirement set forth in the fcc recently adopted privacy rule which will become effective on march in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc ha recently used the existing authority under it privacy and security requirement for telecommunication service to bring enforcement action against several company for failing to protect customer data from unauthorized access by and disclosure to third party resulting in substantial monetary settlement similarly the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation several state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business various security standard provide guidance to telecommunication company in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk one such standard is the voluntary framework released by the national institute for standard and technology nist in february in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure the nist cybersecurity framework provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business it wa designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc which is also considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement we can not predict what proposal may be adopted or how new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business mdus inside wiringthe fcc ha adopted series of regulation designed to spur competition to established cable operator in mdu complex these regulation allow our competitor to access certain existing cable wiring inside mdus the fcc also adopted regulation limiting the ability of established cable operator like to enter into exclusive service contract for mdu complex in their current form the fcc regulation in this area favor our competitor pole attachmentsthe communication act requires most utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and simultaneously subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation in and again in the fcc amended it existing pole attachment rule to promote broadband deployment the order allows for new penalty in certain case involving unauthorized attachment but generally strengthens the cable industry ability to access investor owned utility pole on reasonable rate term and condition additionally the order reduces the federal rate formula previously applicable to telecommunication attachment to closely approximate the rate formula applicable to cable attachment the order continues the reconciliation of rate effectively closing the remaining loophole that potentially allowed for significantly higher rate for telecommunication than for cable attachment in certain scenario utility pole owner have appealed the order neither the order the order directly affect the rate in state that self regulate rather than allow the fcc to regulate pole rate but many of those state have substantially the same rate for cable and telecommunication attachment although the and order do not impact the status quo treatment of cable provided voip service an unclassified service eligible for the favorable cable rate the issue ha not been fully resolved by the fcc and potential change in classification in pending proceeding could adversely impact our pole attachment rate in state or for period of time in which the cable rate is or wa lower than the telecommunication rate additionally although the fcc reclassification of broadband internet access telecommunication service also set forth the fcc intention that pole rate not increase result that reclassification ruling could adversely impact our pole attachment rate in state or for period of time in which the cable rate is or wa lower than the telecommunication rate rate regulationfederal law strictly limit the potential scope of cable rate regulation pursuant to federal law all video offering are universally exempt from rate regulation except for cable system minimum level of video programming service referred to basic service and associated equipment rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to federal formula with local government commonly referred to local franchising authority primarily responsible for administering this regulation the majority of our local franchising authority have never certified to regulate basic service cable rate in the fcc adopted an order which is now under appeal reversing it historic approach to rate regulation certification and requiring local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rate to first make an affirmative showing that there is no effective competition defined under federal law in the community few local franchise authority have filed the necessary rate regulation certification and the fcc order should make it more difficult for such entity to assert rate regulation in the future there have been call to impose expanded rate regulation on the cable industry confronted with rapidly increasing cable programming cost it is possible that congress may adopt new constraint on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming any such constraint could adversely affect our operation ownership restrictionsfederal regulation of the communication field traditionally included host of ownership restriction which limited the size of certain medium entity and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprise through series of legislative regulatory and judicial action most of these restriction have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed change in this regulatory area could alter the business environment in which we operate access channelslocal franchise agreement often require cable operator to set aside certain channel for public educational and governmental access programming federal law also requires cable system to designate up to of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party who may offer programming that our customer do not particularly desire the fcc adopted revised rule in mandating significant reduction in the rate that operator can charge commercial leased access user and imposing additional administrative requirement that would be burdensome on the cable industry the effect of the fcc revised rule wa stayed by federal court pending cable industry appeal and an adverse finding by the office of management and budget although commercial leased access activity historically ha been relatively limited increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable system other fcc regulatory mattersfcc regulation cover variety of additional area including among other thing equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical service standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming licensing of system and facility maintenance of public file emergency alert system and disability access including new requirement governing video description and closed captioning each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system in the future and we can not predict at this time how that might impact our business copyrightcable system are subject to federal copyright compulsory license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signal the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming copyright clearance for non broadcast programming service are arranged through private negotiation cable operator also must obtain music right for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing right organization these licensing fee have been the source of litigation in the past and we can not predict with certainty whether license fee dispute may arise in the future mattersour cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise permit and similar authorization granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way cable franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction cable franchise generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard supporting and carrying public access channel and change in the ownership of the franchisee number of state subject cable system to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agency such public utility commission although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law cap local franchise fee prior to the scheduled expiration of our franchise we generally initiate renewal proceeding with the granting authority the communication act of amended the communication act which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communication provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authority may not unreasonably withhold renewal in connection with the franchise renewal process however many governmental authority require the cable operator to make additional costly commitment historically we have been able to renew our franchise without incurring significant cost although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable term or otherwise if we fail to obtain renewal of franchise representing significant number of our customer it could have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or our liquidity including our ability to comply with our debt covenant similarly if local franchising authority consent is required for the purchase or sale of cable system the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent the traditional cable franchising regime ha undergone significant change result of various federal and state action the fcc ha adopted rule that streamline entry for new competitor particularly those affiliated with telephone company and reduce certain franchising burden for these new entrant the fcc adopted more modest relief for existing cable operator at the same time substantial number of state have adopted new franchising law again these law were principally designed to streamline entry for new competitor and they often provide advantage for these new entrant that are not immediately available to existing cable operator in many instance these franchising regime do not apply to established cable operator the existing franchise expires or competitor directly enters the franchise territory the exact nature of these state franchising law and their varying application to new and existing video provider will impact our franchising obligation and our competitive position internet servicefcc regulation subject broadband internet access service to certain regulation intended to ensure that end user can send and receive lawful internet content without discrimination by internet service provider such under these rule provider of broadband internet access service are not permitted to block access to or restrict data rate for downloading lawful content or ban the attachment of non harmful device to our service except to the extent required by reasonable network management practice internet service provider are also not permitted to give special priority to the transmission of content from our affiliate or accept payment from third party to give special priority their content furthermore internet service provider are subject to general obligation not to take action that unreasonably interfere with the ability of end user such our subscriber and edge provider such web site to exchange data with each other the fcc ha also stated that it will investigate problem that may arise regarding interconnection of the network of retail broadband internet access provider with upstream provider of internet connectivity in addition the fcc rule require that we meet certain transparency obligation that we disclose material technical and other term and condition applicable to our internet service these fcc regulation were upheld by the circuit in june but remain subject to additional appeal we can not predict how those ongoing appeal will be resolved moreover it is possible that congress or the fcc will modify or repeal the existing regulation we can not predict how the fcc will enforce it regulation in particular case or whether in the future the fcc may seek to expand the scope of it regulatory obligation on internet access service provider in addition to the regulatory obligation noted above provider of broadband internet access service are obliged by the communication assistance for law enforcement act calea to configure their network in manner that facilitates the ability of law enforcement with proper legal authorization to obtain information about our customer including the content of their internet communication the fcc and congress also are considering subjecting internet access service to the universal service funding requirement these funding requirement could impose significant new cost on our internet service also the fcc and some state regulatory commission direct certain subsidy to telephone company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved we have opposed such subsidy when directed to area that we serve despite our effort future subsidy may be directed to area served by which could in subsidized competitor operating in our service territory state and local governmental organization have also adopted internet related regulation these various governmental jurisdiction are also considering additional regulation in these and other area such privacy pricing service and product quality and taxation the adoption of new internet regulation or the adaptation of existing law to the internet could adversely affect our business aside from the fcc generally applicable regulation we have made certain commitment to comply with the fcc order in connection with the fcc approval of the twc transaction and the bright house transaction discussed above the fcc is considering whether online video distributor ovds that offer programming to customer with broadband internet connection should be classified multichannel video programming distributor mvpds and thereby subject to the program access protection available to mvpds well some of the regulatory requirement applicable to mvpds the outcome of this proceeding which could impact how ovds compete in the future with traditional cable service can not be determined at the current time voice servicethe telecommunication act of created more favorable regulatory environment for to provide telecommunication and or competitive voice service than had previously existed in particular it established requirement ensuring that competitive telephone company could interconnect their network with those provider of traditional telecommunication service to open the market to competition the fcc ha subsequently ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnection with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market since that time the fcc ha initiated proceeding to determine whether such interconnection right should extend to traditional and competitive network utilizing ip technology and how to encourage the transition to ip network throughout the industry new rule or obligation arising from these proceeding may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service the fcc ha collected extensive data from provider of point to point transport special access service such and the fcc may use that data to evaluate whether the market for such service is competitive or whether the market should be subject to further regulation which may increase our cost or constrain our ability to compete in this market the fcc also recently selected new national local number portability administrator and the change to that new administrator may adversely impact our ability to manage number porting and related task further regulatory change are being considered that could impact our voice business and that of our primary telecommunication competitor the fcc and state regulatory authority are considering for example whether certain common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carrier should be modified or reduced and the extent to which common carrier requirement should be extended to voip provider the fcc ha already determined that certain provider of voice service using internet protocol technology must comply with requirement relating to emergency service the calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information issue number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee and discontinuance of service in november the fcc adopted an order imposing limited back up power obligation on provider of facility based fixed residential voice service that are not otherwise line powered including our voip service this order became effective in february and requires to disclose certain information to customer and to make back up power available at the point of sale in march federal appeal court affirmed the fcc decision concerning federal regulation of certain voip service but declined to specifically find that voip service provided by cable company such we provide should be regulated only at the federal level result some state have begun proceeding to subject cable voip service to state level regulation and at least one state ha asserted jurisdiction over our voip service we have filed legal challenge to that state assertion of jurisdiction which is now pending before federal district court in minnesota although we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure the continuity of our service and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangement it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved related commitment in connection with approval of the transaction federal and state regulator imposed number of post merger condition on including but not limited to the following fcc condition offer settlement free internet interconnection to any party that meet the requirement of our interconnection policy available on charter website on term generally consistent with the policy for seven year with possible reduction to five deploy and offer high speed broadband internet access service to an additional two million location over five year at least one million of which must be in area outside our footprint that face competition from another high speed internet provider refrain from charging usage based price or imposing data cap on any fixed mass market broadband internet access service plan for seven year with possible reduction to five offer mbps discounted broadband where technically feasible to eligible customer throughout our service area for four year from the offer commencement and continue to provide cablecards to any new or existing customer upon request for use in third party retail device for four year and continue to support such cablecards for seven year in each case unless the fcc change the relevant rule the fcc condition also contain number of compliance reporting requirement doj conditionsthe department of justice doj order prohibits from entering into or enforcing any agreement with video programmer that forbids limit or creates incentive to limit the video programmer provision of content to ovds we will not be able to avail ourself of other distributor most favored nation mfn provision if they are inconsistent with this prohibition the doj condition are effective for seven year although we may petition the doj to eliminate the condition after five year state conditionscertain state regulator including california new york hawaii and new jersey also imposed condition in connection with the approval of the transaction these condition include requirement related to upgrading network within the designated state including upgrade to broadband speed and conversion of all household served within california and new york to an all

complying with reporting requirement employee of december we had approximately active full time equivalent employee at december approximately of our employee were represented by collective bargaining agreement we believe we have good relation with our employee including those represented by collective bargaining agreement item risk factor risk related to the integration of the transactionsif we are not able to successfully integrate our business with that of legacy twc and legacy bright house within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated cost saving and other benefit of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or take longer to realize than expected in such circumstance we may not perform expected and the value of charter class common stock may be adversely affected until the closing of the transaction legacy charter legacy twc and legacy bright house operated independently and there can be no assurance that their business can be integrated successfully we now have significantly more system asset investment business customer and employee than each company prior to the transaction it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key charter employee the loss of customer the disruption of our ongoing business or in unexpected integration issue higher than expected integration cost and an overall post completion integration process that take longer than originally anticipated the process of integrating legacy twc and legacy bright house with the legacy charter operation will require significant capital expenditure and the expansion of certain operation and operating and financial system management will be required to devote significant amount of time and attention to the integration process and there is significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process these difficulty include integrating the company operation and corporate function integrating the company technology network and customer service platform integrating and unifying the product offering and service available to customer including customer premise equipment and video user interface harmonizing the company operating practice employee development and compensation program internal control and other policy procedure and process maintaining existing relationship and agreement with customer provider

digital for the legacy twc and legacy bright house system and attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquired asset even if the new business are successfully integrated it may not be possible to realize the benefit that are expected to result from the transaction or realize these benefit within the time frame that is expected for example the elimination of duplicative cost may not be possible or may take longer than anticipated or the benefit from the transaction may be offset by cost incurred or delay in integrating the business and increased operating cost if the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefit from the transaction our liquidity result of operation financial condition and or share price may be adversely affected in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management and resource may be focused on the integration of the business and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt the business of the combined company if the operating result of legacy twc and or legacy bright house are le than our expectation or an increase in the capital expenditure to upgrade and maintain those asset well to keep pace with technological development are greater than expected we may not achieve the expected level of financial result from the transaction we will derive portion of our continuing revenue and earnings per share from the operation of legacy twc and legacy bright house therefore any negative impact on these company or the operating result derived from such company could harm the combined company operating result our business and the business of legacy twc and legacy bright house are characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new product and service we intend to make investment in the combined business and transition toward only using two way all digital set top box the increase in capital expenditure necessary for the transition toward two way set top box in the business may negatively impact the expected financial result from the transaction the combined company may not be able to fund the capital expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development execute the plan to do so or anticipate the demand of it customer for product and service requiring new technology or bandwidth our inability to maintain expand and upgrade our existing or combined business could materially adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation the transaction were accounted for an acquisition in accordance with accounting

to it compliance with the term of it credit facility and restriction under applicable law twc llc and twce ability to make distribution to charter cco holding or charter operating to service debt obligation is subject to restriction under applicable law see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data under the delaware limited liability company act the act our subsidiary may only make distribution if the relevant entity ha surplus defined in the act under fraudulent transfer law our subsidiary may not pay dividend if the relevant entity is insolvent or is rendered insolvent thereby the measure of insolvency for purpose of these fraudulent transfer law vary depending upon the law applied in any proceeding to determine whether fraudulent transfer ha occurred generally however an entity would be considered insolvent if the sum of it debt including contingent liability wa greater than the fair saleable value of all it asset the present fair saleable value of it asset wa le than the amount that would be required to pay it probable liability on it existing debt including contingent liability they become absolute and mature or it could not pay it debt they became due we believe that our relevant subsidiary currently have surplus and are not insolvent however these subsidiary may become insolvent in the future our direct or indirect subsidiary include the borrower and guarantor under the charter operating credit facility and note under the cco holding note and under the twc llc and twce note of december our total principal amount of debt wa approximately billion in the event of bankruptcy liquidation or dissolution of one or more of our subsidiary that subsidiary asset would first be applied to satisfy it own obligation and following such payment such subsidiary may not have sufficient asset remaining to make payment to it parent company an equity holder or otherwise in that event the lender under charter operating credit facility and note and any other indebtedness of our subsidiary whose interest are secured by substantially all of our operating asset and all holder of other debt of charter operating cco holding twc llc and twce will have the right to be paid in full before from any of our subsidiary asset some of our outstanding debt is subject to change of control provision we may not have the ability to raise the fund necessary to fulfill our obligation under our indebtedness following change of control which would place in default under the applicable debt instrument we may not have the ability to raise the fund necessary to fulfill our obligation under our note and our credit facility following change of control under the indenture governing the cco holding note upon the occurrence of specified change of control event the debt issuer is required to offer to repurchase all of it outstanding note however we may not have sufficient access to fund at the time of the change of control event to make the required repurchase of the applicable note and charter operating is limited in it ability to make distribution or other payment to any debt issuer to fund any required repurchase in addition change of control under the charter operating credit facility would result in default under those credit facility which would trigger default under the indenture governing the cco holding note the charter operating note and the twc llc and twce note because such credit facility and note are obligation of charter operating and it subsidiary the credit facility would have to be repaid before charter operating asset could be available to cco holding to repurchase their note any failure to make or complete change of control offer would place cco holding in default under their note the failure of our subsidiary to make change of control offer or repay the amount accelerated under their note and credit facility would place them in default under such agreement risk related to our business we operate in very competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden better access to financing greater personnel resource greater resource for marketing greater and more favorable brand name recognition and long established relationship with regulatory authority and customer increasing consolidation in the cable industry and the repeal of certain ownership rule have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale our residential video service face competition from number of source including direct broadcast satellite service well other company that deliver movie television show and other video programming over broadband internet connection to tv computer tablet and mobile device our residential internet service face competition from the phone company dsl ftth and wireless broadband offering well from variety of company that offer other form of online service including wireless and satellite based broadband service our residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone provider well other form of communication such text messaging on cellular phone instant messaging social networking service video conferencing and email competition from these company including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customer overbuilds could also adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation by creating or increasing competition we are aware of traditional overbuild situation impacting certain of our market however we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur our service may not allow to compete effectively competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including service requirement for additional information regarding the competition we face see business competition and regulation and legislation we face risk relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audience which ha intensified in part due to advance in technology and change in consumer expectation and behavior in addition to the various competitive factor discussed above we are subject to risk relating to increasing competition for the leisure time shifting consumer need and discretionary spending of consumer we compete with all other source of entertainment news and information delivery well broad range of communication product and service technological advancement such new video format and internet streaming and downloading of programming that can be viewed on television computer smartphones and tablet many of which have been beneficial to have nonetheless increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choice available to consumer and intensified the challenge posed by audience fragmentation newer product and service particularly alternative method for the distribution sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed further increasing the number of competitor that we face the increasing number of choice available to audience including low cost or free choice could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our product and service but also advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television network and station well other advertising platform such radio print and increasingly online medium our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technology and change in consumer expectation and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position and our business and result of operation our exposure to the economic condition of our current and potential customer vendor and third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to risk associated with the economic condition of our current and potential customer the potential financial instability of our customer and their financial ability to purchase our product if there were general economic downturn we may experience increased cancellation by our customer or unfavorable change in the mix of product purchased including an increase in the number of home that replace their video service with internet delivered and or over air content which would negatively impact our ability to attract customer increase rate and maintain or increase revenue in addition providing video service is an established and highly penetrated business our ability to gain new video subscriber is dependent to large extent on growth in occupied housing in our service area which is influenced by both national and local economic condition weak economic condition may also have negative impact on our advertising revenue these event have adversely affected in the past and may adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition if downturn were to occur in addition we are susceptible to risk associated with the potential financial instability of the vendor and third party on which we rely to provide product and service or to which we outsource certain function the same economic condition that may affect our customer well volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market also could adversely affect vendor and third party and lead to significant increase in price reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendor or third party upon which we rely any interruption in the service provided by our vendor or by third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we face risk inherent in our commercial business we may encounter unforeseen difficulty we increase the scale of our service offering to business we sell internet access data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular tower and office building video and business voice service to business and have increased our focus on growing this business in order to grow our commercial business we expect to continue investment in technology equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business commercial business customer often require service level agreement and generally have heightened customer expectation for reliability of service if our effort to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful the growth of our commercial service business would be limited we depend on interconnection and related service provided by certain third party for the growth of our commercial business result our ability to implement change the service grow may be limited if we are unable to meet these service level requirement or expectation our commercial business could be adversely affected finally we expect advance in communication technology well change in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment consequently we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future development in these area might have on our voice and commercial business and operation cost are rising at much faster rate than wage or inflation and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rate of or pas on to our customer our increasing programming cost which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin video programming ha been and is expected to continue to be our largest operating expense item in recent year the cable industry ha experienced rapid escalation in the cost of programming we expect programming cost to continue to increase because of variety of factor including amount paid for broadcast station retransmission consent annual increase imposed by programmer and carriage of incremental programming including new service and vod programming the inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product we have programming contract that have expired and others that will expire at or before the end of there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term three programmer have filed lawsuit against regarding which legacy programming arrangement apply after the closing of the transaction and there can be no assurance that other programmer will not bring similar suit in the future in addition number of programmer have begun to sell their service through alternative distribution channel which may cause those programmer to seek even higher programming fee from this may degrade security of their product increase their operating cost or reduce their advertising revenue to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may be in the future forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer our failure to carry programming that is attractive to our subscriber could adversely impact our customer level operation and financial result in addition if our internet customer are unable to access desirable content online because content provider block or limit access by our subscriber class our ability to gain and retain customer especially internet customer may be negatively impacted increased demand by owner of some broadcast station for carriage of other service or payment to those broadcaster for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming cost federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without the station permission in some case we carry station under short term arrangement while we attempt to negotiate new long term retransmission agreement if negotiation with these programmer prove unsuccessful they could require to cease carrying their signal possibly for an indefinite period any loss of station could make our video service le attractive to customer which could result in le subscription and advertising revenue in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result our inability to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we operate in highly competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technology to address consumer changing demand and distinguish our service from those of our competitor we may not be able to accurately predict technological trend or the success of new product and service if we choose technology or equipment that are le effective cost efficient or attractive to customer than those chosen by our competitor if we offer service that fail to appeal to consumer are not available at competitive price or that do not function expected or we are not able to fund the expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development our competitive position could deteriorate and our business and financial result could suffer the ability of some of our competitor to introduce new technology product and service more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position furthermore advance in technology decrease in the cost of existing technology or change in competitor product and service offering may require in the future to make additional research and development expenditure or to offer at no additional charge or at lower price certain product and service that we currently offer to customer separately or at premium in addition the uncertainty of our ability and the cost to obtain intellectual property right from third party could impact our ability to respond to technological advance in timely and effective manner the implementation of our network based user interface spectrum guide may ultimately be unsuccessful or more expensive than anticipated our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service such state of the art user interface in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer consequently our growth financial condition and result of operation could suffer materially depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we depend on limited number of third party service provider supplier and licensors to supply some of the service hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our service some of our hardware software and operational support vendor and service provider represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or result of intellectual property right position of some exclusivity if any of these party breach or terminates it agreement with or otherwise fails to perform it obligation in timely manner demand exceeds these vendor capacity they experience operating or financial difficulty they significantly increase the amount we pay for necessary product or service or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand profitability or change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner at our specification and at reasonable price our ability to provide some service might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative source of the affected material or service might delay our ability to serve our customer in addition the existence of only limited number of vendor of key technology can lead to le product innovation and higher cost these event could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customer and our operation business financial result and financial condition our cable system have historically been restricted to using one of two proprietary conditional access security system which we believe ha limited the number of manufacturer producing set top box for such system an alternative we developed new conditional access security system which can be downloaded into set top box with feature we specify that could be provided by variety of manufacturer we refer to our specified set top box our worldbox additionally we are developing technology to allow our two current proprietary conditional access security system to be software downloadable into our worldbox in order to realize the broadest benefit of our worldbox technology we must now complete the support for the downloadable proprietary conditional access security system within the worldbox we can not provide assurance that this implementation will ultimately be successful or completed in the expected timeframe or at the expected budget our business may be adversely affected if we can not continue to license or enforce the intellectual property right on which our business depends we rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law and license and other agreement with our employee customer supplier and other party to establish and maintain our intellectual property right in technology and the product and service used in our operation also because of the rapid pace of technological change we both develop our own technology product and service and rely on technology developed or licensed by third party however any of our intellectual property right could be challenged or invalidated or such intellectual property right may not be sufficient to permit to take advantage of current industry trend or otherwise to provide competitive advantage which could result in costly redesign effort discontinuance of certain product or service offering or other competitive harm we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain license from these third party on reasonable term if at all in addition claim of intellectual property infringement could require to enter into royalty or licensing agreement on unfavorable term incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question which could require to change our business practice or offering and limit our ability to compete effectively even unsuccessful claim can be time consuming and costly to defend and may divert management attention and resource away from our business in recent year the number of intellectual property infringement claim ha been increasing in the communication and entertainment industry and with increasing frequency we are party to litigation alleging that certain of our service or technology infringe the intellectual property right of others various event could disrupt our network information system or property and could impair our operating activity and negatively impact our reputation and financial result network and information system technology are critical to our operating activity both for our internal us such network management and supplying service to our customer including customer service operation and programming delivery network or information system shutdown or other service disruption caused by event such computer hacking dissemination of computer virus worm and other destructive or disruptive software cyber attack process breakdown denial of service attack and other malicious activity pose increasing risk both unsuccessful and successful cyber attack on company have continued to increase in frequency scope and potential harm in recent year while we develop and maintain system seeking to prevent system related event and security breach from occurring the development and maintenance of these system is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technique used in such attack become more sophisticated and change frequently we and the third party on which we rely may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure while from time to time attempt have been made to access our network these attempt have not yet resulted in any material release of information degradation or disruption to our network and information system network and information system are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outage telecommunication failure accident natural disaster including extreme weather arising from short term or any long term change in weather pattern terrorist attack and similar event further the impact associated with extreme weather or long term change in weather pattern such rising sea level or increased and intensified storm activity may cause increased business interruption or may require the relocation of some of our facility our system redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventuality any of these event if directed at or experienced by or technology upon which we depend could have adverse consequence on our network our customer and our business including degradation of service service disruption excessive call volume to call center and damage to our or our customer equipment and data large expenditure may be necessary to repair or replace damaged property network or information system or to protect them from similar event in the future moreover the amount and scope of insurance that we maintain against loss resulting from any such event or security breach may not be sufficient to cover our loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to our business that may result any such significant service disruption could result in damage to our reputation and credibility customer dissatisfaction and ultimately loss of customer or revenue any significant loss of customer or revenue or significant increase in cost of serving those customer could adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation furthermore our operating activity could be subject to risk caused by misappropriation misuse leakage falsification or accidental release or loss of information maintained in our information technology system and network and those of our third party vendor including customer personnel and vendor data we provide certain confidential proprietary and personal information to third party in connection with our business and there is risk that this information may be compromised result of the increasing awareness concerning the importance of safeguarding personal information the potential misuse of such information and legislation that ha been adopted or is being considered regarding the protection privacy and security of personal information information related risk are increasing particularly for business like that process store and transmit large amount of data including personal information for our customer we could be exposed to significant cost if such risk were to materialize and such event could damage our reputation credibility and business and have negative impact on our revenue we could be subject to regulatory action and claim made by consumer in private litigation involving privacy issue related to consumer data collection and use practice we also could be required to expend significant capital and other resource to remedy any such security breach the risk described above may be increased during the period in which we are integrating our people process and system result of the transaction for tax purpose charter could experience deemed ownership change in the future that could limit it ability to use it tax loss carryforwards charter had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion of december these loss resulted from the operation of charter communication holding company

loss carryforwards which existed at november for the first ownership change those that existed at may for the second ownership change and those created at may for the third ownership change the limitation on charter ability to use it loss carryforwards in conjunction with the loss carryforward expiration provision could reduce charter ability to use portion of it loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income which could result in charter being required to make material cash tax payment charter ability to make such income tax payment if any will depend at such time on it liquidity or it ability to raise additional capital and or on receipt of payment or distribution from charter holdco and it subsidiary if charter were to experience additional ownership change in the future result of purchase and sale of stock by it percent stockholder new issuance or redemption of our stock certain acquisition of it stock and issuance redemption or other disposition or acquisition of interest

the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technology customer and employee privacy and data security limited rate regulation of video service copyright royalty for retransmitting broadcast signal when cable system must carry particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry broadcast station the provision of

alert system disability access technical standard marketing practice customer service and consumer protection and approval for merger and acquisition often accompanied by the imposition of restriction and requirement on an applicant business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business for example with respect to our retail broadband internet access service the fcc ha reclassified the service title ii service applied certain existing title ii provision and associated regulation to it forborne from applying range of other existing title ii provision and associated regulation but to varying degree indicated that this forbearance may be only temporary and issued new rule expanding disclosure requirement and prohibiting blocking throttling paid prioritization and unreasonable interference with the ability of end user and edge provider to reach each other the order also subjected broadband provider internet traffic exchange rate and practice to potential fcc oversight for the first time and created mechanism for third party to file complaint regarding these matter these fcc action were upheld on appeal in june although additional appeal remain pending result of the reclassification of broadband internet access service title ii communication service the fcc adopted new privacy and data security rule for common carrier interconnected voip provider and broadband service provider on october the new rule replace the prior rule and extend broader privacy protection to broadband customer well voice service customer the new rule place heightened restriction on the use of customer information that internet service provider obtain from the provision of broadband internet access service including increased notice consumer choice and security and are more restrictive than other existing privacy and security framework the new rule are subject to additional regulatory approval and legal challenge change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on our business there are ongoing effort to amend or expand the federal state and local regulation of some of the service offered over our cable system which may compound the regulatory risk we already face for example the fcc recently issued proposal to impose regulation on our point to point transport service well other commercial data service business data service result the fcc may price regulate business data service common carriage service and impose additional restriction on contracting term the fcc also ha considered adopting new navigation device rule pursuant to section of the communication act which directs the fcc to assure the availability of navigation device such set top box from third party provider in the fcc proposed burdensome new rule that would have required to make disaggregated information flow available to set top box and apps supplied by third party that proposal ha not been adopted but various party may continue to advocate alternative regulatory approach to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set top box the fcc also is considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service including whether that service should be regulated under title ii congress is considering legislation that could increase cost on the company including the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business change in corporate tax law that could eliminate some of our current deduction and broadband subsidy to rural area that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our more rural facility if any of these pending law and regulation are enacted they could affect our operation and require significant expenditure we can not predict future development in these area and we are already subject to charter specific condition regarding certain internet practice result of the fcc approval of the transaction but any change to the regulatory framework for our internet or voip service could have negative impact on our business and result of operation it remains uncertain what rule change if any will ultimately be adopted by congress and the fcc and what operating or financial impact any such rule might have on including on our programming agreement customer privacy and the user experience in addition the fcc enforcement bureau ha been actively investigating certain industry practice of various company and imposing forfeiture for alleged regulatory violation our cable system franchise are subject to non renewal or termination the failure to renew franchise in one or more key market could adversely affect our business our cable system generally operate pursuant to franchise permit and similar authorization issued by state or local governmental authority controlling the public right of way many franchise establish comprehensive facility and service requirement well specific customer service standard and monetary penalty for non compliance in many case franchise are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provision set forth in the franchise agreement governing

operating proposal is considered inadequate franchise authority often demand concession or other commitment condition to renewal in some instance local franchise have not been renewed at expiration and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreement or without franchise while negotiating renewal term with the local franchising authority we can not assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provision of our franchise agreement and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreement additionally although historically we have renewed our franchise without incurring significant cost we can not assure you that we will be able to renew or to renew favorably our franchise in the future termination of or sustained failure to renew franchise in one or more key market could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area our cable system franchise are non exclusive accordingly local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise and create additional competition for our product resulting in overbuilds which could adversely affect result of operation our cable system franchise are non exclusive consequently local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise to competitor in the same geographic area or operate their own cable system in some case local government entity and municipal utility may legally compete with on more favorable term potential competitor like google have recently pursued and obtained local franchise that are more favorable than the incumbent operator franchise the fcc ha adopted rule that streamline entry for new competitor particularly those affiliated with telephone company and reduce franchising burden for these new entrant at the same time substantial number of state have adopted new franchising law principally designed to streamline entry for new competitor and often provide advantage for these new entrant that are not immediately available to existing operator delivery of video content is not necessarily subject to the same franchising obligation applicable to our traditional cable system the fcc administers program that collect universal service fund contribution from telecommunication service provider and us them to subsidize the provision of telecommunication service in high cost area and to low income consumer and the provision of internet and telecommunication service to school library and certain health care provider variety of regulatory change may lead the fcc to expand the collection of universal service fund contribution to encompass internet service provider the fcc already ha begun to redirect the expenditure of some universal service fund subsidy to broadband deployment in way that could assist competitor local franchise authority have the ability to impose additional regulatory constraint on our business which could further increase our expense in addition to the franchise agreement cable authority in some jurisdiction have adopted cable regulatory ordinance that further regulate the operation of cable system this additional regulation increase the cost of operating our business local franchising authority may impose new and more restrictive requirement local franchising authority who are certified to regulate rate in the community where they operate generally have the power to reduce rate and order refund on the rate charged for basic service and equipment tax legislation and administrative initiative or challenge to our tax position could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we operate cable system in location throughout the united state and result we are subject to the tax law and regulation of federal state and local government from time to time various legislative and or administrative initiative may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax position there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payment will not be adversely affected by these initiative certain state and locality have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional tax or fee on our service or changing the methodology or base on which certain fee and tax are computed potential change include additional tax or fee on our service which could impact our customer combined reporting and other change to general business tax central unit level assessment of property tax and other matter that could increase our income franchise sale use and or property tax liability in addition federal state and local tax law and regulation are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretation there can be no assurance that our tax position will not be challenged by relevant tax authority or that we would be successful in any such challenge further regulation of the cable industry could impair our ability to raise rate to cover our increasing cost resulting in increased loss currently rate regulation of cable system is strictly limited to the basic service tier and associated equipment and installation activity and the fcc recently revised it rule in response to changed market condition to make it more difficult for local franchising authority to assert rate regulation authority however the fcc and congress continue to be concerned that cable rate increase are exceeding inflation it is possible that either the fcc or congress will further restrict the ability of cable system operator to implement rate increase for our video service or even for our internet and voice service should this occur it would impede our ability to raise our rate if we are unable to raise our rate in response to increasing cost our financial result would be adversely impacted there ha been legislative and regulatory interest in requiring company that own multiple cable network to make each of them available on standalone rather than bundled basis to cable operator and in requiring cable operator to offer historically bundled programming service on an la carte basis to consumer while any new regulation or legislation designed to enable cable operator to purchase programming on standalone basis could be beneficial to any regulation or legislation that limit how we sell programming could adversely affect our business change in channel carriage regulation could impose significant additional cost on cable operator also face significant regulation of their video channel carriage we can be required to devote substantial capacity to the carriage of programming that we might not carry voluntarily including certain local broadcast signal local public educational and governmental access peg programming and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming required channel capacity for use by person unaffiliated with the cable operator who desire to distribute programming over cable system the fcc adopted revised commercial leased access rule which would dramatically reduce the rate we can charge for leasing this capacity and dramatically increase our administrative burden but these remain stayed while under appeal legislation ha been introduced in congress in the past that if adopted could impact our carriage of broadcast signal by eliminating the cable industry compulsory copyright license the fcc also continues to consider change to the rule affecting the relationship between programmer including broadcaster and multichannel video distributor including potential loosening of medium ownership rule regulatory change could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity increase our programming cost and limit our ability to offer service that would maximize our revenue potential it is possible that other legal restraint will be adopted limiting our discretion over programming decision our voice service is subject to regulatory burden which may increase causing to incur additional cost we offer voice communication service over our broadband network using voip service the fcc ha ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnect with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market the scope of these interconnection right are being reviewed in current fcc proceeding which may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service or result in additional cost the fcc ha also declared that certain voip service are not subject to traditional state public utility regulation the full extent of the fcc preemption of state and local regulation of voip service is not yet clear and at least one state minnesota ha asserted jurisdiction over the company voip service we have filed legal challenge to that jurisdictional assertion which is now pending before federal district court in minnesota telecommunication company generally are subject to other significant regulation which could also be extended to voip provider the fcc ha already extended certain traditional telecommunication carrier requirement to many voip provider such if additional telecommunication regulation are applied to our voip service it could cause to incur additional cost item unresolved

accompanying note thereto of charter communication inc and subsidiary included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data overviewwe are the second largest cable operator in the united state and leading broadband communication service company providing video internet and voice service to approximately million residential and business customer at december in addition we sell video and online advertising inventory to local regional and national advertising customer and fiber delivered communication and managed it solution to larger enterprise customer we also own and operate regional sport network and local sport news and community channel and sell security and home management service to the residential marketplace see part item business product and service for further description of these service including customer statistic for different service since legacy charter ha actively invested in it network and operation and improved the quality and value of the product and package that legacy charter offered through the roll out of spectrum pricing and packaging we have simplified our offer and improved our packaging of product delivering more value to new and existing customer further through the transition of our legacy charter market to our all digital platform we increased our offering to more than hd channel in most of the legacy charter market and offered internet speed of at least or mbps among other benefit we believe that this product set combined with improved customer service we insource our workforce in our call center and in our field operation ha led to lower customer churn and longer customer lifetime result of the transaction revenue increased by over billion year over year we also saw an increase in expense related to our increased scale in september we began launching spp to legacy twc market and we expect that by mid we will offer spp in all legacy twc and legacy bright house market in we intend to begin converting the remaining legacy twc and legacy bright house analog market to an all digital platform our corporate organization well our marketing sale and product development department are now centralized field operation are managed through eleven regional area each designed to represent combination of designated marketing area and managed with largely the same set of field employee that were with the three legacy company prior to completion of the transaction over multi year period legacy twc and legacy bright house customer care center will migrate to legacy charter model of using segmented virtualized based in house call center we will focus on deploying superior product and service with minimal service disruption we integrate our information technology and network operation we expect customer and financial result to trend similar to legacy charter following the implementation of the legacy charter operating strategy across the legacy twc and legacy bright house market result of implementing our operating strategy at legacy twc and legacy bright house we can not be certain that we will be able to grow revenue or maintain our margin at recent historical rate the company realized revenue adjusted ebitda and income from operation during the period presented follows in million all percentage are calculated using whole number minor difference may exist due to rounding year ended december growth over over revenue adjusted ebitda income from operation pro forma revenue adjusted ebitda income from operation adjusted ebitda is defined consolidated net income loss plus net interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization stock compensation expense loss on extinguishment of debt gain loss on financial instrument net other income expense net and other operating income expense such merger and restructuring cost other pension benefit special charge and gain loss on sale or retirement of asset see use of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow for further information on adjusted ebitda and free cash flow growth in total revenue adjusted ebitda and income from operation wa primarily due to the transaction on pro forma basis assuming the transaction occurred of january total revenue growth wa primarily due to growth in our internet and commercial business on pro forma basis adjusted ebitda growth wa primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial revenue offset by increase in programming cost and other operating cost in addition to the factor discussed above income from operation on pro forma basis wa affected by increase in depreciation and amortization merger and restructuring cost and stock compensation expense approximately and of our revenue for year ended december and respectively are attributable to monthly subscription fee charged to customer for our video internet voice and commercial service provided by our cable system generally these customer subscription may be discontinued by the customer at any time subject to fee for commercial customer the remaining and of revenue for fiscal year and respectively is derived primarily from advertising revenue franchise and other regulatory fee revenue which are collected by but paid to local authority pay per view and vod programming installation processing fee or reconnection fee charged to customer to commence or reinstate service and commission related to the sale of merchandise by home shopping service we incurred the following transition cost in connection with the transaction in million year ended december expense operating expense expense expenditure included in transition operating expense and transition capital expenditure represent incremental cost incurred to integrate the legacy twc and legacy bright house operation and to bring the three company system and process into uniform operating structure cost are incremental and would not be incurred absent the integration other operating expense associated with the transaction represent merger and restructuring cost and include advisory legal and accounting fee employee retention cost employee termination cost and other exit cost interest expense associated with the transaction represents interest incurred on the cco safari ii cco safari iii and ccoh safari note issued in advance of the closing of the transaction the proceeds of which were held in escrow to finance the transaction we have history of net loss our net loss were principally attributable to insufficient revenue to cover the combination of operating expense interest expense that we incur on our debt depreciation expense resulting from the capital investment we have made and continue to make in our cable property amortization expense related to our customer relationship intangible and higher non cash income tax expense we will incur significant increase in interest expense and depreciation and amortization result of the transaction and will incur restructuring and transition cost for at least one to two year and result absent non recurring impact such the reversal of the income tax valuation allowance in the second quarter of we may incur net loss in the future critical accounting policy and estimate certain of our accounting policy require our management to make difficult subjective and or complex judgment management ha discussed these policy with the audit committee of charter board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed the following disclosure we consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the estimate assumption and judgment that are involved in preparing our financial statement and the uncertainty that could affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow property plant and equipment capitalization of labor and overhead cost valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment useful life of property plant and equipment intangible asset valuation and impairment of franchise valuation and impairment of goodwill valuation and impairment and amortization of customer relationship income tax litigation programming agreement pension plansin addition there are other item within our financial statement that require estimate or judgment that are not deemed critical such the allowance for doubtful account and valuation of our financial instrument but change in estimate or judgment in these other item could also have material impact on our financial statement plant and equipmentthe cable industry is capital intensive and large portion of our resource are spent on capital activity associated with extending rebuilding and upgrading our cable network of december and the net carrying amount of our property plant and equipment consisting primarily of cable distribution system wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent respectively total capital expenditure for the year ended december and were approximately billion billion and billion respectively capitalization of labor and overhead cost cost associated with network construction initial placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the initial placement of outlet within dwelling along with the cost associated with the initial deployment of customer premise equipment necessary to provide video internet or voice service are capitalized cost capitalized include material direct labor and certain indirect cost these indirect cost are associated with the activity of personnel who assist in installation activity and consist of compensation and overhead cost associated with these support function while our capitalization is based on specific activity once capitalized we track these cost on composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation the cost of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from dwelling and the cost to reconnect customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expensed incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain component betterment and replacement of cable drop and outlet are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network and or receiving advanced or internet service customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with customer installation installation of equipment in connection with the installation of video internet or voice service and equipment replacement and betterment and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer digital set top box well testing signal level at the pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity iii the cost of support personnel such care personnel and dispatcher who assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity while we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our system activity could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy we capitalized direct labor and overhead of million million and million respectively for the year ended december and valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment we evaluate the recoverability of our property plant and equipment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such event or change in circumstance could include such factor the impairment of our indefinite life franchise change in technological advance fluctuation in the fair value of such asset adverse change in relationship with local franchise authority adverse change in market condition or deterioration of current or expected future operating result long lived is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flow associated with the asset no impairment of long lived asset to be held and used were recorded in the year ended december and we utilize the cost approach the primary method used to establish fair value for our property plant and equipment in connection with business combination the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing new asset with similar utility then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence of the appraisal date the cost approach relies on management assumption regarding current material and labor cost required to rebuild and repurchase significant component of our property plant and equipment along with assumption regarding the age and estimated useful life of our property plant and equipment useful life of property plant and equipment we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful life assigned to our property plant and equipment based on annual analysis of such useful life and revise such life to the extent warranted by changing fact and circumstance any change in estimated useful life result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed our analysis of useful life in did not indicate change in useful life the effect of one year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately billion the effect of one year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million depreciation expense related to property plant and equipment totaled billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively representing approximately and of cost and expense respectively depreciation is recorded using the straight line composite method over management estimate of the useful life of the related asset listed below cable distribution system yearscustomer premise equipment and installation yearsvehicles and equipment yearsbuildings and improvement yearsfurniture fixture and equipment yearsintangible asset valuation and impairment of franchise the net carrying value of franchise of december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent respectively for more information and complete discussion of how we value and test franchise asset for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform an impairment assessment of franchise asset annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance we performed qualitative assessment in our assessment included consideration of the fair value appraisal of legacy charter and the newly acquired operation performed of the date of acquisition for tax and acquisition accounting purpose respectively along with multitude of factor that affect the fair value of our franchise asset example of such factor include environmental and competitive change within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margin equity and debt market trend including change in our market capitalization and change in our regulatory and political landscape among other factor based on our assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our franchise asset equal or exceeds their carrying value and that quantitative impairment test is not required the appraisal indicated that the fair value of our franchise asset exceeded carrying value by approximately in the aggregate with the excess entirely attributable to the franchise asset of legacy charter to which acquisition accounting wa not applied at our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing the amount by which fair value exceeds carrying value varies based on the extent to which the unit of accounting wa comprised of newly acquired operation for unit of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly acquired operation we believe the carrying value approximates the fair value given that there ha been no significant adverse change in factor impacting our fair value estimate since the transaction date for unit of accounting comprised of at least legacy charter operation the fair value exceeded carrying value by range of to and impairment of goodwill the net carrying value of goodwill of december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent respectively for more information and complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually of november with our franchise impairment testing we elected to perform qualitative assessment of goodwill in which included the fair value appraisal and other factor described above based on the appraisal we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately of the closing of the transaction given the limited amount of time between the closing of the transaction and the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse change in factor impacting our fair value estimate we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired valuation impairment and amortization of customer relationship the net carrying value of customer relationship of december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset and million representing of total asset excluding restricted cash and cash equivalent respectively amortization expense related to customer relationship for the year ended december and wa approximately billion million and million respectively no impairment of customer relationship wa recorded in the year ended december and for more information and complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data income tax of december charter had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary and from loss carryforwards received result of the twc transaction federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through in addition of december charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter future taxable income of december all of charter federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section and other restriction pursuant to these restriction charter estimate that approximately billion in billion in million in and an additional million annually over each of the next five year of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charter use an additional million is currently subject to valuation allowance charter state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restriction in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized in evaluating the need for valuation allowance management take into account various factor including the expected level of future taxable income available tax planning strategy and reversal of existing taxable temporary difference due to legacy charter history of loss legacy charter wa historically unable to assume future taxable income in it analysis and accordingly valuation allowance were established against the deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liability from definite lived asset for book accounting purpose however result of the twc transaction deferred tax liability resulting from the book fair value adjustment increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary difference for which deferred tax liability are recognized is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax asset result charter ha reversed approximately billion of it valuation allowance and recognized corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december approximately million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax asset remains on the december consolidated balance sheet in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purpose charter establishes reserve for uncertain tax position unless such position are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merit in evaluating whether tax position ha met the more likely than not recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information tax position that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statement the tax position is measured the largest amount of benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether position taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained charter adjusts it uncertain tax reserve estimate periodically because of ongoing examination by and settlement with the various taxing authority well change in tax law regulation and interpretation tax year for charter charter holding or charter holdco for income tax purpose are currently under examination by the irs charter and charter holding tax year remains open for assessment legacy charter tax year ending through the short period return dated may remain subject to examination and assessment year prior to remain open solely for purpose of examination of legacy charter loss and credit carryforwards the irs is currently examining legacy twc income tax return for and legacy twc tax year ending through remain subject to examination and assessment prior to legacy twc separation from time warner inc time warner in march the separation legacy twc wa included in the consolidated federal and certain state income tax return of time warner the irs is currently examining time warner through income tax return time warner income tax return for to which are period prior to the separation were settled with the exception of an immaterial item that ha been referred to the irs appeal division we have unrecognized tax benefit exclusive of interest and penalty totaling approximately million and million of december and respectively litigationlegal contingency have high degree of uncertainty when loss from contingency becomes estimable and probable reserve is established the reserve reflects management best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised fact and circumstance change reserve is released when matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitation lapse we have established reserve for certain matter although these matter are not expected individually to have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity such matter could have in the aggregate material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity programming agreement we exercise significant judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contract our policy is to record video programming cost based on our contractual agreement with our programming vendor which are generally multi year agreement that provide for to make payment to the programming vendor at agreed upon market rate based on the number of customer to which we provide the programming service if programming contract expires prior to the party entry into new agreement and we continue to distribute the service we estimate the programming cost during the period there is no contract in place in doing so we consider the previous contractual rate inflation and the status of the negotiation in determining our estimate when the programming contract term are finalized an adjustment to programming expense is recorded if necessary to reflect the term of the new contract we also make estimate in the recognition of programming expense related to other item such the accounting for free period timing of rate increase and credit from service interruption well the allocation of consideration exchanged between the party in multiple element transaction significant judgment is also involved when we enter into agreement that result in receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor usually in the form of advertising sale channel positioning fee launch support or marketing support in these situation we must determine based upon fact and circumstance if such cash consideration should be recorded revenue reduction in programming expense or reduction in another expense category marketing pension plansupon completion of the twc transaction we assumed legacy twc pension plan we sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plan the twc pension plan and the twc union pension plan collectively the twc pension plan that provide pension benefit to majority of legacy twc employee we also provide nonqualified defined benefit pension plan for certain employee under the twc excess pension plan of december the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan asset for the twc pension plan wa billion and billion respectively and the net underfunded liability of the twc pension plan wa recorded million noncurrent asset million current liability and million long term liability pension benefit are based on formula that reflect the employee year of service and compensation during their employment period actuarial gain or loss are change in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan asset resulting from experience different from that assumed or from change in assumption we have elected to follow mark to market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gain or loss annually during the fourth quarter or earlier if remeasurement event occurs during an interim period we use december measurement date for our pension plan we recognized net periodic pension benefit of million in net

included in the company consolidated statement of operation were billion and billion for legacy twc and legacy bright house respectively for the year ended december charter applied acquisition accounting to the transaction the total purchase price wa allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible asset acquired and the liability assumed based on their estimated fair value the fair value were primarily based on third party valuation using assumption developed by management and other information compiled by management including but not limited to future expected cash flow the excess of the purchase price over those fair value wa recorded goodwill goodwill recognized in the transaction is representative of resource that do not meet the definition of an identifiable intangible asset and include buy side synergy economy of scale of the combined operation increased market share assembled workforce and improved credit rating the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed were preliminarily determined using the income cost and market approach the fair value were primarily based on significant input that are not observable in the market and thus represent level measurement other than long term debt assumed in the twc transaction which represents level measurement see note property plant and equipment wa valued utilizing the cost approach the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing new asset with similar utility then adjusts the value in consideration of all form of depreciation of the appraisal date described below physical depreciation the loss in value or usefulness attributable solely to use of the asset and physical cause such wear and tear and exposure to the element functional obsolescence the loss in value due to factor inherent in the asset and due to change in technology design or process resulting in inadequacy overcapacity lack of functional utility or excess operating cost economic obsolescence the loss in value due to unfavorable external condition such economics of the industry or geographic area or change in ordinance the cost approach relies on assumption regarding current material and labor cost required to rebuild and repurchase significant component of property plant and equipment along with assumption regarding the age and estimated useful life of property plant and equipment franchise right and customer relationship were valued using an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flow attributable to each of the intangible asset identified see note for more information on the income approach model the weighted average life of customer relationship acquired in the twc transaction and bright house transaction wa year and year respectively the fair value of equity investment wa based on either applying implied multiple to estimated cash flow or utilizing discounted cash flow model the implied multiple were estimated based on precedent transaction and comparable company the discounted cash flow model required estimating the present value of future cash flow of the investee legacy twc long term debt assumed wa adjusted to fair value based on quoted market price at the acquisition date the quoted market value of all but two of legacy twc bond were higher than the principal amount of the related debt instrument which resulted in the recognition of net debt premium of approximately billion the quoted market value of debt instrument is higher than the principal amount of the debt when the market interest rate are lower than the stated interest rate of the debt this debt premium is amortized reduction to interest expense over the remaining life of the applicable debt generally no fair value adjustment were reflected in current asset and current liability carrying value is estimated to approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the item except for risk management obligation risk management obligation assumed including various claim for worker compensation employment practice and auto and general liability were measured at fair value of the acquisition date based on an actuarially determined study fair value adjustment were reflected in other noncurrent asset and other long term liability relating to contract based asset and

paid under the lease agreement using market participant discount rate deferred liability were not recorded in acquisition accounting to the extent there wa no associated payment obligation or substantive performance obligation the net pension liability assumed in the twc transaction were measured at fair value based on an actuarially determined projected benefit obligation le the fair value of pension investment of the acquisition date see note for fair value assumption considered in acquisition accounting for the net pension liability deferred tax asset and liability were recorded for the deferred tax impact of acquisition accounting adjustment primarily related to property plant and equipment franchise customer relationship and assumed legacy twc long term debt the incremental deferred tax liability were calculated primarily based on the tax effect of the step up in book basis of net asset of legacy twc excluding the amount attributable to nondeductible goodwill the charter class common stock issued to legacy twc stockholder and charter holding common unit issued to were valued based on the opening share price of charter class common stock on the acquisition date the convertible preferred unit of charter holding issued to were valued at approximately billion based on binomial lattice model for convertible bond that model the future change in the common equity value of charter the valuation relies on management assumption including risk free interest rate volatility and discount yield the pre combination vesting period fair value of the converted twc award wa based on the portion of the requisite service period completed at the acquisition date by legacy twc employee award holder applied to the total fair value of the converted twc award the allocation of the purchase price to certain asset and liability is preliminary and is subject to change based on additional information that may be obtained during the measurement period primarily related to working capital measurement the company will continue to obtain information to assist in finalizing the fair value of net asset acquired and liability assumed which is not expected to differ materially from the preliminary estimate herein the company will apply any measurement period adjustment including any related impact to net income loss in the reporting period in which the adjustment

the future economic benefit of the right to solicit and service potential customer customer marketing right and the right to deploy and market new service to potential customer service marketing right management estimate the fair value of franchise right at the date of acquisition and determines if the franchise ha finite life or an indefinite life the company ha concluded that all of it franchise including those acquired part of the transaction qualify for indefinite life treatment given that there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow we reassess this determination periodically or whenever event or substantive change in circumstance occur the estimated fair value of franchise is determined utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flow attributable to each of the intangible asset identified assuming discount rate the fair value of franchise is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flow using assumption consistent with internal forecast the franchise after tax cash flow is calculated the after tax cash flow generated by the potential customer obtained the sum of the present value of the franchise after tax cash flow in year through and the continuing value of the after tax cash flow beyond year yield the fair value of the franchise this approach make use of unobservable factor such projected revenue expense capital expenditure customer trend and discount rate applied to the estimated cash flow the determination of the franchise discount rate is derived from the company weighted average cost of capital which us market participant cost of equity and after tax cost of debt and reflects the risk inherent in the cash flow the company estimate discounted future cash flow using reasonable and appropriate assumption including among others penetration rate for video internet

data or where indicated programming expense growth rate the amount and timing of capital expenditure actual customer trend and the discount rate utilized all franchise are tested for impairment annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance franchise asset are aggregated into essentially inseparable unit of accounting to conduct valuation the unit of accounting generally represent geographical clustering of our cable system into group the company ass qualitative factor to determine whether the existence of event or circumstance lead to determination that it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired if after this optional qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired then no further quantitative testing is necessary in completing the qualitative impairment testing the company evaluates multitude of factor that affect the fair value of our franchise asset example of such factor include environmental and competitive change within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margin equity and debt market trend including change in our market capitalization and change in our regulatory and political landscape among other factor after consideration of the qualitative factor in the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise asset in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such asset and therefore did not perform quantitative analysis periodically the company will elect to perform quantitative analysis for impairment testing if the company elect or is required to perform quantitative analysis to test it franchise asset for impairment the methodology described above is utilized the fair value of goodwill is determined using both an income approach and market approach the company income approach model used for it goodwill valuation is consistent with that used for it franchise valuation noted above except that cash flow from the entire business enterprise are used for the goodwill valuation the company market approach model estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on market price in actual precedent transaction of similar business and market valuation of guideline public company goodwill is tested for impairment of november of each year or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance accounting guidance also permit an optional qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value if after this qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary if the company elect or is required to perform the two step test under the accounting guidance the first step involves comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment is not necessary if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed and comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to it carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment if any with the company franchise impairment testing in the company elected to perform qualitative goodwill impairment assessment and concluded that goodwill is not impaired customer relationship are recorded at fair value of the date acquired le accumulated amortization customer relationship for valuation purpose represent the value of the business relationship with existing customer and are calculated by projecting the discrete future after tax cash flow from these customer including the right to deploy and market additional service to these customer the present value of these after tax cash flow yield the fair value of the customer relationship the use of different valuation assumption or definition of franchise or customer relationship such our inclusion of the value of selling additional service to our current customer within customer relationship versus franchise could significantly impact our valuation and any resulting impairment customer relationship are amortized on an accelerated sum of year digit method over useful life of year based on the period over which current customer are expected to generate cash flow the company periodically evaluates the remaining useful life of it customer relationship to determine whether event or circumstance warrant revision to the remaining period of amortization customer relationship are evaluated for impairment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable customer relationship are deemed impaired when the carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flow associated with the customer relationship no impairment of customer relationship
