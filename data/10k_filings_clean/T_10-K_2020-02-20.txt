in addition to the other information set forth in this document including the matter contained under the caption cautionary language concerning forward looking statement you should carefully read the matter described below we believe that each of these matter could materially affect our business we recognize that most of these factor are beyond our ability to control and therefore we can not predict an outcome macro economic factor adverse change in medical cost the security market and interest rate could materially increase our benefit plan cost our cost to provide current benefit and funding for future benefit are subject to increase primarily due to continuing increase in medical and prescription drug cost and can be affected by lower return on fund held by our pension and other benefit plan which are reflected in our financial statement for that year favorable market return in have led to higher than assumed investment return on our plan asset with lower end of period yield curve contributing to higher benefit obligation resulting in an insignificant change to our overall funding obligation should favorable market return continue we may need to adjust our assumed rate of return on plan asset in calculating the cost included on our financial statement of providing benefit under our plan we have made certain assumption regarding future investment return medical cost and interest rate while we have made some change to the benefit plan to limit our risk from increasing medical cost if actual investment return medical cost and interest rate are worse than those previously assumed our expense will increase the financial accounting standard board requires company to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan an asset or liability in our statement of financial position and to recognize change in that funded status in the year in which the change occur we have elected to reflect the annual adjustment to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income therefore an increase in our cost or adverse market condition will have negative effect on our operating result adverse change in global financial market could limit our ability and our larger customer ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operation during volatility in the credit currency equity and fixed income market persisted due to continued uncertainty surrounding global growth rate uncertainty regarding ongoing tariff on chinese good and vice versa the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union and other political development in europe and asia could significantly affect global financial market in volatility in other area such in emerging market may affect company access to the credit market leading to higher borrowing cost or in some case the inability to fund ongoing operation in addition we contract with large financial institution to support our own treasury operation including contract to hedge our exposure on interest rate and foreign exchange and the funding of credit line and other short term debt obligation including commercial paper these financial institution face stricter capital related and other regulation in the united state and europe well ongoing legal and financial issue concerning their loan portfolio which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit the interest rate used to calculate the rate of variable rate indebtedness the libor benchmark will not be reported after although our security may provide for alternative method of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty to the extent and manner of future change may adversely affect the current trading market for libor based security and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general company cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluation given by various credit rating agency and these agency have been applying tighter credit standard when evaluating debt level and future growth prospect while we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income market when needed adverse change in the financial market could render either unable to access these market or able to access these market only at higher interest cost and with restrictive financial or other condition severely affecting our business operation our international operation have increased our exposure to political instability to change in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risk could offset our expected growth opportunity inc dollar in million except per share amount we have international operation particularly latin america including mexico and worldwide through warnermedia content distribution well service to our large based business we need to comply with wide variety of complex local law regulation and treaty we are exposed to restriction on cash repatriation foreign exchange control fluctuation in currency value change in relationship between and foreign government trade restriction including potential tariff difference in intellectual property protection law and other regulation that may affect materially our earnings our mexico operation in particular rely on continuation of regulatory regime that foster competition while our foreign operation represent significant opportunity to sell our service number of foreign country where we operate have experienced unstable growth pattern high inflation currency devaluation foreign exchange control instability in the banking sector and high unemployment in addition several latin america country have experienced significant political turmoil during should these condition persist our ability to offer service in one or more country could be adversely affected and customer in these country may be unable to purchase the service we offer or pay for service already provided in addition operating in foreign country also typically involves participating with local business either to comply with local law or for example to enhance product marketing deploy network or execute on other capital project involvement with foreign firm expose to the risk of being unable to control the action of those firm and therefore expose to risk associated with our obligation to comply with the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa violation of the fcpa could have material adverse effect on our operating result industry wide factor change to federal state and foreign government regulation and decision in regulatory proceeding could further increase our operating cost and or alter customer perception of our operation which could materially adversely affect our subsidiary providing wired service are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitor are not in addition our subsidiary and affiliate operating outside the united state are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authority in the market where service is provided our wireless and various video subsidiary are regulated to varying degree by the fcc and in some instance by state and local agency adverse regulation and ruling by the fcc relating to broadband wireless deployment and satellite video issue could impede our ability to manage our network and recover cost and lessen incentive to invest in our network the continuing growth of ip based service especially when accessed by wireless device ha created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authority which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcome unfavorable to in addition increased public focus on variety of issue related to our operation such privacy issue government request or order for customer data and concern about global climate change have led to proposal or new legislation at state federal and foreign government level to change or increase regulation on our operation enactment of new privacy law and regulation could among other thing adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisement an expected growth area for the company or result in additional cost of compliance or litigation should customer decide that our competitor offer more customer friendly environment our competitive position result of operation or financial condition could be materially adversely affected continuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless video and broadband service will require to deploy significant amount of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive service to customer wireless video and broadband service are undergoing rapid and significant technological change and dramatic increase in usage in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of video and data across mobile and fixed device we must continually invest in our network in order to improve our wireless video and broadband service to meet this increasing demand and remain competitive improvement in these service depend on many factor including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these service in order to stem broadband subscriber loss to cable competitor in our non fiber wireline area we have been expanding our all fiber wireline network we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of video data and voice between cell and fixed landline site to this end we have participated in spectrum auction and continue to deploy software and other technology advancement in order to efficiently invest in our network network service enhancement and product launch may not occur scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factor including delay in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standard supplier delay software issue inc dollar in million except per share amount increase in network and handset component cost regulatory permitting delay for tower site or enhancement or labor related delay deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing service if we can not acquire needed spectrum or deploy the service customer desire on timely basis with acceptable quality and at adequate cost our ability to attract and retain customer and therefore maintain and improve our operating margin could be materially adversely affected increasing competition for wireless customer could materially adversely affect our operating result we have multiple wireless competitor in each of our service area and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network quality coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from provider offering service using advanced wireless technology and ip based network we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rate leading to increased competition for customer we also expect that our customer growing demand for high speed video and data service will place constraint on our network capacity these competition and capacity constraint will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to respond will depend among other thing on continued improvement in network quality and customer service well effective marketing of attractive product and service these effort will involve significant expense and require strategic management decision on and timely implementation of equipment choice network deployment and service offering ongoing change in the television industry and consumer viewing pattern could materially adversely affect our operating result our video subsidiary derive substantial revenue and profit from cable network and premium pay television service and the production and licensing of television programming to broadcast and cable network and premium pay television service the television industry is continuing to evolve rapidly with development in technology leading to new method for the distribution of video content and change in when where and audience consume video content these change have led to new internet based ott competitor which are increasing in number and some of which have significant and growing subscriber user base and reduced viewer of traditional advertising supported television resulting from increased video consumption through svod service time shifted viewing of television programming and the use of dvrs to skip advertisement the number of subscriber to traditional linear programming in the ha been declining in recent year and the television industry ha generally experienced decline in rating for programming which have negatively affected subscription and advertising revenue and these trend are expected to continue the popularity of content whether on television on the internet or through movie is difficult to predict and can change rapidly and low public acceptance of our television ott and movie content including warnermedia content could adversely affect our result of operation we are taking step to mitigate the risk from these change such our launch of our hbo max direct to consumer streaming platform and new enhanced advertising opportunity but there can be no assurance that these and other effort will be successful in responding to these change intellectual property right may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunity such new distribution platform which may materially adversely affect our operation increased piracy of video content product and other intellectual property particularly in our foreign warnermedia and latin american operation will decrease revenue mobile and broadband technological development have made it easier to reproduce and distribute high quality unauthorized copy of content piracy is particularly prevalent in country that lack effective copyright and other legal protection or enforcement measure and thief can attract user throughout the world effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate we may need to spend significant amount of money to protect our right we are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreement to expand our ability to use new method to distribute content to customer any impairment of our intellectual property right including due to change in or foreign intellectual property law or the absence of effective legal protection or enforcement measure or our inability to negotiate broader distribution right could materially adversely impact our operation company specific financial factor adoption of new software based technology may involve quality and supply chain issue and could increase capital cost inc dollar in million except per share amount the communication and digital entertainment industry ha experienced rapid change in the past several year an increasing number of our customer are using mobile device the primary mean of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video provider are developing content and technology to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand in addition business and government body are broadly shifting to wireless based service for home and infrastructure to improve service to their respective customer and constituency in order to meet this demand and remain competitive we now offer mobile tv service and continue to upgrade our sophisticated wired and wireless network including satellite well research other technology we are spending significant capital to shift our wired network to software based technology to manage this demand and are launching wireless technology to address these consumer demand we are entering into significant number of software licensing agreement and working with software developer to provide network function in lieu of installing switch or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid development in video and wireless demand while software based functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switch the rapid pace of development mean that we may increasingly need to rely on single source and software solution that have not previously been deployed in production environment should this software not function intended or our license agreement provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claim we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technology at much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected increasing cost to provide video and other service could adversely affect operating margin our operating cost including customer acquisition and retention cost could continue to put pressure on margin and customer retention level in addition most of our video programming that we distribute via our linear service is provided by other company and historically the rate they charge for programming have often increased more than the rate of inflation in addition customer viewing habit shift to mobile and on demand from linear programming negotiating licensing right is increasingly complicated we are attempting to use our increased scale and access to wireless customer to change this trend but such negotiation are difficult and also may result in programming disruption our new hbo max streaming platform is another component of our strategy to reach nontraditional video customer and we are investing heavily to launch competitive and attractive offering if we are unable to restrain these cost or provide programming desired by our customer it could impact margin and our ability to attract and retain customer our warnermedia operation which create and license content to other provider also may experience increasing difficulty to secure favorable term including those related to pricing positioning and packaging during contract negotiation which may lead to blackout of warnermedia programming and warnermedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of it network and premium pay television service in smaller bundle or mobile offering by third party number of our competitor offering comparable legacy service that rely on alternative technology and business model are typically subject to le or no regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower cost these competitor generally can focus on discrete customer segment since they do not have regulatory obligation to provide universal service also these competitor have cost advantage compared to due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lower cost network and nonunionized workforce lower employee benefit and fewer retiree we have begun initiative at both the state and federal level to obtain regulatory approval where needed to transition service from our older copper based network to an advanced ip based network if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our network transition or obtain approval with onerous condition we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantage if our effort to attract and retain subscriber to our new hbo max platform are not successful our business will be adversely affected with any new product launch hbo max future success is subject to inherent uncertainty our ability to attract subscriber to the hbo max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscriber with compelling content choice well quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choice furthermore the relative service level content offering promotion and pricing and related feature of competitor to hbo max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscriber competitor include other entertainment video provider such multichannel video programming distributor and internet based movie and tv content provider if consumer do not perceive our offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing feature adjust pricing or offering terminate or modify promotional or trial period offering experience technical issue or change the mix of content in manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscriber in addition many subscriber to these type of offering originate from word of mouth advertising from then existing subscriber if our effort to satisfy subscriber are not successful including because we terminate or modify promotional or trial period offering inc dollar in million except per share amount because of technical issue with the platform we may not be able to attract subscriber and result our ability to maintain and or grow our business will be adversely affected if subscriber cancel or decide to not continue subscription for many reason including perception that they do not use it sufficiently the need to cut household expense unsatisfactory availability of content promotion or trial period offer expire or are modified competitive service or promotion provide better value or experience and customer service or technical issue are not satisfactorily resolved our business will be adversely affected we must continually add new subscriber both to replace canceled subscriber and to grow our business if we do not grow expected given in particular that significant portion of our content cost are committed and contracted over several year based on minimum subscriber delivery level we may not be able to adjust our expenditure or increase our per subscriber revenue commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margin liquidity and result of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with competitor in retaining and attracting new subscriber our business will be adversely affected further if excessive number of subscriber do cancel we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditure or offer significantly more generous promotion to replace these subscriber with new subscriber unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation result could require to pay significant amount or lead to onerous operating procedure we are subject to number of lawsuit both in the united state and in foreign country including at any particular time claim relating to antitrust patent infringement wage and hour personal injury customer privacy violation regulatory proceeding and selling and collection practice we also spend substantial resource complying with various government standard which may entail related investigation and litigation in the wireless area we also face current and potential litigation relating to alleged adverse health effect on customer or employee who use such technology including for example wireless device we may incur significant expense defending such suit or government charge and may be required to pay amount or otherwise change our operation in way that could materially adversely affect our operation or financial result cyberattacks equipment failure natural disaster and terrorist act may materially adversely affect our operation cyberattacks major equipment failure or natural disaster such flooding hurricane and forest fire whether caused by discrete severe weather event and or precipitated by long term climate change and earthquake software problem terrorist act or other breach of network or it security that affect our network including software and switch microwave link third party owned local and long distance network on which we rely our cell site or other equipment our satellite our customer account support and information system or employee and business record could have material adverse effect on our operation our wired network in particular is becoming increasingly reliant on software it evolves to handle increasing demand for video transmission while we have been subject to security incident or cyberattacks these not result in material adverse effect on our operation however such attack continue to increase in scope and frequency we may be unable to prevent significant attack in the future our ability to maintain and upgrade our video programming also depends on our ability to successfully deploy and operate video satellite our inability to deploy or operate our network or customer support system or protect sensitive personal information of customer or valuable technical and marketing information could result in significant expense potential legal liability loss of current or future customer and reputation damage any of which could have material adverse effect on our operation and financial condition increase in our debt level to fund acquisition additional spectrum purchase or other strategic decision could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rate and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trend we have incurred debt to fund significant acquisition well spectrum purchase needed to compete in our industry while we believe such decision were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunity and respond to industry development we did experience credit rating downgrade from historical level bank and potential purchaser of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decision and similar action we may take in the future well expected trend in the industry will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand higher rate of interest impose restrictive covenant or otherwise limit the amount of potential borrowing additionally our capital allocation plan is focused on among other thing further reducing our debt going forward any failure to successfully execute this plan could adversely affect our cost of fund liquidity competitive position and access to capital market inc dollar in million

legacy and video service and lower wireless equipment upgrade that were offset by growth in advanced data and wireless service operation and support expense increased in primarily due to our acquisition of time warner and the abandonment of certain copper asset that will not be necessary to support future network activity see note the increase wa partially offset by lower cost in our communication segment specifically fewer subscriber contributing to lower content cost lower upgrade driving decline in wireless equipment cost and our continued focus on cost management depreciation and amortization expense decreased in amortization expense decreased or in primarily due to the amortization of intangible associated with warnermedia we expect continued decline in amortization expense reflecting the accelerated method of amortization applied to certain of the warnermedia intangible depreciation expense increased or in primarily due to the time warner acquisition operating

made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancement through deployment in our communication segment we expect that our network quality and first responder network authority firstnet deployment will contribute to wireless subscriber and service revenue growth and that handset introduction during will drive wireless equipment revenue growth we anticipate that application

are subject to federal and state regulatory authority at subsidiary operating outside the united state are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authority in the market where service is provided in the telecommunication act of telecom act congress established national policy framework intended to bring the benefit of competition and investment in advanced telecommunication facility and service to all american by opening all telecommunication market to competition and reducing or eliminating regulatory burden that harm consumer welfare nonetheless over the ensuing two decade the federal communication commission fcc and some state regulatory commission have maintained or expanded certain regulatory requirement that were imposed decade ago on our traditional wireline subsidiary when they operated legal monopoly more recently the fcc ha pursued more deregulatory agenda eliminating variety of antiquated and unnecessary regulation and streamlining it process in number of area in addition we are pursuing at both the state and federal level additional legislative and inc dollar in million except per share amount measure to reduce regulatory burden that are no longer appropriate in competitive telecommunication market and that inhibit our ability to compete more effectively and offer service wanted and needed by our customer including initiative to transition service from traditional network to all ip based network at the time we also seek to ensure that legacy regulation are not further extended to broadband or wireless service which are subject to vigorous competition we have organized the following discussion by reportable segment communication segmentinternet the fcc currently classifies fixed and mobile consumer broadband service information service subject to light touch regulation although the circuit upheld the fcc current classification challenge to that decision remain pending more detailed discussion can be found under regulatory development number of state have adopted legislation or issued executive order that would reimpose net neutrality rule repealed by the fcc and in some case established additional requirement suit have been filed concerning law in certain state but have been stayed pursuant to agreement by those state not to enforce their law pending final resolution of all appeal we will continue to support congressional action to codify set of standard consumer rule for the internet more detailed discussion can be found under regulatory development in october the fcc adopted new rule governing the use of customer information by provider of broadband internet access service those rule were more restrictive in certain respect than those governing other participant in the internet economy including so called edge provider such google and facebook in april the president signed resolution passed by congress repealing the new rule under the congressional review act privacy related legislation ha been considered or adopted in number of state legislative and regulatory action could result in increased cost of compliance claim against broadband internet access service provider and others and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data effective of january california state law give consumer the right to know what personal information is being collected about them and whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed and to access and request deletion of this information subject to certain exception it also give california consumer the right to opt out of the sale of personal information wireless the industry wide deployment of technology which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access will involve significant deployment of small cell equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting process that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timeline and term federal regulation also can delay and impede the deployment of infrastructure used to provide telecommunication and broadband service including small cell equipment in march august and september the fcc adopted order to streamline federal and local wireless infrastructure review process in order to facilitate deployment of next generation wireless facility specifically the fcc march order streamlined historical tribal and environmental review requirement for wireless infrastructure including by excluding most small cell facility from such review the order wa appealed and in august the circuit court of appeal vacated the fcc finding that most small cell facility are excluded from review but otherwise upheld the fcc order the fcc august and september order simplified the regulation for attaching telecommunication equipment to utility pole and clarified when local government right of way access and use restriction can be preempted because they unlawfully prohibit the provision of telecommunication service those order were appealed to the circuit court of appeal where they remain pending in addition to the fcc action to date state and puerto rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment in december we introduced the nation first commercial mobile service we expect to have mobile service available nationwide to more than million people by the second quarter of we anticipate the introduction of handset and device will contribute to renewed interest in equipment upgrade the wireless industry ha matured we believe future wireless growth will depend

while these issue may apply only to certain subsidiary the word we at and our are used to simplify the discussion the following discussion are intended condensed summary of the issue rather than comprehensive legal analysis and description of all of these specific issue international regulation our subsidiary operating outside the united state are subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory authority in the territory in which the subsidiary operate our licensing compliance and advocacy initiative in foreign country primarily enable the provision of enterprise large business wireless and satellite television service at is engaged in multiple effort with foreign regulator to open market to competition foster condition favorable to investment and increase our scope of service and product the general data protection regulation went into effect in europe in may of at process and handle personal data of it customer and subscriber employee of it enterprise customer and it employee this regulation created range of new compliance obligation and significantly increased financial penalty for noncompliance federal regulation we have organized our following discussion by service impacted internet in february the fcc released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access service telecommunication service subject to title ii of the communication act the order which represented departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent significantly expanded the fcc authority to regulate broadband internet access service well internet interconnection arrangement in december the fcc reversed it decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband service information service and repealing most of the rule that were adopted in in lieu of broad conduct prohibition the order requires internet service provider to disclose information about their network practice and term of service including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization several party appealed the fcc december decision and the circuit heard oral argument on the appeal on february on october the court issued unanimous opinion upholding the fcc reclassification of broadband an information service and it reliance on transparency requirement and competitive marketplace dynamic to safeguard net neutrality while the court vacated the fcc express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality it nevertheless stressed that it ruling doe not prevent the fcc or isps from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state law that are inconsistent with the fcc regulatory objective and framework the court also concluded that the fcc failed to satisfy it obligation under the administrative procedure act apa to consider the impact of it order in three discrete area public safety the lifeline program and pole attachment regulation and thus remanded it to the fcc for further proceeding on those issue but without disturbing the operative effect of that order several petition for rehearing of the circuit october decision have been filed those petition remain pending number of state have adopted legislation to reimpose the very rule the fcc repealed in some case state legislation imposes requirement that go beyond the fcc february order additionally some state governor have issued executive order that effectively reimpose the repealed requirement suit have been filed concerning law in california and vermont both lawsuit have been stayed pursuant to agreement by those state not to enforce their law pending final resolution of all appeal of the fcc december order we expect that going forward additional state may seek to impose net neutrality requirement we will continue to support congressional action to codify set of standard consumer rule for the internet wireless and broadband since november the fcc ha adopted four significant ruling designed to accelerate broadband infrastructure deployment in november the fcc updated and streamlined certain rule governing pole attachment copper retirement and service discontinuance in march the fcc eliminated lengthy environmental historical and tribal review for most small cell deployment and streamlined process that must be followed when those review are required the circuit court of appeal vacated the fcc finding in this order that small cell facility do not require environmental historical and tribal review but left intact all other process adopted to streamline review when required in august the fcc adopted more comprehensive pole attachment reform including by simplifying the attaching process one touch make ready and clarified that the communication act precludes local government from imposing moratorium on the deployment of communication facility and in september the fcc restricted the inc dollar in million except per share amount of state and local government to impede small cell deployment in right of way and on government owned structure through exorbitant fee unreasonable aesthetic requirement and other action these decision will remove regulatory barrier and reduce the cost of the infrastructure needed for deployment which will enhance our ability to place small cell facility on utility pole and to replace legacy facility and service with advanced broadband infrastructure and service appeal of the august and september order remain pending in the circuit court of appeal in the fcc took several action to make spectrum available for service in late the fcc adopted auction rule for the ghz band that will allow the fcc to auction remaining unlicensed ghz spectrum and realign the band to allow large contiguous block of spectrum that will support this auction which also includes spectrum in the ghz and ghz band is currently underway the fcc ha granted at special temporary authority to launch it service in mhz of contiguous spectrum in the ghz band in total of market in addition the fcc completed auction in of and ghz spectrum two other band that will support at wa awarded ghz license covering nationwide footprint accounting policy and standardscritical accounting policy and estimate because of the size of the financial statement line item they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management some of our accounting policy and estimate have more significant impact on our consolidated financial statement than others the following policy are presented in the order in which the topic appear in our consolidated statement of income pension and postretirement benefit our actuarial estimate of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted average assumption are discussed in note our assumed weighted average discount rate for pension and postretirement benefit of and respectively at december reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow for the obligation these bond were all rated at least or aa by one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization denominated in dollar and neither callable convertible index linked for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december we decreased our pension discount rate by resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of and decreased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of our expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset is for and our expected long term rate of return on postretirement plan asset is for and for our expected return on plan asset is calculated using the actual fair value of plan asset if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that decrease in the expected long term rate of return would cause combined pension and postretirement cost to increase which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual return in the current year part of our fourth quarter remeasurement of our retiree benefit plan we recognize gain and loss on pension and postretirement plan asset and obligation immediately in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income these gain and loss are generally measured annually of december and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumption the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future year see note for additional discussion regarding our assumption depreciation our depreciation of asset including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiary and estimate of useful life is described in note and if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that one year increase in the useful life of our plant in service would have resulted in decrease of approximately in our depreciation expense and that one year decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately in our depreciation expense see note and for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property plant and equipment including our finance lease right of use asset asset valuation and impairment goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are not amortized but tested at least annually for impairment for impairment testing we estimate fair value using model that predominantly rely on inc dollar in million except per share amount expected cash flow to be derived from the use of the asset we recorded an impairment in for our sky brasil trade name see note we test goodwill on reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to it book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured we estimate fair value using an income approach also known discounted cash flow and market multiple approach the income approach utilizes our year cash flow projection with perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital the market multiple approach us the multiple of publicly traded company whose service are comparable to those offered by the reporting unit in the calculated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded their book value in all circumstance if either the projected rate of long term growth of cash flow or revenue declined by or if the discount rate increased by the fair value would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill in the event of drop in the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value still would have exceeded the book value of the reporting unit we ass fair value for wireless license using discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach and corroborative market approach based on auction price depending upon auction activity the greenfield approach assumes company initially owns only the wireless license and make investment required to build an operation comparable to current use input to the model include subscriber growth churn revenue per user capital investment and acquisition cost per subscriber ongoing operating cost and resulting ebitda margin we based our assumption on combination of average marketplace participant data and our historical result trend and business plan these license are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis consistent with their use on national scope for the united state for impairment testing we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected level with long term growth rate reflecting expected long term inflation trend we assume churn rate will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rate that are in line with industry leading churn we used discount rate of based on the optimal long term capital structure of market participant and it associated cost of debt and equity for the license to calculate the present value of the projected cash flow if either the projected rate of long term growth of cash flow or revenue declined by or if the discount rate increased by the fair value of these wireless license would still be higher than the book value of the license the fair value of these wireless license exceeded their book value by more than orbital slot are also valued using the greenfield approach the projected cash flow are based on various factor including satellite cost other capital investment per subscriber acquisition cost per subscriber and usage per subscriber well revenue growth subscriber growth and churn rate for impairment testing purpose we assumed sustainable long term growth assumption consistent with the business plan and industry counterpart in the united state we used discount rate of to calculate the present value of the projected cash flow in the fair value of orbital slot wa slightly lower than the prior year which exceeded the book value by approximately in the decrease in fair value wa driven by the transition of the video business to ott and streaming technology we review customer relationship license in mexico and other finite lived intangible asset for impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life for this analysis we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset to it book value we review operating lease right of use asset for impairment whenever event or circumstance indicated that the book value may not be recoverable over the remaining life we periodically ass our network asset for impairment see note income tax our estimate of income tax and the significant item giving rise to the deferred asset and liability are shown in note and reflect our assessment of actual future tax to be paid on item reflected in the financial statement giving consideration to both timing and probability of these estimate actual income tax could vary from these estimate due to future change in income tax law or the final review of our tax return by federal state or foreign tax authority we use our judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will sustain position that we have taken on tax return and if so the amount of benefit to initially recognize within our financial statement we regularly review our uncertain tax position and adjust our unrecognized tax benefit utbs in light of change in fact and circumstance such change in tax law interaction with taxing authority and development in case law these adjustment to our utbs may affect our income tax expense settlement of uncertain tax position may require use of our cash new accounting inc dollar in million except per share amount beginning with interim and annual reporting period we adopted the fasb new accounting guidance related to leasing the most significant impact of the new guidance wa to our balance sheet we recorded right of use asset and corresponding liability for our operating lease existing at january we adopted the new leasing standard using modified retrospective transition method of the beginning of the period of adoption which did not require to adjust the balance sheet for prior period

disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from change in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate these risk along with other business risk impact our cost of capital it is our policy to manage our debt structure and foreign exchange exposure in order to manage capital cost control financial risk and maintain financial flexibility over the long term in managing market risk we employ derivative according to documented policy and procedure including interest rate swap interest rate lock foreign currency exchange contract and combined interest rate foreign currency contract cross currency swap we do not use derivative for trading or speculative purpose we do not foresee significant change in the strategy we use to manage market risk in the near future one of the most significant assumption used in estimating our postretirement benefit obligation is the assumed weighted average discount rate which is the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow for the obligation in recent year the discount rate have been increasingly volatile and on average have been lower than in historical period lower discount rate used to measure our pension and postretirement plan result in higher obligation future increase in these rate could result in lower obligation improved funded status and actuarial gain interest rate risk the majority of our financial instrument are medium and long term fixed rate note and debenture change in interest rate can lead to significant fluctuation in the fair value of these instrument the principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate and fair value of our liability that are exposed to interest rate risk are described in note and in managing interest expense we control our mix of fixed and floating rate debt through term loan floating rate note and interest rate swap we have established interest rate risk limit that we closely monitor by measuring interest rate sensitivity in our debt and interest rate derivative portfolio most of our foreign denominated long term debt ha been swapped from fixed rate or floating rate foreign currency to fixed rate dollar at issuance through cross currency swap removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payment likewise periodically we enter into interest rate lock to partially hedge the risk of increase in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed rate debt we expect gain or loss in our cross currency swap and interest rate lock to offset the loss and gain in the financial instrument they hedge inc dollar in million except per share amount following are our interest rate derivative subject to material interest rate risk of december the interest rate illustrated below refer to the average rate we expect to pay based on current and implied forward rate and the average rate we expect to receive based on derivative contract the notional amount is the

film production cost denominated in foreign currency we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk through our foreign affiliate and equity investment in foreign company we have designated million aggregate principal amount of debt hedge of the variability of certain euro denominated net investment of our subsidiary the gain or loss on the debt that is designated and is effective an economic hedge of the net investment in foreign operation is recorded currency translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive income net on the consolidated balance sheet through cross

exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payment we expect gain or loss in our cross currency swap to offset the gain and loss in the financial instrument they hedge for the purpose of assessing specific risk we use sensitivity analysis to determine the effect that market risk exposure may have on the fair value of our financial instrument and result of operation we had

classified either finance or an operating lease without relying upon bright line test the key change upon adoption of the standard wa balance sheet recognition given that the recognition of lease expense on our income statement is similar to our historical accounting using the modified retrospective transition method of adoption we did not adjust the balance sheet for comparative period but recorded cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on january we elected the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other thing allowed to carry forward our historical lease classification we also elected the practical expedient related to land easement allowing to carry forward our accounting treatment for land easement on existing agreement that were not accounted for lease we excluded lease with original term of one year or le additionally we elected to not separate lease and non lease component for certain class of asset our accounting for finance lease did not change from our prior accounting for capital lease the adoption of asc resulted in the recognition of an operating lease liability of and an operating right of use asset of the same amount existing prepaid and deferred rent accrual were recorded an offset to the right of use asset resulting in net asset of the cumulative effect of the adoption to retained earnings wa an increase of reflecting the reclassification of deferred gain related to sale leaseback transaction the standard did not materially impact our income statement or statement of

asset and liability for financial reporting purpose and the computed tax basis of those asset and liability we record valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset included together with our deferred income tax asset part of our reportable net deferred income tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet for which the realization is uncertain we review these item regularly in light of

if the license agreement are long term when the cost of the programming is reasonably determined ii the programming material ha been accepted in accordance with the term of the agreement iii the programming is available for it first showing or telecast and iv the license period ha commenced there are variation in the amortization method of these right depending on whether the network is advertising supported tnt and tb or not advertising supported hbo and turner classic movie for the advertising supported network our general policy is to amortize each program cost on straight line basis or per play basis if greater over it license period in circumstance where the initial airing of the program ha more value than subsequent airing an accelerated method of amortization is used the accelerated amortization upon the first airing versus subsequent airing is determined based on study of historical and estimated future advertising sale for similar programming for right fee paid for sport programming arrangement such right fee are amortized using revenue forecast model in which the right fee are amortized using the ratio of current period advertising revenue to total estimated remaining advertising revenue over the term of the arrangement for premium pay television streaming and over the top ott service that are not advertising supported each licensed program cost are amortized on straight line basis over it license period or estimated period of use beginning with the month of initial exhibition when we have the right to exhibit feature theatrical programming in multiple window over number of year historical audience viewership is used the basis for determining the amount of programming amortization attributable to each window licensed programming inventory is carried at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value for network that generate both advertising and subscription revenue the net realizable value of unamortized programming cost is generally evaluated based on the network programming taken whole in assessing whether the programming inventory for particular advertising supported network is impaired the net realizable value for all of the network programming inventory is determined based on projection of the network profitability this assessment would occur upon the occurrence of certain triggering event similarly for premium pay television streaming and ott service that are not advertising supported an evaluation of the fair value of unamortized programming cost is performed based on service licensed programming taken whole specifically the fair value for all premium pay television streaming and ott service licensed programming is determined based on projection of estimated subscription revenue le certain cost of delivering and distributing the licensed programming change in management intended usage of specific program such decision to no longer exhibit that program and forgo the use of the right associated with the program license result in reassessment of that program fair value which could result in an impairment see note film and television production cost recognition participation and residual and

expense for given film or television series in particular period wa determined using the film forecast computation method under this method the amortization of capitalized cost and the accrual of participation and residual wa based on the proportion of the film or television program revenue recognized for such period to the film or television program estimated remaining ultimate revenue the total revenue to be received throughout film or television program life cycle the process of estimating film ultimate revenue requires to make series of judgment related to future revenue generating activity associated with particular film we estimate the ultimate revenue le additional cost to be incurred including exploitation and participation cost in order to determine whether the value of

margin reported on the exploitation of that film or television series in period is also adjusted prior to the theatrical release of film our estimate are based on factor such the historical performance of similar film the star power of the lead actor the rating and genre of the film pre release market research including test market screening international distribution plan and the

composite group depreciation methodology accordingly when portion of their depreciable property plant and equipment is retired in the ordinary course of business the gross book value is reclassified to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss is recognized on the disposition of these asset property plant and equipment is reviewed for recoverability whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of long lived asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset see note for discussion of asset abandonment the liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if reasonable estimate of fair value can be made in period subsequent to initial measurement we recognize period to period change in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revision to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate the increase in the

credit total recognized in other comprehensive income loss of asu at end of year inc dollar in million except per share amount assumptionsin determining the projected benefit obligation and the net pension and postretirement benefit cost we used the followingsignificant weighted average assumption pension benefit postretirement benefit average discount rate for determining benefit obligation at december discount rate in effect for determining service discount rate in effect for determining interest weighted average interest crediting rate for cash balance pension long term rate of return on plan composite rate of compensation increase for determining benefit composite rate of compensation increase for determining net cost benefit average discount rate for pension benefit in effect from january through march wa for service cost and for interest cost from april through june wa for service cost and for interest cost from july through september wa for service cost and for interest cost and from october through december wa for service cost and for interest cost average discount rate for postretirement benefit in effect from january through october wa for service cost and for interest cost and from october through december wa for service cost and for interest cost average interest crediting rate for cash balance pension program relate only to the cash balance portion of total pension benefit increase in the weighted average interest crediting rate would increase the pension benefit obligation by we recognize gain and loss on pension and postretirement plan asset and obligation immediately in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income these gain and loss are generally measured annually of december and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumption the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future year discount rate our assumed weighted average discount rate for pension and postretirement benefit of and respectively at december reflects the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow these bond were all rated at least or aa by one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organization denominated in dollar and neither callable convertible nor index linked for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december we decreased our pension discount rate by resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of and decreased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of for the year ended december we increased our pension discount rate by resulting in decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of and increased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of we utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit under this approach we apply discounting using individual spot rate from yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date these spot rate align to each of the projected benefit obligation and service cost cash flow the inc dollar in million except per share amount cost component relates to the active participant in the plan so the relevant cash flow on which to apply the yield curve are considerably longer in duration on average than the total projected benefit obligation cash flow which also include benefit payment to retiree interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate by the corresponding discounted projected benefit obligation cash flow the full yield curve approach reduces any actuarial gain and loss based upon interest rate expectation built in gain in interest cost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario or gain and loss merely resulting from the timing and magnitude of cash outflow associated with our benefit obligation neither the annual measurement of our total benefit obligation nor annual net benefit cost is affected by the full yield curve approach expected long term rate of return in our expected long term rate of return is on pension plan asset and on postretirement plan asset our expected long term rate of return on postretirement plan asset wa adjusted to for from for due to change in the asset mix holding more veba asset in cash and short term fixed income security our long term rate of return reflect the average rate of earnings expected on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the projected benefit obligation in setting the long term assumed rate of return management considers capital market future expectation the asset mix of the plan investment and average historical asset return actual long term return can in relatively stable market also serve factor in determining future expectation we consider many factor that include but are not limited to historical return on plan asset current market information on long term return long term bond rate and current and target asset allocation between asset category the target asset allocation is determined based on consultation with external investment adviser if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that decrease in the expected long term rate of return would cause combined pension and postretirement cost to increase however any difference in the rate and actual return will be included with the actuarial gain or loss recorded in the fourth quarter when our plan are remeasured composite rate of compensation increase our expected composite rate of compensation increase cost of in and reflects the long term average rate of salary increase mortality table at december we updated our assumed mortality rate to reflect our best estimate of future mortality which decreased our pension obligation by and our postretirement obligation by at december we updated our assumed mortality rate which decreased our pension obligation by and our postretirement obligation by healthcare cost trend our healthcare cost trend assumption are developed based on historical cost data the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trend based on historical experience updated expectation of healthcare industry inflation and recent prescription drug cost experience our assumed annual healthcare prescription drug cost trend and medical cost trend for eligible participant will decrease from an annual and ultimate trend rate of to an annual and ultimate trend rate of this change in assumption decreased our obligation by in addition to the healthcare cost trend we assumed an annual growth in administrative expense and an annual growth in dental claim plan asset plan asset consist primarily of private and public equity government and corporate bond and real asset real estate and natural resource the asset allocation of the pension plan are maintained to meet erisa requirement any plan contribution determined by erisa regulation are made to pension trust for the benefit of plan participant we do not have significant erisa required contribution to our pension plan for we maintain veba trust to partially fund postretirement benefit however there are no erisa or regulatory requirement that these postretirement benefit plan be funded annually we made discretionary contribution of to our postretirement plan in december the principal investment objective are to ensure the availability of fund to pay pension and postretirement benefit they become due under broad range of future economic scenario maximize long term investment return with an acceptable level of risk based on our pension and postretirement obligation and diversify broadly across and within the capital market to insulate asset value against adverse experience in any one market each asset class ha broadly diversified characteristic substantial bias toward any particular investing style or type of security are sought to be avoided by managing the aggregation of all account with portfolio benchmark asset and benefit obligation forecasting study
