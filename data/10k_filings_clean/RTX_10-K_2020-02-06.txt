may also give rise to translation gain or loss when financial statement of non operating unit are translated into dollar given that the majority of our sale are non based strengthening of the dollar other major foreign currency could adversely affect our result of operation the majority of sale in the aerospace business are transacted in dollar consistent with established industry practice while the majority of cost at location outside the are incurred in the applicable local currency principally the euro the canadian dollar the british pound and the polish zloty for operating unit with dollar sale and local currency cost there is foreign currency exposure that could impact our result of operation depending on market change in the exchange rate of the dollar against the applicable foreign currency to manage certain exposure we employ long term hedging strategy associated with dollar sale see note and to the consolidated financial statement in our annual report for further discussion of our hedging strategy our international sale and operation are subject to risk associated with change in local government law regulation and policy including those related to tariff and trade barrier investment taxation exchange control capital control employment regulation and repatriation of earnings government policy on international trade and investment such import quota capital control tax or tariff whether adopted by individual government or regional trade bloc can affect demand for our product and service impact the competitive position of our product or prevent from being able to manufacture or sell product in certain country the implementation of more restrictive trade policy including the imposition of tariff or the renegotiation of existing trade agreement by the or by country where we sell large quantity of product and service or procure supply and other material incorporated into our product including in connection with the united kingdom pending withdrawal from the european union could negatively impact our business result of operation and financial condition for example government adoption of buy national policy or retaliation by another government against such policy such tariff could have negative impact on our result of operation our international sale and operation are also sensitive to change in foreign national priority including government budget well to political and economic instability international transaction may involve increased financial and legal risk due to differing legal system and custom in foreign country for example condition of sale or award of contract some international customer require to agree to offset arrangement which may include in country purchase manufacturing and financial support arrangement the contract may provide for penalty in the event we fail to perform in accordance with the offset requirement in addition part of our globalization strategy we have invested in certain country including argentina brazil china india indonesia mexico poland russia south africa turkey ukraine and country in the middle east and central asia that carry high level of currency political compliance and economic risk we expect that sale to these and other emerging market will continue to account for significant portion of our sale our business evolve and these and other developing nation and region around the world increase their demand for our product emerging market operation can present many risk including cultural difference such employment and business practice volatility in gross domestic product economic and government instability the imposition of exchange and capital control and the risk associated with exporting component manufactured in those country for incorporation into finished product completed in other country while these factor and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition of note in the government suspended turkey participation in the joint strike fighter program because turkey accepted delivery of the russian built air and missile defense system the ha imposed and may impose additional sanction on turkey result of this or other political dispute turkish company supply component some of which are sole sourced to our aerospace business for commercial and military engine and aerospace product depending upon the scope and timing of sanction on turkey and potential reciprocal action if any such sanction or action could impact our aerospace business source of supply and could have material adverse effect on our result of operation cash flow or financial condition we use variety of raw material supplier provided part component sub system and contract manufacturing service in our business and significant shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier production or price increase could increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on supplier including third party manufacturing supplier and logistics provider and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material in many instance we depend upon single source of supply manufacturing logistics support or assembly or participate in commodity market that may be subject to allocation of limited supply by supplier disruption in delivery from our supplier supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption supplier quality issue closing or bankruptcy of our supplier price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity could have material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost we believe that our supply management and production practice are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risk and the cost of alternative practice nonetheless price increase supplier capacity constraint supplier production disruption or the unavailability of some raw material may have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition we may not complete the separation transaction or complete them within the time frame we anticipate the separation transaction may present difficulty that could have an adverse effect on and or the independent business resulting from the separation and or cost associated with the separation transaction may be higher than anticipated the independent business may underperform relative to our expectation we may not realize some or all of the expected benefit of the separation transaction in november we announced our intention to separate into three independent company utc an aerospace company comprised of the collins aerospace system and pratt whitney business otis and carrier the proposed separation are expected to be effected through spin offs by utc of otis and carrier that are intended to be tax free for the company shareowner for federal income tax purpose these separation transaction will be subject to utc agreement to consummate the distribution pursuant to and subject to the term and condition of the raytheon merger agreement discussed below well the satisfaction of number of customary condition including among others final approval by utc board of director receipt of tax ruling and tax opinion from external counsel the filing with the sec and effectiveness of form registration statement for otis and carrier and satisfactory completion of financing though utc ha agreed pursuant to and subject to the term and condition of the raytheon merger agreement that utc will consummate separation transaction the failure to satisfy all of the required condition could delay the completion of the separation transaction for significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all additionally the separation transaction are complex in nature and unanticipated development or change including change in law the macroeconomic environment and market condition or regulatory or political condition may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transaction currently expected within the anticipated time frame or at all any change to one or both of the separation transaction or delay in completing one or both of the separation transaction could cause not to realize some or all of the expected benefit or realize them on different timeline than expected in addition the term and condition of the required regulatory authorization and consent that are granted if any may impose requirement limitation or cost or place restriction on the conduct of the independent company or may materially delay the completion of one or both of the separation transaction and although we intend for the separation transaction to be tax free to the company shareowner for federal income tax purpose there can be no assurance that the separation transaction will qualify if the separation transaction were ultimately determined to be taxable we the company shareowner and or the new independent company would incur income tax liability that could be significant furthermore if the separation transaction are completed we can not be assured that each separate company will be successful whether or not the separation transaction are completed our business may face material challenge in connection with these transaction including without limitation the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concern and impact on the business of utc including otis and carrier result of the devotion of management attention to the separation transaction maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employee retaining existing business and operational relationship including with customer supplier employee and other counterparties and attracting new business and operational relationship execution and related risk in connection with utc otis and carrier financing transaction undertaken in connection with the separation transaction foreseen and unforeseen dis synergy cost cost of restructuring transaction including tax and other significant cost and expense potential negative reaction from the financial market if we fail to complete the separation transaction currently expected within the anticipated time frame or at all any of these factor could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and or the price of our common stock in addition if the separation transaction are completed each of the separate company will incur ongoing cost including cost of operating independent company that the separated business will no longer be able to share those cost may exceed our estimate or could diminish the benefit we expect to realize from the separation transaction if the separation transaction are completed utc and the independent business operational and financial profile will change and each will be le diversified company than utc it exists today the separation transaction will result in utc otis and carrier being le diversified company with more limited business concentrated in their respective industry of note even if the combination with raytheon is completed utc business following the expected separation transaction will be significantly more reliant on three customer namely airbus boeing and the government result each company may be more vulnerable to changing market condition which could have material adverse effect on it business financial condition and result of operation in addition the diversification of revenue cost and cash flow will diminish such that each company result of operation cash flow working capital effective tax rate and financing requirement may be subject to increased volatility and it ability to fund capital expenditure and investment pay dividend and service debt may be diminished it is anticipated that the effective tax rate for each separate company will differ from the utc consolidated effective tax rate if the separation transaction are completed there may be change in our shareowner base which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate investor holding our common stock may hold our common stock because of decision to invest in company that operates in multiple market with diversified portfolio if the separation transaction are completed share of our common stock will represent an investment in business concentrated in the commercial aerospace and defense industry and share of the common stock of the new independent company conducting the otis and carrier business will represent investment in business concentrated in their respective industry these change may not match some shareowner investment strategy which could cause them to sell their share of our common stock or the common stock of the new independent company and excessive selling pressure could cause the market price to decrease following the consummation of the separation transaction additionally we can not predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent company after the separation transaction will be in the aggregate le than equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transaction we may not complete the combination with raytheon or complete the combination within the time frame we anticipate the combined business may underperform relative to our expectation the combination may cause our financial result to differ from our expectation or the expectation of the investment community we may not be able to achieve anticipated cost saving or other anticipated benefit the completion of the combination with raytheon is subject to number of condition the failure to satisfy all of the required condition could delay the completion of the combination for significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all any delay in completing the combination could cause utc not to realize some or all of the benefit that utc expects to achieve if the combination is successfully completed within the expected timeframe or could cause utc to realize such benefit on different timeline than expected in addition the term and condition of the required regulatory authorization and consent for the combination that are granted if any may impose requirement limitation or cost or place restriction on the conduct of the combined company business or may materially delay the completion of the combination moreover the completion of the combination is subject to among other condition the completion of the spin offs of otis and carrier which are subject to number of condition subject to utc agreement to consummate the distribution pursuant to and subject to the term and condition of the raytheon merger agreement any delay in or prevention of the completion of the spin offs could delay or prevent the completion of the combination the success of the combination will depend in part on the combined company ability to successfully combine and integrate the business of utc and raytheon and realize the anticipated benefit including synergy cost saving innovation opportunity and operational efficiency from the combination if the combined company is unable to achieve these objective within the anticipated time frame or at all the anticipated benefit may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected and the value of the combined company common stock may decline integration of the two company may result in material challenge including without limitation managing larger combined aerospace system and defense business maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employee retaining existing business and operational relationship including customer supplier and employee and other counterparties may be impacted by contract containing consent and or other provision that may be triggered by the combination and attracting new business and operational relationship the possibility of faulty assumption underlying expectation regarding the integration process the possibility of significant cost involved in connection with completing the merger including cost to achieve expected synergy consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and eliminating duplicative operation coordinating geographically separate organization unanticipated issue in integrating information technology communication and other system and unforeseen expense or delay associated with the combination we engage in acquisition and divestiture and may encounter difficulty integrating acquired business with or disposing of divested business from our current operation therefore we may not realize the anticipated benefit of these acquisition and divestiture we seek to grow through strategic acquisition in addition to internal growth in the past several year we have made various acquisition including the acquisition of rockwell collins in november and have entered into joint venture intended to complement and expand our business we expect to continue to undertake such transaction in the future our due diligence review may not identify all of the material issue necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential loss contingency of particular transaction including potential exposure to regulatory sanction resulting from an acquisition target previous activity for example we may incur unanticipated cost expense or other liability result of an acquisition target violation of applicable law such the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa or similar anti bribery and corruption law in non jurisdiction we also may incur unanticipated cost or expense including post closing asset impairment charge expense associated with eliminating duplicate facility litigation and other liability we also may encounter difficulty in integrating acquired business including the rockwell collins business with our operation applying our internal control process to these acquired business or in managing strategic investment additionally we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit we anticipate when we first enter into transaction any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and result of operation in addition accounting requirement relating to business combination including the requirement to expense certain acquisition cost incurred may cause to incur greater earnings volatility and generally lower earnings during period in which we acquire new business furthermore we make strategic divestiture from time to time our divestiture may result in continued financial exposure to the divested business such through guarantee or other financial arrangement continued supply and service arrangement or potential litigation following the transaction under these arrangement nonperformance by those divested business could result in obligation being imposed on that could have material adverse effect on our competitive position cash flow result of operation or financial condition the success of future acquisition and divestiture will depend on the satisfaction of condition precedent to and consummation of the pending transaction the timing of consummation of these pending transaction and the ability of the party to secure any required regulatory approval in timely manner among other thing we also enter into joint venture in which we maintain significant influence do not control the business accordingly our ability to apply our internal control and compliance policy to these business is limited and can result in additional financial and reputational risk our debt level and related debt service obligation could have negative consequence our ability to access debt may be affected by our increased indebtedness change in global capital market our financial performance or outlook the expected separation transaction or our credit rating we have outstanding debt and other financial obligation and significant unused borrowing capacity in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition we issued billion of aggregate principal note and billion of rockwell collins debt remained outstanding at the time of the closing of the acquisition expected the completion of the acquisition resulted in downgrade of utc long term issuer credit rating by one notch following the announcement of the expected separation transaction one credit agency placed utc long term issuer credit rating on negative outlook the expected separation transaction and the increased indebtedness of utc in connection with the rockwell collins acquisition may have the effect of among other thing requiring to dedicate significant cash flow from operation to the payment of principal and interest on our debt or the payment of cost associated with the separation transaction which will reduce fund we have available other purpose such acquisition reinvestment in our business dividend and repurchase of our common stock reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and market condition exposing to interest rate risk at the time the outstanding debt is refinanced or on the portion of our debt obligation that are issued at variable rate and further downgrade of our credit rating resulting in increased borrowing cost we depend in part upon the issuance of debt to fund our operation if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitment or meet other business requirement our market liquidity may not be sufficient number of factor could cause to incur increased borrowing cost and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private market for debt including disruption or decline in the global capital market and or decline in our financial performance outlook or credit rating quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase may be discontinued or modified are subject to number of uncertainty and may affect the price of our common stock quarterly cash dividend and share repurchase under our share repurchase program constitute component of our capital allocation strategy which we fund with operating free cash flow borrowing and divestiture however we are not required to declare dividend or make any share repurchase under our share repurchase program dividend and share repurchase may be discontinued accelerated suspended or delayed at any time without prior notice even if not discontinued the amount of such dividend and repurchase may be changed including in connection with the separation transaction and the raytheon merger and the amount timing and frequency of such dividend and repurchase may vary from historical practice or from the company stated expectation decision with respect to dividend and share repurchase are subject to the discretion of our board of director and will be based on variety of factor important factor that could cause to discontinue limit suspend increase or delay our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase include market condition the price of our common stock the nature and timing of other investment opportunity change in our business strategy the term of our financing arrangement our outlook to the ability to obtain financing at attractive rate the impact on our credit rating and the availability of domestic cash to help manage the cash flow and liquidity impact resulting from the rockwell collins acquisition and the proposed separation transaction we have limited our share repurchase our ability to repurchase share is also restricted by the raytheon merger agreement the reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally there can be no assurance that any share repurchase will enhance shareholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the level at which we repurchased share of common stock although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long term shareholder value short term stock price fluctuation could reduce the program effectiveness see item market for registrant common equity related stockholder matter and issuer purchase of equity security in this form for description of our share repurchase program and past share repurchase we design manufacture and service product that incorporate advanced technology the introduction of new product and technology involves risk and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated we seek to achieve growth through the design development production sale and support of innovative product that incorporate advanced technology the product program and service need of our customer change and evolve regularly and we invest substantial amount in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service of particular note pratt whitney is currently producing and delivering the geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft including the family of aircraft the level of order received for the geared turbofan family of engine coupled with requirement to achieve mature production level in short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production ramp effort are delayed if supplier can not timely deliver or perform to our standard and or if we identify or experience issue with in service engine we may not meet customer delivery schedule which could result in material additional cost including liquidated damage or other liability that could be assessed under existing contract our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of our technological advancement depends on variety of factor including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedule execution of internal and external performance plan availability of supplier and internally produced part and material performance of supplier and subcontractor availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul service on our product hiring and training of qualified personnel achieving cost and production efficiency identification of emerging technological trend in our target end market validation of innovative technology the level customer interest in new technology and product and customer acceptance of product we manufacture or that incorporate technology we develop for example our customer manufacture end product and larger aerospace system that incorporate certain of our aerospace product these system and end product may also incorporate additional technology manufactured by third party and involve additional risk and uncertainty result the performance and market acceptance of these larger system and end product could affect the level of customer interest and acceptance of our product in the marketplace development effort divert resource from other potential investment in our business and these effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering in addition the market for our product or product that incorporate our technology may not develop or grow we anticipate we or our customer supplier or subcontractor may encounter difficulty in developing and producing new product and service and may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequence due to the design complexity of our product or those of our customer or third party manufacturer that incorporate our product into or our customer product we may experience delay in completing the development and introduction of new product or we may experience the suspension of production after these product enter into service due to safety concern delay and or suspension of production could result in increased development cost or deflect resource from other project in particular we can not predict with certainty whether when and in quantity our aerospace business will produce and sell aircraft engine aircraft system and component and other product currently in development pending required certification or after entry into service our contract are typically awarded on competitive basis our bid are based upon among other item the cost to provide the product and service to generate an acceptable return on our investment in these contract we must be able to accurately estimate our cost to provide the service and deliver the product and to be able to complete the contract in timely manner if we fail to accurately estimate our cost or the time required to complete contract the profitability of our contract may be materially and adversely affected some of our contract provide for liquidated damage in the event that we are unable to perform and deliver in accordance with the contractual specification and schedule in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction target that could have material adverse effect on the profitability of our contract if thesis target are not achieved when required furthermore our competitor including our customer may develop competing technology which gain market acceptance in advance of or instead of our product the possibility also exists that our competitor or customer might develop new technology or offering that might cause our existing technology and offering to become obsolete in addition the possibility exists that competitor or customer will develop aftermarket service and aftermarket part for our product which attract customer and adversely impact our return on investment on new product any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition our business may be affected by government contracting risk most of our contract with the government are fixed price which subject to the risk of reduced margin or loss if we are unable to achieve estimated cost performance improvement or efficiency government contract are subject to termination by the government either for convenience or for default if terminated for convenience we generally would be entitled to recover payment for work completed and certain termination cost if terminated for default the government would pay only for the work that ha been accepted and could require to pay the difference the original contract price and the cost to re procure the undelivered good or service from another source well other damage resulting from the default we are and believe that in light of the current government contracting environment we will continue to be the subject of government investigation relating to our government contract such government investigation often take year to complete and could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including repayment fine treble and other damage forfeiture restitution or penalty or could lead to suspension or debarment of government contracting or of export privilege for instance if we or one of our business unit were charged with wrongdoing in connection with government investigation including fraud or violation of certain environmental or export law further described below the government could suspend from bidding on or receiving award of new government contract pending the completion of legal proceeding if convicted or found liable the government could fine and debar from new government contracting for period generally not to exceed three year and could void any contract found to be tainted by fraud we also could suffer reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against even if such allegation are later determined to be unsubstantiated many defense contractor our contract with the government are subject to audit and we have received audit report recommending the reduction of certain contract price because for example cost or pricing data or cost accounting practice used to price and negotiate those contract may not have conformed to government regulation some of these audit report recommend that certain payment be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amount which could if the audit report theory were to prevail in litigation increase the cost absorbed by our commercial engine business in the future we have made voluntary refund in those case we believe appropriate have settled some allegation and in some case continue to negotiate and or litigate the company may be and ha been required to make payment into escrow of disputed liability while the related litigation is pending if the litigation is resolved in the company favor any such payment will be returned to the company with interest export of certain of our product are subject to

country result our ability to export our product or service to certain country or for particular end us or end user may require authorization any failure by or our customer or supplier to comply with these law and regulation could result in civil or criminal penalty fine seizure of our product adverse publicity restriction on our ability to export our product or the suspension or debarment from business with the government moreover any change in export control or sanction regulation may further restrict the export of our product or service and the possibility of such change requires constant monitoring to ensure we remain compliant the length of time required by the licensing process can vary potentially delaying the shipment of product or performance of service and the recognition of the corresponding revenue any restriction on the export of our product or product line could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation cash flow or financial condition
