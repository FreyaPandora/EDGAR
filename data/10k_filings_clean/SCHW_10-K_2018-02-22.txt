quoted price in active market to measure the fair value of asset and liability when utilizing market data and bid ask spread we use the price within the bid ask spread that best represents fair value when quoted price do not exist price are obtained from independent third party pricing service to measure the fair value of investment asset we generally obtain price from at least three independent

yield for similar type of security benchmark interest rate plus observable spread and weighted average maturity for the same or similar to be issued security the price obtained from it primary independent pricing service are compared to the price obtained from the additional independent pricing service to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is

because of the complexity of tax law and regulation interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific fact and circumstance change in the estimate of accrued tax occur

interest in the entity constitutes controlling financial interest under either the variable interest entity vie model or the voting interest entity voe model in evaluating whether schwab interest in vie is controlling financial interest we consider whether our involvement in the context of the design purpose and risk of the vie well any involvement of related party provides with the power to direct the most significant activity of the vie and ii the obligation to absorb loss or receive benefit that are significant to the vie if both of these condition exist then schwab would be the

quarterly basis debt security with unrealized loss are considered otti if the company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery if management determines that security is otti under these circumstance the impairment recognized in earnings is measured the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value the charles schwab corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement tabular amount in million except per share data option price amount ratio or noted security is also otti if management doe not expect to recover all of the amortized cost of the security in this circumstance the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flow and the amortized cost of the security where appropriate model are utilized to estimate the credit loss on discounted cash flow basis using the security effective interest rate the evaluation of whether we expect to recover the amortized cost of security is inherently judgmental the evaluation considers multiple factor including the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss the financial condition of the issuer the payment structure of the security external credit rating our internal credit rating for asset backed security the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit loss on the underlying collateral recent event specific to the issuer and the issuer industry

interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayment additionally loan are recorded net of an allowance for loan loss the loan portfolio includes four loan type first mortgage helocs pal and other loan we use these segment when developing and documenting our methodology for determining the allowance for loan loss pal are collateralized by marketable security with liquid market credit line are over collateralized dependent on the type of security pledged collateral market value is monitored on daily basis and borrower committed line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified level such the loss inherent within this portfolio is limited schwab record an allowance for loan loss through charge to earnings based on our estimate of probable loss in the existing portfolio we review the allowance for loan loss quarterly taking into consideration current economic condition the composition of the existing loan portfolio past loss experience and risk inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for loan loss is maintained at an appropriate level the methodology to establish an allowance for loan loss utilizes statistical model that estimate prepayment default and probable loss for the loan segment based on predicted behavior of individual loan within the segment the methodology considers the effect of borrower behavior and variety of factor including but not limited to interest rate housing price movement measured by housing price index economic condition estimated default and foreclosure measured by historical and expected delinquency change in prepayment speed ltv ratio past loss experience estimate of future loss severity borrower credit risk and the adequacy of collateral the methodology also evaluates concentration in the loan type including loan product within those type year of origination and geographical distribution of collateral probable loss are forecast using loan level simulation of the delinquency status of the loan over the term of the loan the simulation start with the current relevant risk indicator including the current delinquent status of each loan the estimated current ltv ratio estimated current ltv of each loan the term and structure of each loan current key interest rate including treasury and libor rate and borrower fico score the more significant variable in the simulation include delinquency roll rate loss severity housing price and interest rate delinquency roll rate the rate at which loan transition through delinquency stage and ultimately result in loss are estimated from our historical loss experience adjusted for current trend and market information loss severity estimate are based on our historical loss experience and the charles schwab corporationnotes to consolidated financial statement tabular amount in million except per share data option price amount ratio or noted market trend the estimated loss severity loss given default used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for heloc loan is higher than that used in the methodology for first mortgage housing price trend are derived from historical home price index and econometric forecast of future home value factor affecting the home price index include housing inventory unemployment interest rate and inflation expectation interest rate projection are based on the current term structure of interest rate and historical volatility to project various possible future interest rate path this methodology result in loss factor that are applied to the outstanding balance to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan type schwab considers loan modification in which it make an economic concession to borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be troubled debt restructurings tdrs nonaccrual nonperforming and impaired loansfirst mortgage helocs pal and other loan are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming day past due to interest or principal unless the loan are well secured and in the process of collection or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain including loan to borrower who have filed for bankruptcy heloc loan secured by second lien are placed on non accrual status if the associated first lien is day or more delinquent regardless of the payment status of the heloc when loan is placed on nonaccrual status the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status generally nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates sustained period of performance or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful loan on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming asset nonaccrual loan other real estate owned and tdrs are considered impaired asset it is probable we will not collect all amount due loan charge offsthe company charge off loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and record reduction in the allowance for loan loss and the loan balance our charge off policy for first mortgage and heloc loan
