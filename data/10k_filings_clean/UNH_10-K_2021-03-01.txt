cost for our customer in return for monthly premium we generally use approximately to of our premium revenue to pay the cost of health care service delivered to these customer the profitability of our

premium revenue from risk based product comprise nearly of our total consolidated revenue if we fail to predict accurately or effectively price for or manage the cost of providing care under risk based arrangement our result of operation could be materially and adversely affected we manage medical cost through underwriting criterion product design negotiation of competitive provider contract and care management program total medical cost are affected by the number of individual service rendered the cost of each service and the type of service rendered our premium revenue on commercial policy and medicaid contract is typically based on fixed monthly rate per individual served for month period and is generally priced one to six month before the contract commences our revenue on medicare policy is based on bid submitted to cm in june the year before the contract year although we base the commercial and medicaid premium we charge and our medicare bid on our estimate of future medical cost over the fixed contract period many factor may cause actual cost to exceed those estimated and reflected in premium or bid these factor may include medical cost inflation increased use of service increased cost of individual service large scale medical emergency pandemic such covid the introduction of new or costly drug treatment and technology new treatment guideline new mandated benefit such the expansion of essential benefit coverage or other regulatory change and insured population characteristic relatively small difference between predicted and actual medical cost or of contentsutilization rate percentage of revenue can result in significant change in our financial result for example if our medical cost for commercial insured product been higher than our actual medical cost without proportionally higher revenue from such product our annual net earnings for would have been reduced by approximately million excluding any offsetting impact from risk adjustment

which we have already paid the provider further payment or other dispute between primary care provider and specialist with the primary care provider contract could result in disruption in the provision of service to our member or reduction in the service available to our member health care provider with which we contract may not properly manage the cost of service maintain financial solvency or avoid dispute with other provider any of these event could have material adverse effect on the provision of service to our member and our operation some provider render service to our member who do not have contract with in those case we do not have pre established understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for service rendered to our member in some state the amount of compensation due to these out of network provider is defined by law or regulation but in most instance the amount is either not defined or is established by standard which doe not clearly specify dollar term in some instance provider may believe they are underpaid for their service and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with or try to recover from our member the difference between we have paid them and the amount they charged the success of some of our business including optumhealth and unitedhealthcare global depend on maintaining satisfactory relationship with physician our employee independent contractor or joint venture partner the physician who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organization could terminate their provider contract or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with we face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the market where we operate to acquire or manage physician practice or to employ or contract with individual physician if we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationship with physician or to acquire recruit or in some instance employ physician or to retain enrollee following the departure of physician our revenue could be materially and adversely affected in addition our affiliated physician organization contract with competitor of unitedhealthcare our business could suffer if our affiliated physician organization fail to maintain relationship with these company or fail to adequately price their contract with these third party payer in addition physician hospital pharmaceutical benefit service provider pharmaceutical manufacturer and certain health care provider are customer of our optum business physician also provide medical service at facility owned by our optum business given the importance of health care provider and other constituent to our business failure to maintain satisfactory relationship with them could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow we are routinely subject to various legal action due to the nature of our business which could damage our reputation and if resolved unfavorably could result in substantial penalty or monetary damage and materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow we are routinely made party to variety of legal action related to among other matter the design management and delivery of our product and service offering these matter have included or could in the

have contractual relationship with or serve provider to our managed care network whistleblower claim including claim under the false claim act or similar statute contract and labor dispute tax claim and claim related to disclosure of certain business practice we may also be party to certain class action lawsuit brought by health care professional group and consumer in addition we operate in jurisdiction outside of the united state where contractual right tax position and applicable regulation may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to greater degree than in the united state and therefore subject to dispute by customer government authority or others we are largely self insured with regard to litigation risk while we maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carrier for claim in excess of our self insurance certain type of damage such punitive damage in some circumstance are not covered by insurance although we record of contentsliabilities for our estimate of the probable cost resulting from self insured matter it is possible the level of actual loss will significantly exceed the liability recorded we can not predict the outcome of significant legal action in which we are involved and are incurring expense in resolving these matter the legal action we face or may face in the future could further increase our cost of business and materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow in addition certain legal action could result in adverse publicity which could damage our reputation and materially and adversely affect our ability to retain our current business or grow our market share in some market and business any failure by to manage successfully our strategic alliance or complete manage or integrate acquisition and other significant strategic transaction or relationship domestically or outside the united state could materially and adversely affect our business prospect result of operation financial position and cash flow part of our business strategy we frequently engage in discussion with third party regarding possible investment acquisition divestiture strategic alliance joint venture and outsourcing transaction and often enter into agreement relating to such transaction for example we have strategic alliance with aarp under which we provide aarp branded medicare supplement insurance to aarp member and other aarp branded product and service to medicare beneficiary if we fail to meet the need of our alliance or joint venture partner including by developing additional product and service providing high level of service pricing our product and service competitively or responding effectively to applicable federal and state regulatory change our alliance and joint venture could be damaged or terminated which in turn could adversely impact our reputation business and result of operation further if we fail to identify and successfully complete transaction which further our strategic objective we may be required to expend resource to develop product and technology internally we may be placed at competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perception any of which may have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial position or cash flow success in completing acquisition is also dependent on effectively integrating the acquired business into our existing operation including our internal control environment and culture or otherwise leveraging it operation which may present challenge different from those presented by organic growth and may be difficult for to manage in addition even with appropriate diligence pre acquisition practice of an acquired business may expose to legal challenge and investigation for example in january an indictment for alleged violation of antitrust law wa issued by the doj against our subsidiary surgical care affiliate sca based on conduct alleged to have begun more than five year prior to our acquisition we are vigorously defending this lawsuit but if sca is found liable we may be subject to criminal fine or reputational harm if we can not successfully integrate these acquisition and realize contemplated revenue growth opportunity and cost saving our business prospect result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected we expand and operate our business outside of the united state we are presented with challenge differing from those presented by acquisition of domestic business including challenge in adapting to new market language business labor and cultural practice and regulatory environment adapting to these challenge could require to devote significant senior management attention and other resource to the acquired business before we realize anticipated synergy or other benefit from the acquired business these challenge vary widely by country and outside of the united state may include political instability government intervention discriminatory regulation and currency exchange control or other restriction which could prevent from transferring fund from these operation out of the country in which our acquired business operate or converting local currency we hold into dollar or other currency if we are unable to manage successfully our non acquisition our business prospect result of operation and financial position could be materially and adversely affected foreign currency exchange rate and fluctuation may have an impact on our shareholder equity from period to period which could adversely affect our debt to debt plus equity ratio and our future revenue cost and cash flow from international operation any measure we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currency may be costly or ineffective our sale performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract retain and provide support to network of independent producer and consultant our product and service are sold in part through nonexclusive producer and consultant for whose service and allegiance we must compete our sale would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain and support such independent producer and consultant or if our sale strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channel our relationship with producer could be materially and adversely impacted by change in our business practice and the nature of our relationship to address these pressure including potential reduction in commission level unfavorable economic condition could materially and adversely affect our revenue and our result of operation unfavorable economic condition may impact demand for certain of our product and service for example high unemployment ha caused lower enrollment or lower rate of renewal in our employer group benefit and pharmacy service of contentsplans unfavorable economic condition also have caused and could continue to cause employer to stop offering certain health care coverage an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on voluntary employee funded basis mean to reduce their operating cost in addition unfavorable economic condition could adversely impact our ability to increase premium or result in the cancellation by certain customer of our product and service these condition could lead to decrease in our membership level and premium and fee revenue and could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow during prolonged unfavorable economic environment state and federal budget could be materially and adversely affected resulting in reduced reimbursement or payment in our federal and state government health care coverage program including medicare medicaid and chip reduction in state medicaid reimbursement rate could be implemented retroactively to apply to payment already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow in addition state and federal budgetary pressure could cause the affected government to impose new or higher level of tax or assessment for our commercial program such premium tax on health insurance and surcharge or fee on select fee for service and capitated medical claim any of these development or action could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospital and other care provider which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rate with these party and increase our medical cost or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our

materially and adversely affect optum financial result our failure to attract develop retain and manage the succession of key employee and executive could adversely affect our business result of operation and future performance we are dependent on our ability to attract develop and retain qualified employee and executive including those with diverse background experience and skill set to operate and expand our business experienced and highly skilled employee and executive in the health care and technology industry are in high demand and the market for their service is extremely competitive we may have difficulty in replacing key executive because of the limited number of qualified individual in these industry with the breadth of skill and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business in addition we believe our corporate culture foster integrity compassion relationship innovation and performance adverse change to our corporate culture could harm our business operation and our ability to retain key employee and executive while we have development and succession plan in place for our key employee and executive these plan do not guarantee the service of our key employee and executive will continue to be available to if we are unable to attract develop retain and effectively manage the development and succession plan for key employee and executive our business result of operation and future performance could be adversely affected our investment portfolio may suffer loss which could adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow market fluctuation could impair our profitability and capital position volatility in interest rate affect our interest income and the market value of our investment in debt security of varying maturity which constitute the vast majority of the fair value of our investment of december relatively low interest rate on investment such those experienced during recent year have adversely impacted our investment income in addition delay in payment of principal or interest by issuer or default by issuer primarily issuer of our investment in corporate and municipal bond could reduce our investment income and require to write the value of our investment which could adversely affect our profitability and equity there can be no assurance our investment will produce total positive return or we will not sell investment at price which are le than their carrying value change in the value of our investment asset result of interest rate fluctuation change in issuer financial condition illiquidity or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our equity in addition if it became necessary for to liquidate our investment portfolio on an accelerated basis such an action could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and the capital position of our regulated subsidiary of contentsif the value of our intangible asset is materially impaired our result of operation equity and credit rating could be materially and adversely affected of december our goodwill and other intangible asset had carrying value of billion representing of our total consolidated asset we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible asset to determine whether all or portion of their carrying value may be impaired in which case charge to earnings may be necessary the value of our goodwill may be materially and adversely impacted if business we acquire perform in manner inconsistent with our assumption in addition from time to time we divest business and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charge including those related to goodwill and other intangible asset any future evaluation requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible asset could materially and adversely affect our result of operation and equity in the period in which the impairment occurs material decrease in equity could in turn adversely affect our credit rating if we are not able to protect our proprietary right to our database software and related product our ability to market our knowledge and information related business could be hindered and our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected we rely on our agreement with customer confidentiality agreement with employee and third party and our trademark trade secret copyright and patent to protect our proprietary right these legal protection and precaution may not prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information in addition substantial litigation regarding intellectual property right exists in the software industry and we expect software product to be increasingly subject to third party infringement claim the number of product and competitor in this industry segment grows such litigation and misappropriation of our proprietary information could hinder our ability to market and sell product and service and our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected any downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation claim paying ability financial strength and debt rating by nationally recognized statistical rating organization are important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance company rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used by customer and creditor we believe our claim paying ability and financial strength rating are important factor in marketing our product to certain of our customer our credit rating impact both the cost and availability of future borrowing each of the credit rating agency review it rating periodically our rating reflect each credit rating agency opinion of our financial strength operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligation or obligation to policyholder there can be no

otherwise materially increase our operating cost risk related to the regulation of our businessour business activity are highly regulated and new law or regulation or change in existing law or regulation or their enforcement or application could materially and adversely affect our business we are regulated by federal state and local government in the united state and other country where we do business our insurance and hmo subsidiary must be licensed by and are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they conduct business for example state require periodic financial report

certain insurance company can be assessed to prescribed limit for certain obligation to the policyholder and claimant of impaired or insolvent insurance company who write the line or similar line of business any such assessment could expose our insurance entity and other insurer to the risk they would be required to pay portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company claim through state guaranty association certain of our business provide product or service to various government agency for example some of our optum and unitedhealthcare business hold government contract or provide service related to government contract and are subject to federal and state and non self referral anti kickback medical necessity risk adjustment false claim and other law and regulation governing government contractor and the use of government fund our relationship with these government agency are subject to the term of contract we hold with the agency and to law and regulation regarding

optum business are also subject to regulation distinct from those faced by our insurance and hmo subsidiary some of which could impact our relationship with physician hospital and customer these regulation include state telemedicine regulation debt collection law banking regulation distributor and producer licensing requirement state corporate practice of medicine doctrine fee splitting rule and health care facility licensure and certificate of need requirement these risk and uncertainty may materially and adversely affect our ability to market or provide our product and service or to do so at targeted operating margin or may increase the regulatory burden under which we operate the law and rule governing our business and interpretation of those law and rule are subject to frequent change for example legislative administrative and public policy change to the aca are being considered and we can not predict if the aca will be further modified litigation challenge have been brought seeking to invalidate the aca in whole or in part federal appeal court struck down the aca in part unconstitutional in during the fourth quarter of the supreme court heard oral argument in the case further the integration into our business of entity we acquire may affect the way in which existing law and rule apply to including by subjecting to law and rule which not previously apply to the broad latitude given to the agency administering interpreting and enforcing current and future regulation governing our business could force to change how we do business restrict revenue and enrollment growth increase our health care and administrative cost and capital requirement or expose to increased liability in court for coverage determination contract interpretation and other action we also must obtain and maintain regulatory approval to market many of our product and service increase price for certain regulated product and service and complete certain acquisition and disposition or integrate certain acquisition for example premium rate for our health insurance and managed care product are subject to regulatory review or approval in many state and by the federal government additionally we must submit data on all proposed rate increase on many of our product to hhs for monitoring purpose geographic and product expansion of our business may be subject to state and federal regulatory approval delay in obtaining necessary approval or our failure to obtain or maintain adequate approval could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and

other matter local and cross border taxation licensing tariff intellectual property investment capital including minimum solvency margin and reserve requirement management control labor anti fraud anti corruption and privacy and data protection regulation including requirement for cross border data transfer which vary by jurisdiction we currently operate outside of the united state and in the future may acquire or commence additional business based outside of the united state increasing our exposure to non regulatory regime for example our unitedhealthcare global business subject to brazilian law and regulation affecting hospital managed care and insurance industry and to regulation by brazilian regulator including the national regulatory agency for private health insurance and plan the agência nacional de saúde suplementar while our banmédica business is subject to chilean colombian and peruvian law regulation and regulator applicable to hospital and private insurance any

business and operation are subject to law regulating the conduct and activity of based business operating abroad such the fcpa which prohibits offering promising providing or authorizing others to give anything of value to foreign government official to obtain or retain business or otherwise secure business advantage our failure to comply with or non law and regulation governing our conduct outside the united state or to establish constructive relation with non regulator could adversely affect our ability to market our product and service or to do so at targeted operating margin which may have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation the health care industry is regularly subject to negative publicity including result of governmental

amount of reimbursement or payment level reduce our participation in certain service area or market or increase our administrative or medical cost under such program revenue for these program depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state government and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanism funding for these government program depends on many factor outside of our control including general economic condition and budgetary constraint at the federal or applicable state level for example cm ha in the past reduced or frozen medicare advantage benchmark and additional cut to medicare advantage benchmark are possible in addition from time to time cm make change to the way it calculates medicare advantage risk adjustment payment although we have adjusted member benefit and premium on selective basis ceased to offer benefit plan in certain county and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reduction and other funding pressure these or other strategy may not fully address the funding pressure in the medicare advantage program in addition payer in the medicare advantage program may be subject to reduction in payment from cm result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit under the medicaid managed care program state medicaid agency seek bid from eligible health plan to continue their participation in the acute care medicaid health program if we are not successful in obtaining renewal of state medicaid managed care contract we risk losing the member who were enrolled in those medicaid plan under the medicare part program to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income member our bid must result in an enrollee premium below regional benchmark which is calculated by the government after all regional bid are submitted if the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark we risk losing the member who were auto assigned to and will

chronic illness management handling of appeal and customer satisfaction plan must have rating of four star or higher to qualify for bonus payment if we do not maintain or continue to improve our star rating our plan may not be eligible for quality bonus and we may experience negative impact on our revenue and the benefit our plan can offer which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plan our membership level result of operation financial position and cash flow any change in standard or care delivery model applying to government health care program including medicare and medicaid or our inability to improve our quality score and star rating to meet government performance requirement or to match the performance of our competitor could result in limitation to our participation in or exclusion from these or other government program which in turn could materially and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow cm us various payment mechanism to allocate funding for medicare program including adjustment of monthly capitation payment to medicare advantage plan and medicare part plan according to the predicted health status

note to the consolidated financial statement in part ii item financial statement for discussion of new accounting pronouncement which affect critical accounting estimatescritical accounting estimate are those estimate requiring management to make challenging subjective or complex judgment often because they must estimate the effect of matter inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent period critical accounting estimate involve judgment and uncertainty which are sufficiently sensitive and may result in materially different result under different assumption and condition medical cost payablemedical cost and medical cost payable include estimate of our obligation for medical care service rendered on behalf of insured consumer but for which claim have either not yet been received or processed depending on the health care professional and type of service the typical billing lag for service can be up to day from the date of service approximately of claim related to medical care service are known and settled within day from the date of service and substantially all within twelve month of december our day outstanding in medical payable wa day calculated total medical payable divided by total medical cost time the number of day in the period in each reporting period our operating result include the effect of more completely developed medical cost payable estimate associated with previously reported period if the revised estimate of prior period medical cost is le than the previous estimate we will decrease reported medical cost in the current period favorable development if the revised estimate of prior period medical cost is more than the previous estimate we will increase reported medical cost in the current period unfavorable development medical cost in and included favorable medical cost development related to prior year of million million and million respectively in developing our medical cost payable estimate we apply different estimation method depending on the month for which incurred claim are being estimated for example for the most recent two month we estimate claim cost incurred by applying of contentsobserved medical cost trend factor to the average per member per month pmpm medical cost incurred in prior month for which more complete claim data is available supplemented by review of near term completion factor completion factor completion factor is an actuarial estimate based upon historical experience and analysis of current trend of the percentage of incurred claim during given period adjudicated by at the date of estimation completion factor are the most significant factor we use in developing our medical cost payable estimate for period prior to the most recent two month completion factor include judgment in relation to claim submission such the time from date of service to claim receipt claim level and processing cycle well other factor our judgment also consider the impact of covid on these factor if actual claim submission rate from provider which can be influenced by number of factor including provider mix and electronic versus manual submission or our claim processing pattern are different than estimated our reserve estimate may be significantly impacted the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factor and the estimated potential impact on our medical cost payable estimate for those period of december completion factor decrease increase in factorsincrease decrease in medical cost payable in million medical cost per member per month trend factor medical cost pmpm trend factor are significant factor we use in developing our medical cost payable estimate for the most recent two month medical cost trend factor are developed through comprehensive analysis of claim incurred in prior month provider contracting and expected unit cost benefit design and review of broad set of health care utilization indicator which included consideration of covid in these factor include but are not limited to pharmacy utilization trend inpatient hospital authorization data and influenza incidence data from the national center for disease control we also consider macroeconomic variable such gdp growth employment and disposable income large number of factor can cause the medical cost trend to vary from our estimate including our ability and practice to manage medical and pharmaceutical cost change in level and mix of service utilized mix of benefit offered including the impact of co pay and deductible change in medical practice catastrophe epidemic and pandemic such covid the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factor and the estimated potential impact on our medical cost payable estimate for the most recent two month of december medical cost pmpm quarterly trendincrease decrease in factorsincrease decrease in medical cost payable in million the completion factor and medical cost pmpm trend factor analysis include outcome considered reasonably likely based on our historical experience estimating liability for incurred but not reported benefit claim management belief the amount of medical cost payable is reasonable and adequate to cover our liability for unpaid claim of december however actual claim payment may differ from established estimate discussed above assuming hypothetical difference between our december estimate of medical cost payable and actual medical cost payable excluding aarp medicare supplement insurance and any potential offsetting impact from premium rebate net earnings would have increased or decreased by approximately million for more detail related to our medical cost estimate see note of the note to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement of contentsgoodwillwe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstance change indicating the carrying value may not be recoverable when testing goodwill for impairment we may first ass qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value during qualitative analysis we consider the impact of change if any to the following factor macroeconomic industry and market factor cost factor change in overall financial performance and any other relevant event and uncertainty impacting reporting unit if our qualitative assessment indicates goodwill impairment is more likely than not we perform additional quantitative analysis we may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing for reporting unit where quantitative analysis is performed we perform test measuring the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing them to their aggregate carrying value including goodwill if the fair value is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit an impairment is recognized for the difference up to the carrying amount of goodwill we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow method or weighted combination of discounted cash flow and market based method the discounted cash flow method includes assumption about wide variety of internal and external factor significant assumption used in the discounted cash flow method include financial projection of free cash flow including revenue trend medical cost trend operating productivity income tax and capital level long term growth rate for determining terminal value beyond the discretely forecasted period and discount rate financial projection and long term growth rate used for our reporting unit are consistent with and use input from our internal long term business plan and strategy discount rate are determined for each reporting unit and include consideration of the implied risk inherent in their forecast our most significant estimate in the discount rate determination involves our adjustment to the peer company weighted average cost of capital reflecting reporting unit specific factor we have not made any adjustment to decrease discount rate below the calculated peer company weighted average cost of capital for any reporting unit company specific adjustment to discount rate are subjective and thus are difficult to measure with certainty the passage of time and the availability of additional information regarding area of uncertainty with respect to the reporting unit operation could cause these assumption to change in the future additionally part of our quantitative impairment testing we perform various sensitivity analysis on certain key assumption such discount rate cash flow projection and peer company multiple to analyze the potential for material impact the market based method requires determination of appropriate peer group whose security are traded on an active market the peer group is used to derive market multiple to estimate fair value of october we completed our annual impairment test for goodwill with all of our reporting unit having fair value substantially in excess of their carrying value legal mattersa description of our legal proceeding is presented in

available the company obtains one price for each security primarily from third party pricing service pricing service which generally us quoted or other observable input for the determination of fair value the pricing service normally derives the security price through recently reported trade for identical or similar security and if necessary make adjustment through the reporting date based upon available observable market information for security not actively traded the pricing service may use quoted market price of comparable instrument or discounted cash flow analysis incorporating input currently observable in the market for similar security input often used in the valuation methodology include but are not limited to benchmark yield credit spread default rate prepayment speed and nonbinding broker quote the company is responsible for the determination of fair value it performs quarterly analysis on the price received from the pricing service to determine whether the price are reasonable estimate of fair value specifically the company compare the price received from the pricing service to price reported by secondary pricing source such it custodian it investment consultant and third party investment advisor additionally the company compare change in the reported market value and return to relevant market index to test the reasonableness of the reported price the company internal price verification procedure and review of fair value methodology documentation provided by independent pricing service have not historically resulted in adjustment to the price obtained from
