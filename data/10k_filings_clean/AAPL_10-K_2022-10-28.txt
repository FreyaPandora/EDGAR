partner primarily located in asia for final assembly of substantially all of the company hardware product any failure of these partner to perform can have negative impact on the company cost or supply of component or finished good in addition manufacturing or logistics in these location or transit to final destination can be disrupted for variety of reason including natural and man made disaster information technology system failure commercial dispute armed conflict economic business labor environmental public health or political issue or international trade dispute the company ha invested in manufacturing process equipment much of which is held at certain of it outsourcing partner and ha made prepayment to certain of it supplier associated with long term supply agreement while these arrangement help ensure the supply of component and finished good if these outsourcing partner or supplier experience severe financial problem or other disruption in their business such continued

including if supplier decide to concentrate on the production of common component instead of component customized to meet the company requirement when the company supply of component for new or existing product ha been delayed or constrained or when an outsourcing partner ha delayed shipment of completed product to the company the company business result of operation and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delay or constraint could materially adversely affect the company business result of operation and financial condition the company business and financial

horizon of the company risk management activity and the anticipatory nature of the exposure there can be no assurance these position will offset more than portion of the financial impact resulting from movement in either foreign exchange or interest rate further the recognition of the gain and loss related to these instrument may not coincide with the timing of gain and loss related to the underlying economic exposure and therefore may adversely affect the company financial condition and operating result interest rate riskthe company exposure to change in interest rate relates primarily to the company investment portfolio and outstanding debt while the company is exposed to global interest rate fluctuation it is most affected by fluctuation in interest rate change in interest rate affect the interest earned on the company cash cash equivalent and marketable security and the fair value of those security well cost associated with hedging and interest paid on the company debt the company investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the company liquidity requirement the company us combination of internal and external management to execute it investment strategy and achieve it investment objective the company typically invests in highly rated security with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss the company investment policy generally requires security to be investment grade and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer to provide meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company investment portfolio the company performed sensitivity analysis to determine the impact change in interest rate would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming basis point parallel shift in the yield curve based on investment position of september and september hypothetical basis point increase in interest rate across all maturity would result in billion and billion incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio respectively such loss would only be realized if the company sold the investment prior to maturity of september the company had outstanding fixed rate note and of september the company had outstanding floating and fixed rate note with varying maturity for an aggregate carrying amount of billion and billion respectively the company ha entered and in the future may enter into interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk on it outstanding term debt interest rate swap allow the company to effectively convert fixed rate payment into floating rate payment or floating rate payment into fixed rate payment gain and loss on term debt are generally offset by the corresponding loss and gain on the related hedging instrument

interval to the company foreign currency derivative position due to adverse movement in rate the var model is not intended to represent actual loss but is used risk estimation and management tool forecasted transaction firm commitment and asset and liability denominated in foreign currency were excluded from the model based on the result of the model the company estimate with confidence maximum one day loss in fair value of billion of september compared to maximum one day loss in fair value of million of september because the company us foreign currency instrument for hedging purpose the loss in fair value incurred on those instrument are generally offset by increase in the fair value of the underlying exposure actual future gain and loss associated with the company investment portfolio debt and derivative position may differ materially from the sensitivity analysis performed of september due to the inherent limitation associated with predicting the timing and amount of
