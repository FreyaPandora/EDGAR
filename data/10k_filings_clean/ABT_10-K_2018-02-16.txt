or remediation at several location in the united state including puerto rico under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act commonly known superfund abbott is also engaged in remediation at several other site some of which are owned by abbott in cooperation with the environmental protection agency or similar agency is not feasible to predict with certainty the final cost related to investigation and remediation activity abbott belief that such cost together with other expenditure to maintain compliance with applicable law and regulation concerning environmental protection not have material adverse effect on abbott financial position cash flow or result of operation employee abbott employed approximately people of december regulation the development manufacture marketing sale promotion and distribution of abbott product are subject to comprehensive government regulation by the food and drug administration and similar international regulatory agency government regulation by various international supranational federal and state agency address among other matter the development and approval to market abbott product well the

sampling distribution quality control post market surveillance record keeping storage and disposal practice in addition abbott clinical laboratory and associated testing service are subject to comprehensive government regulation including registration certification and licensure by federal state and local agency such the center for medicare medicaid service the drug enforcement

regulation pertaining to health care fraud and abuse including state and federal anti kickback anti self referral and false claim law in the united state prescription drug nutrition and medical device manufacturer such abbott are also subject to tax well application product user establishment and other fee governmental agency can also invalidate intellectual property right compliance with these law and regulation is costly and materially affect abbott business among other effect health care regulation substantially increase the time difficulty and cost incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing product abbott expects this regulatory environment will continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance failure to comply can delay the release of new product or result in regulatory and enforcement action the seizure or recall of product the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for product production and sale suspension or revocation of billing privilege and other civil or criminal sanction including fine and penalty similarly compliance with the law and regulation governing clinical laboratory and testing service requires specialized expertise failure to comply with these regulatory requirement can result in sanction including suspension revocation or limitation of

outcome of health care product and their component that are regularly conducted by industry participant government agency and others these study can call into question the utilization safety and efficacy of previously marketed product in some case these study have resulted and may in the future result in the discontinuation of marketing of such product in one or country and may give rise to claim for damage from person believe they have been injured result of their use access to human health care product continues to be subject of investigation and action by governmental agency legislative body and private organization in many country major focus is cost containment effort to reduce health care cost are also made in the private sector notably by health care payors and provider which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measure abbott expects insurer and provider will continue attempt to reduce the cost or utilization of health care product many country control the price of health care product directly or indirectly through reimbursement payment pricing or coverage limitation budgetary pressure on health care payors may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressure on abbott product for the foreseeable future in the united state the federal government regularly evaluates reimbursement for medical device diagnostics supply and other product well the procedure in which these product may be used the government follows diagnosis related group drg payment system for certain institutional service provided under medicare or medicaid and ha implemented prospective payment system pps for service delivered in hospital outpatient nursing home and home health setting drg and pps entitle health care facility to fixed reimbursement based on the diagnosis and or procedure rather actual cost incurred in patient treatment thereby increasing the incentive for the facility to limit or control expenditure for many health care product other payment methodology change have been proposed and implemented from time to time for example medicare implemented competitive bidding system for certain durable medical equipment including diabetes product enteral nutrition product and supply additionally the protecting access to medicare act establishes new payment system for clinical laboratory test which became effective on january in the patient protection and affordable care act amended by the health care and education reconciliation act together the affordable care act imposed an excise tax on abbott and other medical device manufacturer and importer the excise tax wa subsequently suspended from january through december part of the consolidated appropriation act of in january the excise tax wa suspended for an additional two year the affordable care act also includes provision known the physician payment sunshine act which require manufacturer of drug device and medical supply covered under medicare and medicaid to record any transfer of value to physician and teaching hospital and to report this data to the center for medicare medicaid service for subsequent public disclosure similar reporting requirement have also been enacted on the state level domestically and an increasing number of government worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar law requiring transparency of interaction with health care professional failure to report appropriate data may result in civil or criminal fine and or penalty policy change including potential modification or repeal of all or part of the affordable care act or implementation of new health care legislation could result in significant change to the health care system the regulation of data privacy and security and the protection of the confidentiality of certain personal information including patient health information and financial information is increasing for example the european union ha enacted stricter data protection law which will take effect in that contain enhanced financial penalty for noncompliance similarly the department of health and human service ha issued rule governing the use disclosure and security of protected health information and the food and drug administration ha issued further guidance concerning cybersecurity for medical device in addition certain country have issued or are considering data localization law which limit company ability to transfer protected data across country border failure to comply with data privacy and security law and regulation can result in enforcement action which could include civil or criminal penalty transferring and managing protected information will become more challenging law and regulation are enacted or amended and abbott expects there will be increasing complexity in this area governmental cost containment effort also affect abbott nutritional product business in the united state for example under regulation governing the federally funded special supplemental nutrition program for woman infant and child all state must have cost containment program for infant formula result through competitive bidding state obtain rebate from manufacturer of infant formula whose product are used in the program abbott expects debate to continue at all government level worldwide over the marketing manufacture availability method of delivery and payment for health care product and service well data privacy and security abbott belief that future legislation and regulation in the market it serf could affect access to health care product and service increase rebate reduce price or reimbursement or the rate of price increase for health care product and service change health care delivery system create new fee and obligation for the pharmaceutical nutrition diagnostic and medical device industry or require additional reporting and disclosure it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in

excessive cost to manufacture failure to establish or maintain intellectual property right or infringement of the intellectual property right of others even if abbott successfully develops new product or enhancement or new generation of abbott existing product they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preference changing industry standard or competitor innovation innovation may not

suffer new product and technological advance by abbott competitor may negatively affect abbott result of operation abbott product face intense competition from it competitor product competitor product may be safer more effective more effectively marketed or sold or have lower price or superior performance feature than abbott product abbott can not predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitor product the manufacture of many of abbott product is highly exacting and complex process and if abbott or one of it supplier encounter problem manufacturing product abbott business could suffer the manufacture of many of abbott product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem may arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material natural disaster and environmental factor in addition single supplier are currently used for certain product and material if problem arise during the production of lot or batch of product those product may have to be discarded this could among other thing lead to increased cost lost revenue damage to customer relation time and expense spent investigating the cause and depending on the cause similar loss with respect to other lot batch or product if problem are not discovered before the product is released to the market recall and product liability cost may also be incurred to the extent abbott or one of it supplier experience significant manufacturing problem this could have material adverse effect on abbott revenue and profitability significant safety concern could arise for abbott product which could have material adverse effect on abbott revenue and financial condition health care product typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trial of limited duration following regulatory approval these product will be used over longer period of time in many patient investigator may also conduct additional and perhaps more extensive study if new safety issue are reported abbott may be required to amend the condition of use for product for example abbott may be required to provide additional warning on product label or narrow it approved intended use either of which could reduce the product market acceptance if serious safety issue arise with an abbott product sale of the product could be halted by abbott or by regulatory authority safety issue affecting supplier or competitor product also may reduce the market acceptance of abbott product in addition in the ordinary course of business abbott is the subject of product liability claim and lawsuit alleging that it product or the product of other company that abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patient product liability claim and lawsuit safety alert or product recall and other allegation

customer consequence may also include additional cost decrease in market share for the product lower income or exposure to other claim product liability loss are self insured product liability claim could have material adverse effect on abbott profitability and financial condition fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate may adversely affect our financial statement and abbott ability to realize projected sale and earnings although abbott financial statement are denominated in dollar significant portion of abbott revenue and cost are realized in other currency sale outside of the

revenue were subject to various form of rebate and allowance that abbott recorded reduction of revenue at the time of sale most of these rebate and allowance in are in the nutritional product and diabetes care segment abbott provides rebate to state agency that administer the special supplemental nutrition program for woman infant and child wic wholesaler group purchasing organization and other government agency and private entity rebate amount are usually based upon the volume of purchase using contractual or statutory price for product factor used in the rebate calculation include the identification of which product have been sold subject to rebate which customer or government agency price term apply and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of rebate using historical trend adjusted for current change abbott estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability reduction of gross sale when abbott record it sale of the product settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to six month after sale abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trend and make adjustment to reserve for change in trend and term of rebate program rebate and chargebacks charged against gross sale in and amounted to approximately billion billion and billion respectively or percent percent and percent of gross sale respectively based on gross sale of approximately billion billion and billion respectively subject to rebate one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebate to related gross sale would decrease net sale by approximately million in abbott considers one percentage point increase to be reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebate to related gross sale other allowance charged against gross sale were approximately million million and million for cash discount in and respectively and million million and million for return in and respectively cash discount are known within to day of sale and therefore can be reliably estimated return can be reliably estimated because abbott historical return are low and because sale return term and other sale term have remained relatively unchanged for several period management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balance each quarter in the domestic nutritional business management us both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel management ha access to several large customer inventory management data and for other customer utilizes data from third party that measure time on the retail shelf these source allow management to make reliable estimate of inventory in the distribution channel except for transition period before or after change in the supplier for the wic business in state inventory in the distribution channel doe not vary substantially management also estimate the state processing lag time based on claim data in the wic business the state where the sale is made which is the determining factor for the applicable price is reliably determinable estimate are required for the amount of wic sale within each state where abbott ha the wic business external data source utilized for that estimate are participant data from the department of agriculture usda which administers the wic program participant data from some of the state and internally administered market research the usda ha been making it data available for many year internal data includes historical redemption rate and pricing data at december abbott wic business in state historically adjustment to prior year rebate accrual have not been material to net income abbott employ various technique to verify the accuracy of claim submitted to it and where possible work with the organization submitting claim to gain insight into change that might affect the rebate amount for government agency program the calculation of rebate involves interpretation of relevant regulation which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation income tax abbott operates in numerous country where it income tax return are subject to audit and adjustment because abbott operates globally the nature of the audit item is often complex and the objective of the government auditor can result in tax on the same income in more than one country abbott employ internal and external tax professional to minimize audit adjustment amount where possible in accordance with the accounting rule relating to the measurement of tax contingency in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit application of these rule requires significant amount of judgment in the abbott federal income tax return through are settled except for the federal income tax return of the former alere consolidated group which are settled through no additional income tax have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the tax cut and job act or any additional outside basis difference that exist these amount continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operation pension and post employment benefit abbott offer pension benefit and post employment health care to many of it employee abbott engages outside actuary to assist in the determination of the obligation and cost under these program abbott must develop long term assumption the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate discount rate and the expected return on plan asset the discount rate used to measure liability were determined based on high quality fixed income security that match the duration of the expected retiree benefit the health care cost trend rate represent abbott expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefit and are forward projection of health care cost of the measurement date difference between the assumed rate and the actual rate which will not be known for year can be significant in relation to the obligation and the annual cost recorded for these program low interest rate have significantly increased actuarial loss for these plan at december pretax net actuarial loss and prior service cost and credit recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott defined benefit plan and medical and dental plan were loss of billion and million respectively actuarial loss and gain are amortized over the remaining service attribution period of the employee under the corridor method in accordance with the rule for accounting for post employment benefit difference between the expected long term return on plan asset and the actual annual return are amortized over five year period note to the consolidated financial statement describes the impact of one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate however there can be no certainty that change would be limited to only one percentage point valuation of intangible asset abbott ha acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible asset that abbott record at fair value at the acquisition date transaction involving the purchase or sale of intangible asset occur with some frequency between company in the health care field and valuation are usually based on discounted cash flow analysis the discounted cash flow model requires assumption about the timing and amount of future net cash flow risk cost of capital terminal value and market participant each of these factor can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset abbott engages independent valuation expert who review abbott critical assumption and calculation for acquisition of significant intangible abbott review definite lived intangible asset for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flow approach if the undiscounted cash flow of an intangible asset are le than the carrying value of an intangible asset the intangible asset is written down to it fair value which is usually the discounted cash flow amount where cash flow can not be identified for an individual asset the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flow are identifiable goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset which relate to in process research and development acquired in business combination are reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in impairment occurs at december goodwill amounted to billion and intangible amounted to billion amortization expense in continuing operation for intangible asset amounted to billion in million in and million in there wa no significant reduction of goodwill relating to impairment in and litigation abbott account for litigation loss in accordance with fasb accounting standard codification no contingency under asc no loss contingency provision are recorded for probable loss at management best estimate of loss or when best estimate can not be made minimum loss contingency amount is recorded these estimate are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and the estimate are refined each accounting period additional information becomes known accordingly abbott is often initially unable to develop best estimate of loss and therefore the minimum amount which could be zero is recorded information becomes known either the minimum loss amount is increased resulting in additional loss provision or best estimate can be made also resulting in additional loss provision occasionally best estimate amount is changed to lower amount when event result in an expectation of more favorable outcome than previously expected abbott estimate the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million for it legal proceeding and environmental exposure accrual of approximately million have been recorded at december for these proceeding and exposure these accrual represent management best estimate of probable loss defined by fasb asc no contingency result of operation sale

established pharmaceutical doe not actively pursue primary research development usually begin with work on existing product or after the acquisition of an advanced stage licensing opportunity depending upon the product the phase of development may include drug product development phase bioequivalence study to compare future established pharmaceutical brand with an already marketed compound with the same active pharmaceutical ingredient api phase ii study to test the efficacy of benefit in small group of patient phase iii study to broaden the testing to wider population that reflects the actual medical use phase iv and other post marketing study to obtain new clinical use data on existing product within approved indication the specific requirement scope of clinical trial for obtaining regulatory approval vary across different country and geographic region the process may range from one year for bioequivalence study project to or more year for complex formulation new indication or geographic expansion in specific country such china in the diagnostics segment the phase of the research and development process include discovery which focus on identification of product that will address specific therapeutic area platform or unmet clinical need concept feasibility during which the material and manufacturing process are evaluated testing may include product characterization and analysis is performed to confirm clinical utility development during which extensive testing is performed to demonstrate that the product meet specified design requirement and that the design specification conform to user need and intended us the regulatory requirement for diagnostic product vary across different country and geographic region in the the fda classifies diagnostic product into class ii or iii and the classification determines the regulatory process for approval while the diagnostics segment ha product in all three class the vast majority of it product are categorized class or class ii submission of separate regulatory filing is not required for class product class ii device typically require pre market notification to the fda through regulatory filing known submission most class iii product are subject to the fda pre marketing approval pma requirement other class iii product such those used to screen blood require the submission and approval of

it ability to apply the ce mark to the product outside the and the eu the regulatory requirement vary across different country and region after approval and commercial launch of some cardiovascular and neuromodulation product post market trial may be conducted either due to conditional requirement of the regulatory market approval or with the objective of proving product superiority in the second quarter of the eu adopted the new medical device regulation mdr and the in vitro diagnostic regulation ivdr which replace the existing directive in the eu for medical device and in vitro diagnostic product the mdr and ivdr will apply after three year and five year transition period respectively and will impose additional regulatory requirement on manufacturer of such product in the nutritional segment the research and development process generally focus on identifying and developing ingredient and product that address the nutritional need of particular population infant and
