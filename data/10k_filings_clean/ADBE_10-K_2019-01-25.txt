or third party service provider including our online store at adobe com creative cloud document cloud and experience cloud solution we do not have redundancy for all of our system many of our critical application reside in only one of our data center and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventuality if our business relationship with third party provider of hosting or content delivery service is negatively affected or if one of our content delivery supplier were to terminate it agreement with without adequate notice we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offering to our customer which could subject to reputational harm costly and time intensive notification requirement and cause to lose customer and future business occasionally we migrate data among

subject to global privacy and data security law regulation and code of conduct that apply to our various business unit these law and regulation may be inconsistent across jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and differing sometimes conflicting interpretation government regulator privacy advocate and class action attorney are of contentsincreasingly scrutinizing how company collect process use store share and transmit personal data this increased scrutiny may result in new interpretation of existing law thereby further impacting adobe business globally new and emerging law such the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe state law in the on privacy data and related technology such the california consumer privacy act well industry self regulatory code create new compliance obligation and expand the scope of potential liability either jointly or severally with our customer and supplier while we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirement these new

behalf of our business customer and if our customer fail to comply with contractual obligation or applicable law it could result in litigation or reputational harm to transferring personal information across international border is becoming increasingly complex for example european data transfer outside the european economic area are highly regulated the mechanism that we and many other company rely upon for european data transfer privacy shield and model clause are being contested in the european court system we are closely monitoring development related to requirement for transferring personal data outside the eu and other country that have similar trans border data flow requirement these requirement may result in an increase in the obligation required to provide our service in the eu or in sanction and fine for non compliance several other country including australia and japan have also established specific legal requirement for cross border transfer of personal information other country such india are considering requirement for data localization where personal data must remain in the country if the mechanism for transferring personal information from certain country or area including europe to the united state should be found invalid or if other country implement more restrictive regulation for cross border data transfer or not permit data to leave the country of origin such development could harm our business financial condition and result of operation security vulnerability in our product and system could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claim maintaining the security of our product computer and network is critical issue for and our customer security researcher criminal hacker and other third party regularly develop new technique to penetrate computer and network security measure and we have previously disclosed certain party have in the past managed to breach and misuse some of our system and software in order to access our end

specifically designed to attack our product system computer or network sophisticated hardware and operating system application that we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture including bug vulnerability and other problem that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair customer ability to operate or use our product the cost to prevent eliminate notify affected party of or alleviate cyber or other security problem bug virus worm malicious software program and security vulnerability are significant and our effort to address these problem may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer it is impossible to predict the extent frequency or impact these problem may have on outside party have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employee or user of our product or service to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactic unauthorized party may also attempt to gain physical access to our facility in order to infiltrate our information system or attempt to gain

of this information this may result in litigation and liability or fine our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirement governmental inquiry or oversight or loss of customer confidence any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customer and thereby requiring time

information these problem affect our product and service in particular because cyber attacker tend to focus their effort on popular offering with large user base and we expect them to continue to do so critical vulnerability may be identified in some of our of contentsapplications and service and those of our third party service provider these vulnerability could cause such application and service to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system which could result in liability to or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our product and service to customer we devote significant resource to address security vulnerability through engineering more secure product enhancing security and reliability feature in our product and system code hardening conducting rigorous penetration test deploying update to address security vulnerability reviewing our service provider security control and improving our incident response time but these security vulnerability can not be totally eliminated the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin and we may be unable to implement these measure quickly enough to prevent cyber attacker from gaining unauthorized access into our system and product despite our preventative effort actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and system may harm our reputation or lead to claim against and have in the past led to such claim and could lead some customer to stop using certain product or service to reduce or delay future purchase of product or service or to use competing

reputation some of our enterprise offering have extended and complex sale cycle which can make our sale cycle unpredictable sale cycle for some of our enterprise offering including our adobe experience cloud solution and etlas in our digital medium business are multi phased and complex the complexity in these sale cycle is due to several factor including the need for our sale representative to educate customer about the use and benefit of large scale deployment of our product and service including technical capability security feature potential cost saving and return on investment the desire of organization to undertake significant evaluation process to determine their technology requirement prior to making information technology expenditure the need for our

assurance that potential customer will ultimately purchase our solution we target our sale effort at larger enterprise customer these trend are expected to continue and could have greater impact on our result of operation additionally our enterprise sale pattern ha historically been uneven where higher percentage of quarter total sale occur during the final week of each quarter which is common in our industry our extended sale cycle for these product and service make it difficult to predict when given sale cycle will close subscription offering could create risk related to the timing of revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue from subscription offering ratably over the term of their subscription agreement which range from to month result most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreement entered into during previous quarter any reduction in new or renewed subscription in quarter may not be reflected in our revenue result until later quarter decline in new or renewed subscription may decrease our revenue in future quarter lower sale reduced demand for our product and service and increase in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our result of operation until future period our subscription model could also make it difficult for to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription based or hosted service through additional sale in any period revenue from new customer will be recognized over the applicable subscription term of contentsadditionally in connection with our sale effort to enterprise customer and our use of etlas number of factor could affect our revenue including longer than expected sale and implementation cycle potential deferral of revenue due to multiple element revenue arrangement and alternative licensing arrangement if any of our assumption about revenue from our subscription based offering prove incorrect our actual result may vary materially from those anticipated if our customer fail to renew subscription in accordance with our expectation our future revenue and operating result could suffer our adobe experience cloud creative cloud and document cloud offering typically involve subscription based offering pursuant to product and service agreement revenue from our subscription customer is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreement which typically range from to month our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and customer may not renew their subscription at the same or higher level of service for the same number of seat or for the same duration of time if at all moreover under certain circumstance some of our customer have the right to cancel their agreement prior to the expiration of the term our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription based agreement complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rate therefore we can not provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rate our customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including their level of satisfaction with our service our ability to continue enhancing feature and functionality the reliability including uptime of our subscription offering the price of offering and those offered by our competitor the actual or perceived information security of our system and service decrease in the size of our customer base

critical accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rule and regulation of the sec we make assumption judgment and estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our assumption judgment and estimate on historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition on regular basis we evaluate our assumption judgment and estimate we also discus our critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of the board of director we believe that the assumption judgment and estimate involved in the accounting for business combination and income tax have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement these area are key component of our result of operation and are based on complex rule requiring to make judgment and estimate so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy historically our assumption judgment and estimate relative to our critical accounting policy have not differed materially from actual result business combinationswe allocate the purchase price of acquired company to the tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimate and assumption with respect to intangible asset and deferred revenue obligation although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market condition and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale subscription support agreement consulting contract and acquired developed technology and patent

price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligation assumed the estimated fair value of these obligation is determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin unanticipated event and circumstance may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result accounting for income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumption judgment and estimate to determine our current provision for income tax and also our deferred tax asset and liability our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax law our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcome of current and future audit conducted by foreign and domestic tax authority we have established reserve for income tax to address potential exposure involving tax position that could be challenged by tax authority in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service irs and other domestic and foreign tax authority we expect future examination to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practice well other matter we regularly ass the likelihood of outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax and have reserved for potential adjustment that may result from such examination we believe such estimate to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examination could significantly impact the amount provided for income tax in our consolidated financial statement recent accounting

to one or more reporting segment on the date of acquisition we review our goodwill for impairment annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year and between annual test if an event occurs or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of any one of our reporting unit below it respective carrying amount in performing our goodwill impairment test we first perform qualitative assessment which requires that we consider event or circumstance including macroeconomic condition industry and market consideration cost factor overall financial performance change in management or key personnel change in strategy change in customer change in the composition or carrying amount of reporting segment net asset and change in our stock price if after assessing the totality of event or circumstance we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting segment are greater than the carrying amount then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should be performed we then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segment to it carrying value including the associated goodwill to determine the fair value we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flow our cash flow assumption consider historical and forecasted revenue operating cost and other relevant factor we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal we determined after performing qualitative review of each reporting segment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segment substantially exceeds the respective carrying amount accordingly there wa no indication of impairment and the quantitative goodwill impairment test wa not performed we did not identify any event or change in circumstance since the performance of our annual goodwill impairment test that would require to perform another goodwill impairment test during the fiscal year we amortize intangible asset with finite life over their estimated useful life and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists we continually monitor event and change in circumstance that could indicate carrying amount of our long lived asset including our intangible asset may not be recoverable when such event or change in circumstance occur we ass recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such asset will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flow if the future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying amount of these asset we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charge in fiscal or during fiscal our intangible asset were amortized over their estimated useful life ranging from to year amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the

criterion for revenue recognition ha been met recently adopted accounting guidance on january the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu simplifying the test

reportable segment exceeds it fair value during the qualitative assessment one step goodwill impairment test will be performed if it is concluded during the quantitative test that the carrying amount of reportable segment exceeds it fair value an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reportable segment the effective date of the new standard for public company is for fiscal year beginning after december and interim period within those fiscal year early adoption is permitted in the first quarter of we early adopted asu the standard did not have an impact to our qualitative assessment for goodwill impairment that we performed in the second quarter of fiscal there have been no other new accounting pronouncement made effective during fiscal that have significance or potential significance to our consolidated financial statement recent accounting pronouncement not yet effectiveon may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised good or service to customer the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective and permit the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method the updated standard is effective for in the first quarter of fiscal we will adopt this updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal on modified retrospective basis we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure while we are continuing to ass all potential impact of the new standard we believe there should not be material change to the amount of consolidated revenue on an annual basis we expect revenue related to our cloud offering including creative cloud and document cloud for business enterprise individual and team to remain substantially unchanged when sold with cloud enabled service creative cloud and document cloud require significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual component are not considered distinct revenue for these offering will continue to be recognized over the period in which the cloud service are provided we believe the most significant revenue related impact relates to our accounting for arrangement that include on premise term based software license bundled with maintenance and support under current gaap the revenue attributable to these software license is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because vsoe doe not exist for the undelivered of contentsadobe inc note to consolidated

software license is eliminated under the new standard accordingly under the new standard we will be required to recognize revenue portion of the arrangement fee upon delivery of the software license and potentially classify such revenue product instead of subscription revenue on the income statement we offer on premise term based software license bundled with maintenance and support deployment model for certain offering within our digital experience digital medium and publishing business unit we do not expect these arrangement to have material impact to revenue reported in annual reporting period subsequent to adoption however they may result in material balance sheet impact on the date of adoption due to the application of the modified retrospective transition method the modified retrospective method requires upon adoption that we recognize the impact of applying the new standard to contract that are not completed at the date of initial adoption but under this adoption method we do not restate prior financial statement we will record cumulative effect of initially applying the provision of the new standard an adjustment to increase the opening retained earnings balance and reduce the opening deferred revenue balance further some of our enterprise agreement allow our customer to commit to prepaid bank of fund which can be utilized to purchase adobe product or service which includes customer option to purchase or renew on premise term based license on monthly basis revenue associated with these term license performance obligation would be recognized monthly other expected impact to our policy and disclosure include earlier recognition of revenue for certain contract due to the elimination of contingent revenue limitation an unbilled receivable balance on our balance sheet the requirement to estimate variable consideration for certain arrangement increased allocation of revenue to and from professional service and other offering and change to our financial statement disclosure such remaining performance obligation under current gaap we expense cost related to the acquisition of revenue generating contract incurred under the new standard we will be required to capitalize certain cost incremental to contract acquisition and amortize them over the expected period of benefit we expect there will be material balance sheet impact at the period of adoption to capitalize cost of obtaining the contract an asset with corresponding adjustment to opening retained earnings at the date of initial adoption additionally we may have to record related deferred income tax we continue to evaluate the magnitude of the impact and the impact recent acquisition will have under current standard and the new standard due to the complexity of certain of our contract the actual accounting treatment required under the new standard for these arrangement may be dependent on contract specific term and therefore may vary in some instance on february the fasb

december and interim period within those fiscal year early adoption is permitted the updated standard is effective for beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and we do not plan to early adopt the new lease standard must be adopted using modified retrospective transition and allows for the application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented or at the adoption date in july the fasb issued asu no lease targeted improvement providing an optional transition method that allows entity to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption we intend to adopt the new lease standard using this optional transition method while we are continuing to ass the potential impact of the standard we currently expect the most significant impact will be the recognition of right of use asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance

requiring expanded hedge accounting for both non financial and financial risk component and refining the measurement of hedge result to better reflect an entity hedging strategy for example adoption
