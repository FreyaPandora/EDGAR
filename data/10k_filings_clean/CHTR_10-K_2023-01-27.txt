fiber based construction is dependent on variety of external factor including the make ready and utility pole permitting process with fewer home and business in these area broadband provider need to access multiple pole per home opposed to multiple home per pole in higher density setting result pole application pole replacement rule and their affiliated issue resolution process are all factor that can have significant impact on construction timing and speed to completion the rdof auction rule and other subsidy grant establish construction milestone for the build out utilizing subsidized

national competitor advertising competition ha increased and will likely continue to increase new advertising platform seek to attract the same advertiser we compete for advertising revenue against among others local broadcast station national cable and broadcast network radio station print medium and online advertising company and content provider seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation service area our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising our capital expenditure and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth network program specific project and construction regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our service for both residential and commercial customer cable system and related communication network and service are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do in the future we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new law regulation or regulatory action that do not equally impact our key competitor for example internet delivered streaming video service compete with our traditional video service but they are not subject to the same level of federal state and local regulation we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future in addition through may we are subject to charter specific condition regarding certain business practice result of the fcc approval of the merger in with time warner cable inc twc and acquisition of bright house network llc bright house video servicemust carry retransmission consentthere are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession popular station routinely invoke retransmission consent and demand substantial compensation increase in their negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost pole attachmentsthe communication act of amended the communication act requires many investor owned utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and also subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation the federally regulated rate now applicable to pole attachment used for cable or telecommunication service including when offered together with internet service are substantially similar the fcc approach doe not directly affect the rate in state that self regulate but many of those state have substantially the same rate for all communication attachment we sometimes face challenge getting access to pole in rural area when the fcc pole attachment rule do not apply other fcc regulatory mattersthe communication act and fcc regulation cover variety of additional area applicable to our video service including among other thing licensing of system and facility including the grant of various spectrum license equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming ownership restriction posting of certain information on an fcc public file website including but not limited to political advertising record equal employment opportunity practice compliance with child programming requirement policy for commercial leased access system information and channel carriage information including disclosure of our ownership interest in channel we carry emergency alert system inside wiring and contract for mdu complex accessibility of content including requirement governing video description and closed captioning competitive availability of cable equipment the provision of up to of video channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party and public education and government entity access requirement each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation the fcc regulates spectrum usage in way that could impact our operation including for microwave backhaul broadcast unlicensed wifi and cbr our ability to access and use spectrum that may become available in the future is uncertain and may be limited by further fcc auction or allocation decision new spectrum obtained by other party could also lead to additional wireless competition to our existing and future service it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system or the service delivered over cable system and competing service in the future and we can not predict at this time that might impact our business copyrightthe carriage of television and radio broadcast signal by cable system are subject to federal compulsory copyright license the copyright law provides copyright owner the right to audit our payment under the compulsory license and the copyright office is currently considering modification to the license royalty calculation and reporting obligation the possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming franchise mattersour cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise permit and similar authorization granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way cable franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction they generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard supporting and carrying public education and government access channel and change in the ownership of the franchisee although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law imposes cap on franchise fee of of gross revenue from the provision of cable service over the cable system in the fcc that the value of in kind contribution requirement set forth in cable franchise is subject to the statutory cap on franchise fee and it reaffirmed that state and local authority are barred from imposing franchise fee on revenue derived from non cable service such internet service provided by cable operator over cable system those rule were generally upheld by federal court in number of state have adopted franchising law that provide for state issued franchising generally state issued cable franchise are for fixed term or in perpetuity streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirement and eliminate local negotiation and enforcement of term the communication act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authority may not unreasonably deny renewal if we fail to obtain renewal of franchise representing significant number of our customer it could have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or our liquidity similarly if franchising authority consent is required for the purchase or sale of cable system the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent internet servicethe fcc originally classified broadband internet access service such those we offer an information service which exempted the service from traditional communication common carrier law and regulation in the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service telecommunication service and on that basis imposed number of net neutrality rule governing the provision of broadband service in the fcc reversed it decision and eliminated the rule other than transparency requirement which obligates to disclose performance statistic and other service information to consumer it is possible that the fcc might again revise it approach to broadband internet access or that congress might enact legislation affecting the rule applicable to the service the application of new legal requirement to our internet service could adversely affect our business the fcc recently adopted new rule to expand the surviving transparency requirement by requiring to post standardized label similar to the format of food nutrition label for each of our currently available consumer internet offering these new rule are scheduled to take effect six month after approval by the federal office of management and budget the fcc decision reclassifying internet access service also ruled that state regulator may not impose obligation similar to federal network neutrality obligation that the fcc eliminated but this blanket prohibition wa vacated by the court of appeal in the court left open the possibility that individual state law could be deemed preempted on case by case basis if it is shown that they conflict with federal law several state have adopted rule similar to the network neutrality requirement that were eliminated by the fcc and the california rule were upheld in federal court california ha also adopted other regulation on internet service including network resiliency rule to assure backup power is available after natural disaster and other outage and it ha an open proceeding to consider the imposition of service quality metric on internet service provider new york adopted legislation that would have required internet service provider to offer discounted internet service to qualifying low income consumer but federal district judge enjoined enforcement likely to be deemed rate regulation of internet service that would be preempted by federal law that decision is currently appealed we can not predict other legislation and regulation may be adopted by state or how challenge to such requirement will be resolved in recent year the federal state and local government have offered billion of dollar in subsidy to company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved using fund from the fcc rdof auction in the american rescue plan act of arpa and the infrastructure investment and job act of the iija we support such subsidy provided they are not directed to area that are already served and have sought and expect to continue to seek subsidy for our own broadband construction in unserved and underserved area through program including rdof and those created pursuant to arpa and if regulatory requirement are reasonable the iija we have been awarded over billion in the rdof auction and other federal state and municipal grant that will partially fund along with our substantial additional investment the construction of new broadband infrastructure to more than one million estimated passing our award through rdof and arpa include number of regulatory requirement such serving the carrier of last resort and completing increasingly larger portion of the network construction by certain date if we fail to meet these obligation we could be subject to substantial government penalty the market for our internet service is affected by participation in and the general availability of program that offer federal subsidy for certain low income consumer for the purchase of internet access service in pursuant to congressional for covid relief the fcc established temporary monthly emergency broadband benefit program ebbp subsidy of up to for most eligible low income household with the funding for ebbp set to run out congress in the iija authorized billion for the successor acp that provides up to monthly discount for most eligible customer paid to the household broadband provider we elected to participate in the ebbp and acp and the fcc regulates many of the term on which we provide acp service including restriction on our ability to refuse service to prospective eligible customer based upon their credit or payment history the acp discount enables eligible household to purchase our spectrum internet assist service at no cost to them and we can not predict whether congress or the fcc will provide additional funding to extend the acp or on what term when acp funding run out which is expected to be at some point in wireline voice servicethe fcc ha never classified the voip wireline telephone service we offer telecommunication service that are subject to traditional federal common carrier regulation but instead ha imposed some of these regulatory requirement on case by case basis such requirement relating to emergency service communication assistance for law enforcement act calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information protection number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee back up power robocall mitigation and discontinuance of service it is possible that the fcc or congress will impose additional federal requirement on our voip telephone service in the future our voip telephone service are subject to certain state and local regulatory fee such fee and contribution to state universal service fund additionally to comply with rdof program requirement we have chosen in the rdof area to offer lifeline voip telephone service subject to traditional federal and state common carrier regulation except where we have chosen to offer voip telephone service in such manner we believe that our voip telephone service should be governed primarily by federal regulation federal appellate court affirmed our successful challenge to minnesota attempt to generally apply telephone regulation to our voip service but that ruling is limited to the seven state in the circuit some state have attempted to subject cable voip service such our voip telephone service to state level regulation california ha imposed reporting and other obligation on our voip service including backup power requirement and ha proposed the imposition of service quality metric on voip service we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure the continuity of our service however it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved state regulatory commission and legislature may continue to consider imposing regulatory requirement on our fixed telephone service mobile service our spectrum mobile service offer mobile internet access and telephone service we provide this service an mvno using verizon network and our network through spectrum wifi an mvno we are subject to many of the same fcc regulation that apply to facility based wireless carrier well certain state or local regulation including but not limited to local number portability customer privacy calea universal service fund contribution robocall mitigation and hearing aid compatibility and safety and emission requirement for mobile device spectrum mobile broadband internet access service is also subject to the fcc transparency rule the fcc or other regulatory authority may adopt new or different regulation for mvnos and or mobile service provider in the future or impose new tax or fee applicable to spectrum mobile which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally for example california ha proposed the imposition of service quality metric on mobile service privacy and information security regulationthe communication act limit our ability to collect use and disclose customer personally identifiable information for our internet video and voice service we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer information all broadband provider are also obliged by calea to configure their network in manner that facilitates the ability of state and federal law enforcement with proper legal process authorized under the electronic communication privacy act to obtain record and information concerning our customer including the content of their communication further the fcc federal trade commission ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of communication service provider including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial email the ftc currently ha the authority pursuant to it general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive act and practice to protect the privacy of internet service customer including our use and disclosure of certain customer information operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation various security standard provide guidance to telecommunication company in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk one such standard is the voluntary framework released by the national institute for standard and technology nist in and updated in in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure the nist cybersecurity framework provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business it wa designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc and department of homeland security cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa we voluntarily follow nist part of our overall cybersecurity program the fcc is considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement cisa is also developing cyber incident reporting rule pursuant to legislative requirement that require critical infrastructure entity to report substantial cyber incident within hour of their discovery many state and local authority have considered legislative or other action that would impose restriction on our ability to collect use and disclose and safeguard certain consumer information particularly with regard to our broadband internet business for example the california consumer privacy act ccpa and maine act to protect privacy of online customer information both became effective in the ccpa under certain circumstance regulates company use and disclosure of the personal information of california resident and authorizes enforcement action by the california attorney general and private class action for data breach in addition effective january the california consumer privacy right act cpra amended ccpa to impose additional obligation on company that handle the personal information of california resident the maine law regulates how internet service provider use and disclose customer personal information and requires internet service provider to take reasonable measure to protect customer personal information virginia new privacy law became effective on january and colorado and connecticut new privacy law will become effective later in each of these law will regulate the way that company collect use and share personal information about consumer several other state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business the ftc ha launched an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anpr to explore rule related to the collection analysis and monetization of consumer information congress may also adopt new privacy and data security obligation we can not predict whether any of these effort will be successful or preempted or how new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business remaining commitment related to the merger with twc and acquisition of bright housein connection with approval of the merger with twc and acquisition of bright house the transaction federal and state regulator imposed number of post transaction condition on many of which have been fulfilled or have terminated remaining federal commitment will expire in and include the

networking mentorship and skill building opportunity risk factor risk related to our businesswe operate in competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden access to better financing and greater and more favorable brand name recognition increasing consolidation in the telecommunication and content industry have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale including the ability to launch new video service our internet service face competition from other company ftth fixed wireless broadband internet delivered via satellite and dsl service various operator offer wireless internet service delivered over network which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speed and also continue to expand mobile service our voice and mobile service compete with wireless and wireline phone provider well other form of communication such text instant messaging social networking service video conferencing and email competition from these company including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing and exclusive programming may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customer our video service face competition from number of source including db service and company that deliver linear network programming movie and television show on demand and other video content over broadband internet connection to television computer tablet and mobile device often with password sharing among multiple user and security that make content susceptible to piracy newer product and service particularly alternative method for the distribution sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed further increasing the number of competitor that we face the increasing number of choice available to audience including low cost or free choice could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our product and service but also advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television network and station well other advertising platform such online medium radio and print competition related to our service offering to business continues to increase well more company deploy more fiber to more building which may negatively impact our growth and put pressure on margin failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technology and change in customer expectation and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position with respect to the leisure time and discretionary spending of our customer and result affect our business and result of operation competition may also reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including debt service requirement for additional information regarding the competition we face see item business competition and regulation and legislation we depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we depend on limited number of third party service provider supplier and licensors to supply some of the service hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our service and execute our network evolution and rural construction initiative some of our hardware software and operational support vendor and service provider represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or result of intellectual property right position of some exclusivity our ability to provide some service and complete our network evolution and rural construction initiative might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative source of the affected material or service might interrupt or delay our ability to serve existing and new customer if any of these party experience or engage in the following breach or terminate or elect not to renew their agreement with or otherwise fail to perform their obligation in timely manner demand exceeds these vendor capacity tariff are imposed that impact vendor ability to perform their obligation or significantly increase the amount we pay experience operating or financial difficulty significantly increase the amount we are required to pay including demand for substantial non monetary compensation for necessary product or service or cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand profitability or change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner at our specification and at reasonable price our third party service provider supplier and licensors have been disrupted by worker absenteeism quarantine restriction on employee ability to work office and factory closure disruption to port and other shipping infrastructure border closure or other travel or health related restriction over the last three year in addition the existence of only limited number of vendor of key technology can lead to le product innovation and higher cost these event could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customer and our operation business financial result and financial condition we may not have the ability to pas on to our customer all of the increase in programming cost which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin programming cost are our single largest expense item our programming cost have historically increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increase while decrease in video customer combined with change in the mix of customer choosing lower cost package have lowered total programming cost increase we expect contractual programming rate per service subscriber to continue to increase result of annual increase pursuant to our programming contract and contract renewal with programmer although we pas along amount paid for local broadcast station retransmission consent to the majority of our customer the inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product additionally the demand of large medium company with additional selling power result of medium and broadcast station group consolidation who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase of their le popular network and require to carry their most popular network to large percentage of our video subscriber have limited our flexibility in selling more tailored and cost sensitive programming package for consumer in order to mitigate impact to our operating margin due to increasing programming rate we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy increase in the cost of sport programming and the amount paid for local broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributor to the growth in our programming cost over the last year federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result our programming contract are generally for fixed period of time with potentially significant spend subject to negotiated renewal in any particular year we will seek to renew these agreement on term that we believe are favorable there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may in the future be forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer any failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customer could adversely impact our customer level operation and financial result any failure to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we operate in highly competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment from time to time we may pursue strategic initiative to launch product or enhancement to our product our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technology to address consumer changing demand and distinguish our service from those of our competitor we may not be able to accurately predict technological trend or the success of new product and service if we choose technology or equipment that are le effective cost efficient or attractive to customer than those chosen by our competitor if technology or equipment on which we have chosen to rely cease to be available to on reasonable term or condition if we offer service that fail to appeal to consumer are not available at competitive price or that do not function expected if we are not able to fund the expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development or if we are no longer able to make our service available to our customer on third device on which substantial number of customer have relied to access our service our competitive position could deteriorate and our business and financial result could suffer the ability of some of our competitor to introduce new technology product and service more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position furthermore advance in technology decrease in the cost of existing technology or change in competitor product and service offering may require in the future to make additional research and development expenditure or to offer at no additional charge or at lower price certain product and service that we currently offer to customer separately or at premium in addition the uncertainty of our ability and the cost to obtain intellectual property right from third party could impact our ability to respond to technological advance in timely and effective manner any failure to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer in addition we continue to grow our mobile service using virtual network operator right from third party we expect continued growth related sale and marketing and other customer acquisition cost well negative working capital impact from the timing of device related cash flow when we provide device pursuant to equipment installation plan we also continue to consider and pursue opportunity in the mobile space which may include the acquisition of additional licensed spectrum and may include entering into or expanding joint venture or partnership with wireless or cable provider which may require significant investment for example we now hold cbr pal to support existing and future mobile service these license are subject to revocation and expiration although we expect to be able to maintain and renew these license the loss of one or more license could significantly impair our ability to offload mobile traffic and achieve cost reduction if we are unable to continue to grow our mobile business and achieve the outcome we expect from our

that could affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow capitalization of labor and overhead cost income tax defined benefit pension planscapitalization of labor and overhead cost cost associated with network construction or upgrade placement of the customer drop to the dwelling and the placement of outlet within dwelling along with the cost associated with the deployment of new customer premise equipment necessary to provide internet video or voice service are capitalized cost capitalized include material direct labor and certain indirect these indirect cost consist of compensation and overhead cost associated with support function while our capitalization is based on specific activity capitalized we track these cost on composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation the cost of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from dwelling and the cost to reconnect customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating expense incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain component betterment and replacement of cable drop and outlet are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalized direct labor and overhead of billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment cost to package and ship new equipment to customer home for self installation verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with the installation replacement and betterment of equipment and material to enable internet video or voice service and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment well testing signal level at the utility pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity iii the cost of support personnel such care personnel and dispatcher who assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity while we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our operating practice could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy
