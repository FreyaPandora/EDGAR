including but not limited to our financial statement and the related note and part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation risk related to our businessesour revenue depend on commercial network deployment expansion and upgrade of cdma ofdma and other communication technology including our customer and licensee sale of product and service based on these technology and customer demand for our product and service we develop patent and commercialize technology and product based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology which are primarily wireless we depend on operator of wireless network and our customer and licensee to adopt and or implement the latest generation of these technology for use in their network device and service we also depend on our customer and licensee to develop device and service based on these technology with value added feature to drive consumer demand for new and multi mode device well and single mode device well to establish the selling price for such device further we depend on the timing of our customer and licensee deployment of new device and service based on these technology increasingly we also depend on operator of wireless network our customer and licensee and other third party to incorporate these technology into new device type and into industry and application beyond traditional cellular communication such automotive iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics networking computing and artificial intelligence ai such machine learning among others we have historically been successful during wireless technology transition the next generation of wireless technology is which we expect will empower new era of connected device and will be utilized not only in handset but in new device type industry and application beyond traditional cellular communication described above see also part item business for further description of we expect initial commercial deployment of device to begin in calendar we believe it is important that we be leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing and develop commercialize and be leading supplier of integrated circuit product and service in order to sustain and grow our business long term our revenue and or growth in revenue could be negatively impacted our business may be harmed and our substantial investment in these technology may not provide an adequate return if wireless operator and industry beyond traditional cellular communication deploy alternative technology wireless operator delay next generation network deployment particularly expansion or upgrade and or delay moving customer to multi mode or wireless device lte an ofdma based wireless technology is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed government regulator delay making sufficient spectrum available for and wireless technology including unlicensed spectrum and shared spectrum technology thereby restricting the ability of wireless operator to deploy or expand the use of these technology wireless operator delay or do not drive improvement in or multi mode network performance and or capacity our customer and licensee revenue and sale of product particularly premium tier product and service using these technology and average selling price asp of such product decline do not grow or do not grow anticipated due to for example the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed region our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the standardization effort is different than in and standard the standardization and or deployment of technology is delayed we are unable to drive the adoption of our product and service into network and device including device beyond traditional cellular application based on cdma ofdma and other communication technology and or consumer rate of replacement of smartphones and other computing device decline do not grow or do not grow quickly anticipated our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and or declining average selling price for our product and or those of our customer and or licensee our product service and technology face significant competition we expect competition to increase our current competitor expand their product offering or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to attract new business and or customer new opportunity develop and new competitor enter the industry competition in wireless communication is affected by various factor that include among others device manufacturer concentration vertical integration growth in demand consumption and competition in certain geographic region government intervention and or support of national industry and or competitor evolving industry standard and business model evolving method of transmission of voice and data communication increasing data traffic and densification of wireless network convergence and aggregation of connectivity technology including wi fi and lte in both device and access point consolidation of wireless technology and infrastructure at the network edge networking and connectivity trend including cloud service use of licensed shared and unlicensed spectrum the evolving nature of computing including demand for always on always connected capability the speed of technological change including the transition to smaller geometry process technology value added feature that drive selling price well consumer demand for new multi mode and device turnkey integrated product that incorporate hardware software user interface application and reference design scalability and the ability of the system technology to meet customer immediate and future network requirement we anticipate that additional competitor will introduce product result of growth opportunity in wireless communication the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitor technological and public policy change and relatively low barrier to entry in certain segment of the industry additionally the semiconductor industry ha experienced and may continue to experience consolidation which could result in significant change to the competitive landscape we expect that our future success will depend on among other factor our ability to differentiate our integrated circuit product with innovative technology across multiple product and feature modem radio frequency front end rffe graphic and or other processor camera and connectivity and with smaller geometry process technology that drive performance develop and offer integrated circuit product at competitive cost and price point to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic region and all device tier drive the adoption of our integrated circuit product into the most popular device model and across broad spectrum of device such smartphones tablet laptop and other computing device automobile wearable and voice and music and other connected device and infrastructure product maintain and or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit product at the premium device tier while increasing the adoption of our product in mid and low tier device in part by strengthening our integrated circuit product roadmap for and developing channel relationship in emerging region such china and india and by providing turnkey product which incorporate our integrated circuit for low and mid tier smartphones tablet and laptop continue to be leader in and technology evolution including expansion of our lte based single mode licensing program in area where single mode product are commercialized and continue to innovate and introduce and turnkey integrated product and service that differentiate from our competition be leader serving original equipment manufacturer high level operating system hlos provider operator cloud provider and other industry participant competitor new industry entrant and other factor continue to affect the industry landscape be preferred partner and sustain preferred relationship providing integrated circuit product that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platform to industry participant that effectively commercialize new device using these platform increase and or accelerate demand for our semiconductor component product including rffe and our wired and wireless connectivity product including networking product for consumer carrier and enterprise equipment and connected device identify potential acquisition target that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic need reach agreement on term acceptable to close the transaction and effectively integrate these new business and or technology create standalone value and or contribute to the success of our existing business through acquisition joint venture and other transaction and or by developing customer licensee vendor distributor and or other channel relationship in new industry segment and or disruptive technology product and or service such product for automotive iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics networking computing and ai such machine learning among others become leading supplier of rffe product which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturer in developing multiband multi mode mobile device be leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing and develop commercialize and be leading supplier of integrated circuit product and service and or continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known company in computing and other consumer driven segment and to deepen our presence in significant emerging region competition in any or all product tier may result in the loss of certain business or customer which would negatively impact our revenue result of operation and cash flow such competition may also reduce average selling price for our chipset product and or the product of our customer and licensee certain of these dynamic are particularly pronounced in emerging region where competitor may have lower cost structure and or may have willingness and ability to accept lower price and or lower or negative margin on their product particularly in china reduction in the average selling price of our chipset product without corresponding increase in volume would negatively impact our revenue and without corresponding decrease in average unit cost would negatively impact our margin in addition reduction in the average selling price of our licensee product unless offset by an increase in volume would generally decrease total royalty payable to negatively impacting our licensing revenue we compete with many different semiconductor company ranging from multinational company with integrated research and development manufacturing sale and marketing organization across broad spectrum of product line to company that are focused on single application market segment or standard product including those that produce product for automotive iot and networking application most of these competitor compete with with respect to some but not all of our business company that promote standard that are neither cdma nor ofdma based gsm well company that design integrated circuit based on cdma ofdma wi fi or their derivative are generally competitor or potential competitor example some of which are strategic partner of ours in other area include advanced micro device inc broadcom limited cirrus logic cypress semiconductor corporation hisilicon technology intel marvell technology maxim integrated product mediatek microchip technology inc murata manufacturing co ltd nordic semiconductor nvidia nxp semiconductor qorvo inc realtek semiconductor renesas electronics corporation samsung electronics sequans communication skyworks solution inc and spreadtrum communication which is controlled by tsinghua unigroup some of these current and potential competitor may have advantage over that include among others motivation by our customer in certain circumstance to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product to use our competitor integrated circuit product and or sell such product to others including by bundling with other product or to choose alternative technology lower cost structure and or willingness and ability to accept lower price and lower or negative margin for their product particularly in china foreign government support of other technology or competitor better known brand name ownership and control of manufacturing facility and greater expertise in manufacturing process more extensive relationship with local distribution company and original equipment manufacturer in certain geographic region such china and or experience in adjacent industry segment outside traditional cellular industry such automotive and iot and or more established presence in certain region derive significant portion of our consolidated revenue from small number of customer and licensee which increasingly includes small number of chinese oems if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected our qct segment derives significant portion of it revenue from small number of customer and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among few company particularly at the premium tier contributing to this trend chinese oems continue to grow their device share in china and are increasing their device share in region outside of china and we derive significant and increasing portion of our revenue from small number of these oems in addition certain of our largest integrated circuit customer develop their own integrated circuit product which they have in the past chosen to utilize in certain of their device and may in the future choose to utilize in certain or all of their device rather than our product and or sell their integrated circuit product to third party in competition with also apple which ha historically been one of our largest customer now utilizes product of one of our competitor in many of their device rather than our product is solely utilizing one or more or our competitor product in it next smartphone launch and may continue to use our competitor product rather than our product in the future the loss of any one of our significant customer reduction in the purchase of our product by such customer or the cancelation of significant purchase by any of these customer whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit product our competitor integrated circuit product or otherwise would reduce our revenue and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected result of operation and delay of significant purchase even if only temporary would reduce our revenue in the period of the delay any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development further the concentration of device share among few company and the corresponding purchasing power of these company may result in lower price for our product which if not accompanied by sufficient increase in the volume of purchase of our product could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margin in addition the timing and size of purchase by our significant customer may be impacted by the timing of such customer new or next generation product introduction over which we have no control and the timing and or success of such introduction may cause our revenue and result of operation to fluctuate accordingly if current industry dynamic and concentration continue our qct segment revenue will continue to depend largely upon and be impacted by future purchase and the timing and size of any such future purchase by these significant customer further apple purchase our mobile data modem mdm product which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contribution than our combined modem and application processor product to the extent apple take device share from our other customer purchase our integrated modem and application processor product our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted further company that develop hlos for device including leading technology company now sell their own device if we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these company or with their partner or customer they may decide not to purchase either directly or through their contract manufacturer or to reduce or discontinue their purchase of our integrated circuit product in addition there ha been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customer and other industry participant and the potential outcome of such litigation including but not limited to injunction against device that incorporate our product and or intellectual property or ruling on certain patent law or patent licensing issue that create new legal precedent could impact our business particularly if such action impact one of our larger customer although we have more than licensee our qtl segment derives significant portion of it revenue from limited number of licensee which increasingly includes small number of chinese oems in the event that one or more of our significant licensee fail to meet their reporting and or payment obligation or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreement including standard essential patent only license agreement under similar term our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be adversely impacted moreover the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensee to develop introduce and deliver high volume product that achieve and sustain customer acceptance we have no control over the product development sale effort or pricing of product by our licensee and our licensee might not be successful reduction in the average selling price of wireless device sold by our licensee without sufficient increase in the volume of such device sold would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue such adverse impact may be muted by the per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet and laptop we derive significant portion of our consolidated revenue from the premium tier device segment if sale of premium tier device decrease and or sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product decrease our result of operation could be negatively affected derive significant portion of our revenue from the premium tier device segment and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowing growth in the premium tier device segment due to among other factor lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where premium tier smartphones are common increasing consumer demand in emerging region particularly china and india where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region and are continuing to lengthen and or maturing premium tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle in addition discussed in the prior risk factor our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among few company at the premium tier which give them significant supply chain leverage further those company may utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product rather than our product in all or portion of their device these dynamic may result in lower price for and or reduced sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product reduction in sale of premium tier device or reduction in sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower tier integrated circuit product may reduce our revenue and margin and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial result any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development effort by some communication equipment manufacturer or their customer to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision and or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business from time to time company initiate various strategy to attempt to renegotiate mitigate and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property these strategy have included litigation often alleging infringement of patent held by such company patent misuse patent exhaustion patent invalidity and or unenforceability of our patent and or license that we do not license our patent on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory frand term or some form of unfair competition or competition law violation ii taking position contrary to our understanding of their contract with iii appeal to governmental authority iv collective action including working with wireless operator standard body other like minded company and other organization on both formal and informal base to adopt intellectual property policy and practice that could have the effect of limiting return on intellectual property innovation lobbying governmental regulator and elected official for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rate or the base on which royalty are calculated of seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing and or of weakening patent holder ability to enforce it right or obtain fair return for such right and vi licensee using various strategy to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their supplier that result in lowering the wholesale licensee selling price on which the royalty is calculated in addition certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported and or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property and licensee and or company may continue to do in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report and or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or not enter into new license agreement further to the extent such licensee and or company increase their device share the negative impact of their underreporting underpayment non payment and or non reporting on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and or cash flow will be exacerbated we are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigation and or proceeding some of which have arisen and may continue to arise out of the strategy described above certain legal matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and or cash flow depending on the type of matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer and or modify or renegotiate our existing license agreement and or determination that all or portion of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable in addition decision or order arising out of governmental investigation or proceeding could require to renegotiate or could encourage or embolden our licensee to demand to renegotiate their license agreement with which could be on term that are le favorable to than existing term and such licensee may underreport underpay not report not pay royalty owed to pending the conclusion of such negotiation further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region see also the risk factor entitled change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation in addition in connection with our participation in sdos we like other patent owner generally have made contractual commitment to such organization to license those of our patent that would necessarily be infringed by standard compliant product set forth in those commitment some manufacturer and user of standard compliant product advance interpretation of these commitment that are adverse to our licensing business including interpretation that would limit the amount of royalty that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio further some company or entity have proposed significant change to existing intellectual property policy for implementation by sdos and other industry organization with the goal of significantly devaluing standard essential patent for example some have put forth proposal which would require maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard essential patent owned by all of the member company to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard they have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard essential patent based upon the number of standard essential patent held by such company others have proposed that injunction not be an available remedy for infringement of standard essential patent and or have made proposal that could severely limit damage award and other remedy by court for patent infringement by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied number of these strategy are purportedly based on interpretation of the policy of certain sdos concerning the licensing of patent that are or may be essential to industry standard and on our and or other company alleged failure to abide by these policy some sdos court and governmental agency have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretation or proposal in manner adverse to our interest including in litigation to which we may not be party we expect that such proposal interpretation and strategy will continue in the future and if successful our business model would be harmed either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalty or by reducing the royalty we can collect on all or portion of our patent portfolio limiting our return on investment with respect to new technology limiting our ability to seek injunction against infringers of our standard essential patent constraining our ability to make licensing commitment when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standard which could make our technology le likely to be included in such standard or forcing to work outside of sdos or other industry group to promote our new technology and our revenue result of operation and or cash flow could be negatively impacted in addition the legal and other cost associated with asserting or defending our position have been and continue to be significant we assume that such challenge regardless of their merit will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource our business particularly our licensing business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding we are currently subject to various governmental investigation and or proceeding particularly with respect to our licensing business and certain such matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation in those matter include among others that we do not license our cellular standard essential patent separately from our other patent that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to grant license to chipset maker that our royalty rate are high and or that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow depending on the type of matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer and or modify or renegotiate our existing license agreement and or determination that all or portion of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable in addition decision or order arising out of such governmental investigation or proceeding could require to renegotiate or could encourage or embolden our licensee to demand to renegotiate their license agreement with which could be on term that are le favorable to than existing term and such licensee may underreport underpay not report or not pay royalty owed to pending the conclusion of such negotiation further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region see also the risk factor entitled change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation we are currently subject to various governmental investigation and private legal proceeding challenging our patent licensing practice described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation in those matter include among others that we do not license our cellular standard essential patent separately from our other patent that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to grant license to chipset maker that our royalty rate are too high and or that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction we believe that the ultimate intent of these investigation and legal proceeding is to reduce the amount of royalty that licensee are required to pay to for their use of our intellectual property we have historically licensed our cellular standard essential patent together with our other patent that may be useful to licensed product because licensee typically have desired to obtain the commercial benefit of receiving such broad patent right from however we also have licensed only our cellular standard essential patent to certain licensee who have requested such license in addition in connection with our resolution with the china national development and reform commission ndrc our standard practice in china since is to offer license to our and standard essential chinese patent for device sold for use in china separately from our other patent in addition we offer license to only our cellular standard essential patent including and for both single mode and multi mode device worldwide number of our licensee have entered into standard essential patent only agreement on worldwide basis and we expect more of our licensee may do so in the future our royalty rate for license to only our cellular standard essential patent are lower than our royalty rate for license to substantially all of our patent portfolio if more licensee choose license to only our cellular standard essential patent instead of portfolio license than ha historically been the case our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patent at rate that offset all or portion of any difference between the royalty previously received for license of substantially all of our patent portfolio compared to license of only our cellular standard essential patent and or there wa sufficient increase in the overall volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid if we were required to grant patent license to chipset manufacturer to implement more complex tiered licensing structure in which we license certain portion of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturer and other portion to device manufacturer we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we could incur delay in recognizing revenue license negotiation were completed in addition our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain in the aggregate equivalent revenue under such multi level licensing structure if we were required to reduce the royalty rate we charge under our patent license agreement our revenue earnings and or cash flow would be negatively impacted absent sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid similarly if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated our revenue result of operation and or cash flow would be negatively impacted unless there wa sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid and or we were able to increase our royalty rate to offset the decrease in revenue resulting from such lower royalty base assuming the absolute royalty dollar were below any relevant royalty cap to the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing practice by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreement we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we could incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed the impact of any such change to our licensing practice could vary widely and by jurisdiction depending on the specific outcome and the geographic scope of such outcome in addition if we were required to make modification to our licensing practice in one jurisdiction licensee and or governmental agency in other jurisdiction may attempt to obtain similar outcome for and or for such other jurisdiction applicable the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property right may be expensive could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property right could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patent and or could be adversely affected by change in patent law by law in certain foreign jurisdiction that may not effectively protect our intellectual property right and or by ineffective enforcement of law in such jurisdiction rely primarily on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law well nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement international treaty and other method to protect our proprietary information technology and process including our patent portfolio policing unauthorized use of our product technology and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming the step we have taken have not always prevented and we can not be certain the step we will take in the future will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technology particularly in foreign country where the law may not protect our proprietary intellectual property right fully or readily law or where the enforcement of such law may be lacking or ineffective some industry participant who have vested interest in devaluing patent in general or standard essential patent in particular have mounted attack on certain patent system increasing the likelihood of change to established patent law in the united state there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law change and current and potential future litigation regarding patent the outcome of which could be detrimental to our licensing business the law in certain foreign country in which our product are or may be manufactured or sold including certain country in asia may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law in the united state we expect that the european union will adopt unitary patent system in the next few year that may broadly impact that region patent regime we can not predict with certainty the long term effect of any potential change in addition we can not be certain that the law and policy of any country or the practice of any standard body foreign or domestic with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standard will not be changed in the future in way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our product or technology we have and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstance in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property right and or contract including collecting royalty for use of our patent portfolio due to among others refusal by certain licensee to report and or pay all or portion of the royalty they owe to policy of foreign government challenge to our licensing practice under competition law adoption of mandatory licensing provision by foreign jurisdiction either with controlled regulated royalty or royalty free failure of foreign court to recognize and enforce judgment of contract breach and damage issued by court in the united state and or challenge competition agency to our licensing business and or the pricing and integration of additional feature and functionality into our chipset product certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported and or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreement for their use of our intellectual property and such licensee and or company may continue to do so in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report and or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or not enter into new license agreement additionally although our license agreement provide with the right to audit the book and record of licensee audit can be expensive time consuming incomplete and subject to dispute further certain licensee may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their book and record to the extent we do not aggressively enforce our right under our license agreement licensee may not comply with their existing license agreement and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed company to enter into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property other unlicensed company may not enter into license agreement similarly we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and or proprietary and or confidential business information to our direct and indirect customer and licensee who may wrongfully use such intellectual property and or information and or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and or information to third party including our competitor we have entered into litigation and or arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate and or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and or intellectual property right protect our trade secret or determine the validity and scope of proprietary right of others we are currently engaged in litigation matter related to protecting or enforcing our contract and or intellectual property right and certain such matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency result of any such litigation and or arbitration we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patent portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable which may in turn result in other licensee either not complying with their existing license agreement and or initiating litigation and or we could incur substantial cost any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property right could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention which in turn could negatively impact our result of operation and or cash flow further even positive resolution to our enforcement effort may take time to conclude which may reduce our revenue and cash resource available for other purpose such research and development in the period prior to conclusion see also the risk factor entitled change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technology product and service into new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment and or application outside of traditional cellular such automotive iot and networking among others our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and industry segment and related technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such may not generate operating income or contribute to future result of operation that meet our expectation our industry is subject to rapid technological change evolving industry standard and frequent new product introduction and we must make substantial research development and other investment such acquisition in new product service and technology to compete successfully technological innovation generally require significant research and development effort before they are commercially viable while we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement primarily in support of and based technology we also innovate across broad spectrum of opportunity to deploy new and expanded product and enter into adjacent industry segment and or application by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and or through acquisition in particular our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment and or application such automotive iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics networking computing and ai such machine learning among others our ability to develop leading and cost effective technology product and service for new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and third party incorporating our technology product and service into device used in these product area industry segment and or application accordingly we intend to continue to make substantial investment in these new and expanded product area adjacent industry segment and or application and in developing new product service and technology for these product area industry segment and or application our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop technology and to develop and commercialize product using technology however our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area adjacent industry segment and or application and corresponding technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such use of licensed shared and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and wi fi may not succeed due to among other reason new industry segment application and or consumer demand may not develop and or grow anticipated our strategy and or the strategy of our customer licensee or partner may not be successful improvement in alternate technology in way that reduce the advantage we anticipate from our investment competitor technology product or service being more cost effective having more capability or fewer limitation or being brought to market faster than our new technology product and service and competitor having longer operating history in industry segment that are new to we may also underestimate the cost of or overestimate the future revenue and or margin that could result from these investment and these investment may not or may take many year to generate material return further the automotive industry is subject to long design in time frame long product life cycle and high degree of regulatory and safety requirement necessitating supplier to the industry to comply with stringent qualification process very low defect rate and high reliability standard all of which result in significant barrier to entry and increased cost if our new technology product and or service are not successful or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate we may incur significant cost and or asset impairment our business may not grow anticipated our revenue and or margin may be negatively impacted and or our reputation may be harmed there are numerous risk associated with our operation and control of the manufacturing facility of our joint venture with tdk holding including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability exposure to natural disaster timely supply of equipment and material and manufacturing difficulty manufacturing facility are characterized by higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model in le favorable industry environment in particular we may be faced with decline in the utilization rate of our manufacturing facility due to decrease in demand for our product during such period our manufacturing facility could operate at lower capacity level while the fixed cost associated with full capacity continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit we are subject to many environmental health and safety law and regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facility which govern among other thing emission of pollutant into the air wastewater discharge the use and handling of hazardous substance waste disposal the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employee we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permit from governmental authority for certain of our operation we can not make assurance that we will be at all time in compliance with such law regulation and permit certain environmental law impose strict and in certain circumstance joint and several liability on current or previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substance certain of these law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated in addition we could also be held liable for consequence arising out of human exposure to hazardous substance or other environmental damage we have manufacturing facility in asia and europe if tsunami flooding earthquake volcanic eruption or other natural disaster or geopolitical conflict were to damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facility it could disrupt our operation delay new production and shipment of inventory or result in costly repair replacement or other cost in addition natural disaster or geopolitical conflict may result in disruption in transportation distribution channel or supply chain or significant increase in the price of raw material our manufacturing operation depend on securing raw material and other supply in adequate quality and quantity in timely manner from multiple supplier and in some case we rely on limited number of supplier particularly in asia accordingly there may be case where supply of raw material and other product are interrupted by disaster accident or some other event at supplier supply is suspended due to quality or other issue or there is shortage of supply due to rapid increase in demand which could impact production and prevent from supplying product to our customer if the supply demand balance is disrupted it may considerably increase cost of manufacturing due to increased price we pay for raw material or fuel from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit the amount supplied to or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor additionally supply of and or cost of raw material may be negatively impacted by trade protection policy such tariff and or escalating trade tension particularly with country in asia further it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another failure by our supplier to deliver our requirement could result in disruption to our manufacturing operation our manufacturing process are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yield and performance difficulty in the production process can reduce yield or interrupt production and result we may not be able to deliver product or do so in timely cost effective or competitive manner further to remain competitive and or meet customer demand we may be required to improve our facility and process technology and carry out extensive research and development each of which may require investment of significant amount of capital and may have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and or cash flow the continued and future success of our licensing program requires to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and our licensing program may be impacted by the proliferation of device in new industry segment such automotive and iot well the need to extend license agreement that are expiring and or to cover additional future patent we own very strong portfolio of issued and pending patent related to and other technology it is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio particularly in if we do not maintain strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standard product and service particularly our future licensing revenue could be negatively impacted in addition new connectivity and other service are emerging that rely on device that may or may not be used on traditional cellular network such device used in the iot and automotive industry segment we also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing program to new industry segment in which we can utilize our technology leadership standard even de facto standard that develop these technology mature in particular those that do not include base level of interoperability may impact our ability to obtain royalty at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for product used in cellular communication although we believe that our patented technology are essential and useful to the commercialization of such service any royalty we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program further the license granted to and from under number of our license agreement include only patent that are either filed or issued prior to certain date result there are agreement with some licensee where later patent are not licensed by or to additionally many of our license agreement including essentially all of our agreement in china and our recent worldwide sep only agreement are effective for specified term in order to license or to obtain license to such later patent or after the expiration of specified term or to receive royalty after the specified time period we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee accordingly to the extent not renewed on their term or by election for an additional generally multi year period if applicable we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee more frequently than we have done historically we might not be able to renew those license agreement or enter into new license agreement in the future without affecting the material term and condition of our license agreement with such licensee and such modification or new agreement may negatively impact our revenue if there is delay in renewing license agreement prior to it expiration there would be delay in our ability to recognize revenue related to that licensee product sale if we are unable to reach agreement on such modification or new agreement it could result in patent infringement litigation with such company we depend on limited number of third party supplier for the procurement manufacture and testing of our product manufactured in fable production model if we fail to execute supply strategy that provide technology leadership supply assurance and low cost our business and result of operation may be harmed we are also subject to order and shipment uncertainty that could negatively impact our result of operation our qct segment primarily utilizes fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made other than the manufacturing facility we now operate through our holding joint venture we rely on independent third party supplier to perform the manufacturing and assembly and most of the testing of our integrated circuit our supplier are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw material used in the production of our integrated circuit we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing model to purchase our integrated circuit under the turnkey model our foundry supplier are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuit under the two stage manufacturing model we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundry and contract with separate third party supplier for manufacturing service such wafer bump probe assembly and the majority of our final test requirement the semiconductor manufacturing foundry that supply product to our qct segment are primarily located in asia are our primary warehouse where we store finished good for fulfillment of customer order the following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and or negatively impact our revenue business operation profitability and or cash flow reduction interruption delay or limitation in our product supply source failure by our supplier to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our product our supplier inability to react to shift in product demand or an increase in raw material or component price our supplier delay in developing leading process technology or inability to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance quality or yield specification or delivery schedule additional expense and or production delay result of qualifying new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier and or natural disaster or geopolitical conflict particularly in asia impacting our supplier additionally supply of and or cost of raw material may be negatively impacted by trade protection policy such tariff and or escalating trade tension particularly with country in asia while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology we rely on sole or limited source supplier for certain product subjecting to significant risk including possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedule manufacturing capability and yield quality assurance quantity and cost to the extent we have established alternate supplier these supplier may require significant level of support to bring complex technology to production result we may invest significant amount of effort and resource and incur higher cost to support and maintain such alternate supplier further any future consolidation of foundry supplier could increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and reduce our supplier willingness to negotiate pricing which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reduction and or which could increase our manufacturing cost our arrangement with our supplier may obligate to incur cost to manufacture and test our product that do not decrease at the same rate decrease in pricing to our customer our ability and that of our supplier to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology and to effectively compete with the manufacturing process and performance of our competitor could impact our ability to introduce new product and meet customer demand could increase our cost possibly decreasing our margin and could subject to the risk of excess inventory our inability to meet customer demand due to sole or limited sourcing and or the additional cost that we incur because of these or other supply constraint or because of the need to support alternate supplier could negatively impact our business our result of operation and or cash flow although we have long term contract with our supplier many of these contract do not provide for long term capacity commitment to the extent we do not have firm commitment from our supplier over specific time period or for any specific quantity our supplier may allocate and in the past have allocated capacity to the production and testing of product their other customer while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our product accordingly capacity for our product may not be available when we need it or at reasonable price to the extent we do obtain long term capacity commitment we may incur additional cost related to those commitment and or make non refundable payment for capacity commitment that are not used one or more of our supplier or potential alternate supplier may manufacture cdma or ofdma based integrated circuit that compete with our product such supplier could elect to allocate raw material and manufacturing capacity to their own product and reduce or limit delivery to to our detriment in addition we may not receive reasonable pricing manufacturing or delivery term from our supplier we can not guarantee that the action of our supplier will not cause disruption in our operation that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation to our customer or increase our cost of sale additionally we place order with our supplier using our and or our customer forecast of customer demand which are based on number of assumption and estimate we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase result the order we place with our supplier are generally only partially covered by commitment from our customer if we or our customer overestimate customer demand that is not under binding commitment from our customer we may experience increased excess and or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our result of operation claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business from time to time company have asserted and may assert patent copyright and other intellectual property right against our product or product using our technology or other technology used in our industry these claim have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation we may not prevail in such litigation given among other factor the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in intellectual property litigation if any of our product or service were found to infringe another company intellectual property right we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our product or service which could be costly or to license such right and or pay damage or other compensation to such other company if we are unable to redesign our product or service license such intellectual property right used in our product or service or otherwise distribute our product through licensed supplier we could be prohibited from making and selling such product or providing such service in any potential dispute involving other company patent or other intellectual property our chipset foundry semiconductor assembly and test provider and customer could also become the target of litigation we are contingently liable under certain product sale service license and other agreement to indemnify certain customer chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider against certain type of liability and or damage arising from qualifying claim of patent infringement by product or service sold or provided by or by intellectual property provided by to our chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider reimbursement under indemnification arrangement could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and or cash flow furthermore any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our product and the business of our chipset customer and their customer which in turn could hurt our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale and or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset and or licensing revenue any claim regardless of their merit could be time consuming to address result in costly litigation divert the effort of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delay any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow we expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative body such the united state international trade commission to defend against patent assertion against our product by company some of are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiation we may not be successful in such proceeding and if we are not the range of possible outcome is very broad and may include for example monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money royalty payment injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit product and or on the sale of our customer device using such product and or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customer and their wireless operator customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our worldwide chipset sale and or reduction in our licensee sale to wireless operator causing corresponding decline in our chipset and or licensing revenue certain legal matter including certain claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency may engage in strategic acquisition transaction or make investment or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisition which could adversely affect our result of operation or fail to enhance stockholder value we engage in strategic acquisition and other transaction including joint venture and make investment which we believe are important to the future of our business with the goal of maximizing stockholder value we acquire business and other asset including patent technology wireless spectrum and other intangible asset enter into joint venture or other strategic transaction and purchase minority equity interest in or make loan to company that may be private and early stage our strategic activity are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunity for our technology and supporting the design and introduction of new product and service or enhancing existing product or service for voice and data communication and new industry segment recent material transaction include our holding joint venture with tdk corporation and our acquisition of csr plc many of our strategic activity entail high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and or foreign capital and investment may not become liquid for several year after the date of the investment if at all our strategic activity may not generate financial return or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technology product or service we may underestimate the cost and or overestimate the benefit including product revenue cost and other synergy and growth opportunity that we expect to realize and we may not achieve those benefit in some case we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or loss of company in which we have acquired ownership interest in addition we may record impairment charge related to our strategic activity any loss or impairment charge that we incur related to strategic activity will have negative impact on our financial condition and result of operation and we may continue to incur new or additional loss related to strategic asset or investment that we have not fully impaired or exited achieving the anticipated benefit of business acquisition including joint venture and other strategic investment in which we have management and operational control depends in part upon our ability to integrate the business in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergy and we may not be successful in these effort such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenge including among others retaining key employee successfully integrating new employee technology product process operation including manufacturing operation sale and distribution channel business model and business system retaining customer and supplier of the business consolidating research and development and or supply operation minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business matter consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and managing the increased scale complexity and globalization of our business operation and employee base we may not derive any commercial value from associated technology or product or from future technology or product based on these technology and we may be subject to liability that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain and we may become subject to litigation additionally we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sale or distribution channel business or operational model including manufacturing geographic region industry segment and or category of product served by or adjacent to the associated business or in addressing potential new opportunity that may arise out of the combination if we do not achieve the anticipated benefit of business acquisition or other strategic activity our business and result of operation may be adversely affected and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transaction in fiscal we terminated our proposed acquisition of nxp since the acquisition had not been approved by the state administration for market regulation samr in china by the date specified in the acquisition agreement result we will not realize the benefit that we anticipated from the acquisition including but not limited to increased revenue accelerated revenue diversification significantly expanded addressable market and opportunity accelerated entry into new industry segment and expansion in existing industry segment new and expanded product offering and technology accelerated expansion of sale and distribution channel cost and other synergy and earnings accretion from the acquisition in addition future acquisition may now be more difficult complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisition ha been harmed further if china trade relation remain strained our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from samr may be severely impacted if we are unsuccessful in executing our cost plan our business and result of operation may be adversely affected in the

which have been significant driver of our historical seasonality further starting in the first quarter of fiscal seasonal trend for qtl will be impacted by the adoption of the new guidance related to revenue recognition pursuant to which we will be required to estimate and recognize sale based royalty in the period in which the associated sale occur resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition by one quarter compared to the current method we have also experienced fluctuation in revenue due to the timing of conversion and expansion of and network by wireless operator and the

other income net interest and dividend income realized gain on marketable realized gain on other loss on marketable security and other investment equity in net loss of investees gain loss on foreign currency net loss gain on derivative instrument increase in interest expense in fiscal and were primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of billion of unsecured floating and fixed rate note in may may note of which billion were repaid between may and august and fee related to the bridge and term loan facility entered into during the first quarter of fiscal which terminated in july in the first quarter of fiscal we began divesting substantial portion of our marketable security portfolio in order to finance in part the then proposed acquisition of nxp result we recorded net realized gain and impairment loss on such marketable security that we sold and expected to sell before their anticipated recovery respectively in fiscal the net gain on foreign currency transaction in fiscal which were partially offset by loss on derivative instrument were primarily attributable to currency exchange rate movement on amount accrued for the ec and tftc fine well the impact of currency exchange rate movement on certain monetary asset and liability of our holding joint venture income tax expense in million change changeincome tax expense effective tax raten not meaningful following table summarizes the primary factor that caused our annual tax provision to differ from the expected income tax provision at the united state federal statutory rate in million income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate income tax provision net of federal charge from tax benefit from foreign income taxed at other than rate valuation allowance on deferred tax asset related to nxp termination remeasurement of deferred tax due to change in statutory rate due to tax benefit related to research and development tax credit nondeductible charge and reversal related to the ec kftc and tftc investigation tax on undistributed foreign impact of change in tax reserve and audit settlement for prior year tax position worthless stock deduction of domestic subsidiary tax expense tax cut and job act the tax legislation in the united state enacted on december significantly revised the united state corporate income tax by among other thing lowering the corporate income tax rate to effective january implementing modified territorial tax system and imposing one time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profit of owned foreign subsidiary the toll charge fiscal year taxpayer certain provision of the tax legislation impacted in fiscal including the change in the corporate income tax rate and the toll charge while other provision will be effective starting at the beginning of fiscal including the implementation of modified territorial tax system accordingly our federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal reflected blended rate of approximately result of the tax legislation we recorded charge of billion to income tax expense in fiscal comprised of billion related to the estimated toll charge and million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax asset and liability that existed at the end of fiscal at lower enacted corporate income tax rate which included million tax benefit in fiscal related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability that wa established result of change in one of our position due to tax legislation income tax expense for fiscal wa further negatively impacted by the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the termination fee paid to nxp which did not result in tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss fiscal and income tax expense wa also impacted by the ec kftc and tftc fine and settlement with the tftc which are not deductible for tax purpose and portion of which were attributable to foreign jurisdiction and to the united state these impact were partially offset in fiscal and by lower revenue primarily related to decreased royalty revenue from apple contract manufacturer and for fiscal the blackberry arbitration income tax expense for fiscal also reflected the increase in our singapore tax rate result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentive in march which wa substantially offset by tax benefit resulting from the increase in our singapore tax rate that will be in effect when certain deferred tax asset are scheduled to reverse during the third quarter of fiscal we entered into new tax incentive agreement in singapore that result in reduced tax rate from march through march provided that we meet specified employment and investment criterion in singapore our singapore tax rate will increase in march result of expiration of these incentive and again in march upon the expiration of tax incentive under prior agreement result of this new tax incentive our income tax expense for fiscal wa reduced by approximately million unrecognized tax benefit were million and million at september and september respectively the decrease in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to an agreement with the irs related to tax position on the classification of income in our fiscal federal income tax return we believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit at september may increase or decrease in the next month result of the tax legislation in fiscal several of our foreign subsidiary will make tax election to be treated branch for federal income tax purpose commonly referred to check the box election effective beginning in fiscal and we believe that by these foreign subsidiary being treated branch for federal income tax rather than controlled foreign corporation we will significantly reduce the risk of being subject to gilti global intangible low taxed income and beat base erosion anti abuse tax tax both of which are effective for starting in fiscal result of making these check the box election in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to record an estimated tax benefit of million to million due to establishing new net deferred tax asset resulting from the difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax carryover basis of the existing asset and liability of those foreign subsidiary primarily related to customer incentive liability that have not been deducted for tax purpose we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and are currently under examination by various tax authority worldwide most notably in country where we earn routine return and tax authority believe substantial value add activity are performed these examination are at various stage with respect to assessment claim deficiency and refund we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact give rise to revision become known of september we believe that adequate amount have been reserved for based on fact known however the final determination of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our income tax provision and the related accrual segment resultsthe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal and result of operation for each

agreement with the other licensee in dispute this represents partial payment for royalty due after the second quarter of fiscal by that other licensee while negotiation continue and it doe not reflect the full amount of royalty due under the underlying license agreement we did not record any revenue in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal for royalty due on the sale of the other licensee product and the other licensee underpaid royalty due in the second quarter of fiscal which negatively impacted qtl revenue by an estimated amount in excess of million royalty revenue related to the product of apple contract manufacturer and the other licensee in dispute were approximately billion in fiscal revenue related to the product of apple contract manufacturer and the other licensee in dispute

product and service and new consumer demand for product and service around the world driven primarily by smartphones we also expect growth in new device category and industry driven by the expanding adoption of certain technology that are already commonly used in smartphones by industry segment outside traditional cellular industry such automotive iot and networking we look forward to the next several month and beyond we expect our business to be impacted by the following key item in the second quarter of fiscal we announced cost plan designed to align our cost structure to our long term margin target part of this plan we continue to execute on series of targeted action across our business to reduce annual cost by billion excluding incremental cost resulting from any future acquisition of business we expect these cost reduction to be fully captured in fiscal in connection with this plan we expect to incur additional restructuring and restructuring related charge of up to million and we incurred million in restructuring and restructuring related charge in fiscal regulatory authority in certain jurisdiction continue to investigate our business practice and other regulatory authority may do so in the future unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business with remedy that include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or modify our business practice additionally certain of our direct and indirect customer and licensee including apple have pursued and others may in the future pursue litigation or arbitration against related to our business unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have in the past had material adverse effect on our business and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business including among others monetary damage the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent and or portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable these activity have required and we expect that they will continue to require the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted and we expect that they will continue to result in increased legal cost until the respective matter are resolved see note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency and risk factor included in this annual report we are currently in dispute with apple surrounding what we believe is an attempt by apple to reduce the amount of royalty that it contract manufacturer who are our licensee are required to pay to for use of our intellectual property in fiscal such contract manufacturer did not fully report and did not pay royalty due on sale of apple product we have taken action against apple contract manufacturer to compel them to pay the required royalty and against apple described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we did not record any revenue in fiscal or in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal for royalty due on sale of apple product and result qtl revenue and ebt were negatively impacted by these continued dispute we expect these company will continue to take such action in the future resulting in increased legal cost and negatively impacting our future revenue well our financial condition result of operation and cash flow until the respective dispute are resolved in the third of fiscal we entered into an interim agreement with the other licensee in dispute in which that licensee agreed to pay million partial payment for royalty due after the second quarter of fiscal that licensee paid million in fiscal partial payment while negotiation continue this payment doe not reflect the full amount of royalty due under the underlying license agreement if we do not reach final agreement with that other licensee it may not make any other payment or may not make full payment under the underlying license agreement which may result in increased legal cost due to exercising the dispute resolution provision in the license agreement and will negatively impact our future revenue well our financial condition result of operation and cash flow until the dispute is resolved to position qtl for stability on long term basis we have announced that our cellular standard essential patent only licensing term including and through release for both single mode and multi mode device worldwide will remain at the same rate consistent with our licensing program established in china for and device number of our licensee have entered into cellular standard essential patent only agreement on worldwide basis and we expect more of our licensee may enter into such cellular standard essential patent only agreement in the future in addition in fiscal we have reduced the per unit royalty cap on smartphones which is the base on which our royalty are calculated while we expect these development to enhance stability for the long term they will negatively impact qtl royalty revenue we expect our business particularly qct to continue to be impacted by industry dynamic including concentration of device share among few company within the premium tier resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those company and exacerbating the negative impact to our business and financial result if any of those company do not utilize our chipsets decision by company to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product and or sell such product to others including by bundling with other product increasing competition decision by certain company to utilize our competitor integrated circuit product in all or portion of their device for example we have not been the sole supplier of modem for iphone product beginning with product that launched in september apple utilizes modem from one or more of our competitor in portion of such device apple is solely using one or more of our competitor modem rather than our modem in it iphone release and may take similar action in the future accordingly qct revenue from modem sale for iphones have declined in fiscal are expected to further decline in fiscal and may fluctuate in the future in part depending on the extent of apple utilization of competitor modem and the mix of the various version of it product that are sold overall qct revenue well profitability may similarly decline unless offset by sale of integrated circuit product to other customer including those outside of traditional cellular industry such the iot automotive and networking apple sourcing of integrated circuit product doe not impact our licensing revenue since our licensing revenue from apple product are not dependent upon whether such product include our chipsets intense competition particularly in china our competitor expand their product offering and or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to attract new and or retain existing customer continued growth of device share by chinese oems in china and in region outside of china lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where the smartphone industry is mature premium tier smartphones are common and consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle lengthening replacement cycle in emerging region smartphone penetration increase and increasing consumer demand for smartphone product in emerging region driven by availability of lower tier device current china trade relation may negatively impact our business growth prospect and result of operation we expect the ongoing rollout of service in emerging region will encourage competition and growth bringing the benefit of lte multi mode to consumer we continue to invest significant resource to develop our wireless baseband chip and our converged computing communication snapdragon chipsets which incorporate technology in the following area among others advancement in and ofdm based wi fi rffe connectivity power management graphic audio and codecs multimedia artificial intelligence ai and virtual augmented reality and all of which contribute to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio we are also investing in targeted opportunity that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business model and enter and or expand into new industry segment and application such product for automotive iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics networking computing and ai such machine learning among others we expect initial commercial network deployment and device launch to begin in calendar we believe that technology will empower new era of smartphones and connected device we also believe that will drive transformation across industry beyond traditional cellular communication that will create new business model and new service we believe it is important that we remain leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing of technology and to be leading developer and supplier of integrated circuit product and service in order to sustain and grow our business long term in addition to the foregoing business and market based matter we continue to devote resource to working with and educating participant in the wireless value chain and government to the benefit of our licensing program and our extensive technology investment in promoting highly competitive and innovative wireless industry however we expect that certain company may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalty for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our licensing program in enabling new highly cost effective competitor to their product we expect that such company and or government or regulator will continue to challenge our business model in various forum throughout the world further discussion of risk related to our business is presented in part item risk factor included in this annual report liquidity and capital resourcesour principal source of liquidity are our existing cash cash equivalent and marketable security cash generated from operation cash

operating activity and the release of the restriction on billion of deposit used to collateralize the letter of credit related to our proposed acquisition of nxp upon termination of the letter of credit net cash provided by operating activity decreased primarily due to the billion termination fee paid to nxp and the continued action taken by apple and it contract manufacturer who did not report or pay royalty due in fiscal partially offset by the effect of the million payment in connection with the blackberry arbitration in fiscal and the million payment of the fine related to the kftc investigation in fiscal our day sale outstanding on consolidated basis decreased to day at september compared to day at september the decrease in account receivable and the related day sale outstanding were primarily due to the timing of integrated circuit shipment and the collection of receivables from certain licensee the decrease in inventory wa primarily due to decrease in the overall quantity of unit on hand debt our amended and restated revolving credit facility provides for unsecured revolving facility loan swing line loan and letter of credit in the aggregate amount of billion of which million and billion will expire february and november respectively at september no amount were outstanding under the revolving credit facility we have an unsecured commercial paper

purchase agreement we repurchased the million of new note issued in may in may we issued an aggregate principal amount of billion in eight tranche of unsecured floating and fixed rate note of which billion remains outstanding with maturity date in through effective interest rate were between and at september interest is payable in arrears quarterly for the floating rate note and semi annually for the fixed rate note we may issue additional debt in the future the amount and timing of such additional debt will be subject to number of factor including the cash flow generated by our operation acquisition and strategic investment acceptable interest rate and change in corporate income tax law among other factor additional information regarding our outstanding debt at september is provided in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note debt income tax the tax legislation which wa signed into law during the first quarter of fiscal resulted in an estimated billion charge related to the toll charge we currently estimate that we will pay billion for the toll charge after application of certain tax credit which is payable in installment over eight year in each of the first five year in year six in year seven and in year eight beginning on january this amount may be reduced by excess tax benefit generated in fiscal we have historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest the operating earnings of certain non subsidiary outside the united state based on our plan for use and or investment outside of the united state and our belief that our source of cash and liquidity in the united state would be sufficient to meet future domestic cash need the tax legislation eliminated certain material tax effect on the repatriation of cash to the united state future repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiary will generally not be subject to federal income tax result we reevaluated our historic assertion and of september we no longer consider substantially all of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiary additional information regarding our income tax is provided in this annual report

stock repurchase program ha significantly reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of cash that we have available to fund our operation including research and development working capital capital expenditure acquisition investment dividend and other corporate purpose and increase our exposure to adverse economic market industry and competitive condition and development and other change in our

working and other capital requirement in addition to the above matter also include the item described below we expect the majority of the charge incurred in connection with our cost plan will result in cash payment our restructuring accrual wa million at september and we expect to incur additional restructuring and restructuring related charge of up to million our purchase obligation at september

the future lease payment related to our holding joint venture manufacturing facility under construction note have not been presented in the table above the lease term will commence upon completion of

long term liability reflected on our balance sheet such unearned revenue are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future other long term liability presented in this table include the related current portion applicable our consolidated balance sheet at september included million in other noncurrent liability for uncertain tax position some of which may result in cash payment the future payment related to uncertain tax position recorded other noncurrent liability have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authority additional information regarding our financial commitment at september is provided in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note income tax note debt and note commitment and contingency accounting estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our estimate on historical and anticipated result and trend and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance including assumption to future event by their nature estimate are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty although we believe that our estimate and the assumption supporting our assessment are reasonable actual result that differ from our estimate could be material to our consolidated financial statement summary of our significant accounting policy is included in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note significant accounting policy we consider the following accounting estimate to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement impairment of other investment we hold investment in non marketable equity instrument in privately held company that are accounted for using either the cost or the equity method many of these investment are in early stage company which are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product of these company are uncertain and may never develop we monitor our investment for event or circumstance that could indicate the investment are impaired such deterioration in the investee financial condition and business forecast and lower valuation in recently completed or proposed financing and we record impairment loss in earnings when we believe an investment ha experienced decline in value that is other than temporary valuation of inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer among other thing this valuation also requires to make judgment and assumption based on information currently available about market condition including competition product pricing product life cycle and development plan we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase resulting in an increased reliance on our own forecast of customer demand rather than our customer forecast if we overestimate demand for our product the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchase from our supplier our assumption of future product demand are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material write down in the future valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived and long lived asset our business combination typically result in the recording of goodwill other intangible asset and or property plant and equipment and the recorded value of those asset may become impaired in the future we also acquire intangible asset and property plant and equipment in other type of transaction the determination of the recorded value of intangible asset acquired in business combination requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect our consolidated financial statement for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumption that require significant judgment for example the income approach generally requires to use assumption to estimate future cash flow including those related to total addressable market pricing and share forecast competition technology obsolescence future tax rate and discount rate our estimate of the fair value of certain asset may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumption or utilize different business model and from the future cash flow actually realized goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment and in interim period if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator and future cash flow related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset may be based on operational performance of our business market condition expected selling price and or other factor although there are inherent uncertainty in this assessment process the estimate and assumption we use including estimate of future cash flow and discount rate are consistent with our internal planning when appropriate if these estimate or their related assumption change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge on portion or all of our goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and or long lived asset furthermore we can not predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering event nor the impact such event might have on our reported asset value future event could cause to conclude that impairment indicator exist and that goodwill or other intangible asset with our acquired business are impaired any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and result of operation during fiscal and we recorded million million and million respectively in impairment charge for goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset the estimated fair value of our qct and qtl reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value at september legal and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding and we intend to continue to vigorously defend litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular investigation by antitrust and trade regulation agency are not conducted in consistent manner across jurisdiction further each country and agency ha different set of law rule and regulation both substantive and procedural well different legal principle theory and potential remedy and some agency may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goal depending on the jurisdiction these investigation can involve non transparent procedure under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theory or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency unlike in civil litigation in the united state in foreign proceeding we may not be entitled to discovery or deposition allowed to cross examine witness or confront our accuser result we may not be aware of and may not be entitled to know all allegation against or the information or document provided to or discovered or prepared by the agency accordingly we may have little or no idea what an agency intent is with respect to liability penalty or the timing of decision in many case the agency are given significant discretion and any available precedent may have limited if any predictive value in their jurisdiction much le in other jurisdiction accordingly we can not predict the outcome of these matter however the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow broad range of remedy with respect to our business practice that are deemed to violate applicable law are potentially available these remedy may include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or to modify our business practice if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred associated with loss contingency we disclose such fact and if reasonably estimable we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal or regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability including the probability of loss related to pending legal or regulatory proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether loss is reasonably estimable revision in our estimate of the potential liability could materially impact our result of operation income tax we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and the assessment of our income tax position involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in various taxing jurisdiction in addition the application of tax law and regulation is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax law and regulation themselves are

legislation related to the toll charge we have made reasonable estimate of the effect and recorded provisional amount in our consolidated financial statement the impact of the tax legislation related to the toll charge may differ from this estimate during the remainder of the one year measurement period due to among other thing further refinement of our calculation change in interpretation and assumption we have made guidance that may be issued and action we may take result of the tax legislation we are in the process of analyzing the effect of new tax due on certain foreign income such gilti global intangible low taxed income beat base erosion anti abuse tax and fdii foreign derived intangible income and limitation on interest expense deduction if certain condition apply all of

expected market volatility the market and economy in general analyst recommendation and price target view of external investment manager news or financial information that ha been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates if debt security market value is below amortized cost and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before it anticipated recovery we record an other than temporary impairment charge to investment and other income net for the entire amount of the impairment for the remaining debt security if an other than temporary impairment exists we separate the other than temporary impairment into the portion of the loss related incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsto credit factor or the credit loss portion which is recorded charge to investment and other income net and the portion of the loss that is not related to credit factor or the noncredit loss portion which is recorded component of other accumulated comprehensive income net of income tax for equity security we consider the loss relative to the expected volatility and the likelihood of recovery over reasonable period of time if event and circumstance indicate that decline in the value of an equity security ha occurred and is other than temporary we record charge to investment and other income net for the difference between fair value and cost at the balance sheet date additionally if we either have the intent to sell the equity security or do not have both the intent and the ability to hold the equity security until it anticipated recovery we record charge to investment and other income net for the difference between fair value and cost at the balance sheet date equity and cost method investment we generally account for non marketable equity investment either under the equity or the cost method equity investment for which we have significant influence but not control over the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee activity are accounted for under the equity method other non marketable equity investment are accounted for under the cost method our share of gain and loss in equity method investment are recorded in investment and other income net we monitor non marketable equity investment

counterparties to our derivative instrument are all major banking institution interest rate swap we manage our exposure to certain interest rate risk related to our long term debt through the use of interest rate swap such swap allow to effectively convert fixed rate payment into floating rate payment based on libor these transaction are designated fair value hedge and the gain and loss related to change in the fair value of the interest rate swap substantially offset change in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to change in the market interest

appropriate through the use of derivative instrument including foreign currency forward and option contract with financial counterparties that may or may not be designated hedging instrument these derivative instrument have maturity date of le than twelve month gain and loss arising from the effective portion of such contract that are designated cash flow hedging instrument are recorded component of accumulated other comprehensive income gain and loss on derivative instrument net of income tax the hedging gain and loss in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently reclassified to revenue or cost and expense applicable in the consolidated statement of operation in the same period in which the underlying transaction affect our earnings gain and loss arising from

were follows in million september september renminbi state value measurement fair value is defined the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from source independent of unobservable input are input that reflect our assumption about the factor that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability there are three level of input that may be used to measure fair value incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statement level includes financial instrument for which quoted market price for identical instrument are available in active market level includes financial instrument for which there are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the instrument level includes financial instrument for which fair value is derived from valuation technique in which one or more significant input are unobservable including our own assumption asset and liability are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement we review the fair value hierarchy classification on quarterly basis change in the observability of valuation input may result in reclassification of level for certain security within the fair value hierarchy cash equivalent and marketable security with the exception of auction rate security we obtain pricing information from quoted market price pricing vendor or quote from broker dealer we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to determine whether the input used in the vendor pricing process are deemed to be observable the fair value for interest bearing security includes accrued interest the fair value of treasury security and government related security corporate bond and note and common and preferred stock is generally determined using standard observable input including reported trade quoted market price matrix pricing benchmark yield broker dealer quote issuer spread two sided market and or benchmark security the fair value of debt and equity fund is reported at published net asset value we ass the daily frequency and size of transaction at published net asset value and or the fund underlying holding to determine whether fair value is based on observable or unobservable input the fair value of auction rate security is estimated using discounted cash flow model that incorporates transaction detail such contractual term maturity and timing and amount of future cash flow well assumption related to liquidity default likelihood and recovery the future state of the auction rate market and credit valuation adjustment of market participant though most of the security we hold are pool of student loan guaranteed by the united state government prepayment speed and illiquidity discount are considered significant unobservable input these additional input are generally unobservable and therefore auction rate security are included in level derivative instrument derivative instrument that are traded on an exchange are valued using quoted market price and are included in level derivative instrument that are not traded on an exchange are valued using conventional calculation model that are primarily based on observable input such foreign currency exchange rate volatility and interest rate and therefore such derivative instrument are included in level other investment and other liability other investment and other liability included in level are comprised of our deferred compensation plan liability and related asset which consist of mutual fund classified trading security and are included in other asset other investment and other liability included in level are comprised of convertible debt instrument issued by private company and contingent consideration related to business combination respectively the fair value of convertible debt instrument is estimated based on the estimated timing and amount of future cash flow well assumption related to liquidity default likelihood and recovery the fair value of contingent consideration related to business combination is estimated using either real option approach or discounted cash flow model both of which include input such projected financial information market volatility discount rate and timing of contractual payment the input we use to estimate the fair value of the convertible debt instrument and contingent consideration are generally unobservable and therefore they are included in level allowance for doubtful account we maintain allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment we consider the following factor when determining if collection of required payment is reasonably assured customer credit worthiness past transaction history with the customer current economic industry and or geographic trend change in customer payment term and bank credit worthiness for letter of credit if we have no previous experience with the customer we may request financial information including financial statement or other document to determine that the customer ha the mean of making payment we may also obtain report from various credit organization to determine that the customer ha history of paying it creditor if these factor do not indicate collection is reasonably assured revenue is deferred reduction to account receivable until collection becomes reasonably assured which is generally upon receipt of cash if the financial condition of our customer wa to deteriorate adversely affecting their ability to make payment additional allowance would be required incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsinventories inventory are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer and our own forecast of customer demand among other thing property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life upon the retirement or disposition of property plant and equipment the related cost and accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed and gain or loss is recorded when appropriate building on owned land are depreciated over year and building improvement are depreciated over their useful life ranging from to year leasehold improvement are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life not to exceed year or the remaining term of the related lease other property plant and equipment have useful life ranging from to year leased property meeting certain capital lease criterion is capitalized and the net present value of the related lease payment is recorded liability amortization of asset under capital lease is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term maintenance repair and minor renewal or betterment are charged to expense incurred goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible asset of business acquired acquired intangible asset other than goodwill are amortized over their useful life unless the life are determined to be indefinite for intangible asset purchased in business combination the estimated fair value of the asset received are used to establish their recorded value for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value impairment of goodwill other indefinite lived asset and long lived asset goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim period if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired if qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair value of reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not likelihood of more than le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test will be performed pursuant to the new guidance adopted in the fourth quarter of fiscal if goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment and reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value the difference is recorded an impairment other indefinite lived intangible asset are quantitatively assessed for impairment if necessary by comparing their estimated fair value to their carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the difference is recorded an impairment long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group long lived asset to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value le cost to sell and are not depreciated revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from sale of integrated circuit product and licensing of our intellectual property and also generate revenue through sale of product that connect medical device and by performing software hosting software development and other service the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon variety of factor including the specific term of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverable and obligation unearned revenue consist primarily of license fee for intellectual property with continuing performance obligation revenue from sale of our product are recognized at the time of shipment or when title and risk of loss pas to the customer and all other criterion for revenue recognition are met if later revenue from providing service are recognized when earned revenue from providing service were le than of total revenue for all period presented we grant license or otherwise provide right to use portion of our intellectual property portfolio which among other right includes certain patent right essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless product licensee pay royalty based on their sale of product incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementspay fixed license fee in one or more installment license fee are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee typically to year royalty are generally based upon percentage of the wholesale licensee selling price of complete licensed product net of certain permissible deduction including transportation insurance packing cost and other item we broadly provide per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet and laptop which in general effectively provide for maximum royalty amount per device we earn royalty on such licensed product sold worldwide by our licensee at the time that the licensee sale occur our licensee however do not report and pay royalty owed for sale in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter which is generally the following quarter we recognize royalty revenue based on royalty reported by licensee during the quarter and when all other revenue recognition criterion are met we record reduction to revenue for customer incentive arrangement including volume related and other pricing rebate well cost reimbursement for marketing and other activity involving certain of our product and technology the charge for such arrangement are recorded reduction to account receivable or other current liability based on whether we have the contractual right of offset we recognize the liability based on the estimated amount of the incentive or if not reasonably estimated the maximum potential liability at the later of the date at which we record the related revenue or the date at which we offer the incentive or if payment is contingent when the contingency is resolved we reverse accrual for unclaimed incentive amount to revenue when the unclaimed amount are no longer subject to payment concentration revenue in fiscal and were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with apple inc and hon hai precision industry co ltd foxconn it affiliate and other supplier to apple we did not record any revenue in fiscal or the third or fourth quarter of fiscal for royalty due on sale of apple product significant portion of our revenue are concentrated with small number of customer licensee of our qct and qtl segment revenue from three customer licensee comprised and of total consolidated revenue in fiscal revenue from two customer licensee comprised and in fiscal and and in fiscal excluding the unpaid royalty receivables due from supplier to apple note aggregate account receivable from three customer licensee comprised and of account receivable at september and september respectively we rely on sole or limited source supplier for some product particularly product in the qct segment subjecting to possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology that we consider critical the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance or quality specification or delivery schedule could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation and or negatively impact our revenue business operation and ability to compete for future business shipping and handling cost cost incurred for shipping and handling are included in cost of revenue amount billed to customer for shipping and handling are reported revenue share based compensation share based compensation expense for equity classified award principally related to restricted stock unit rsus is measured at the grant date or at the acquisition date for award assumed in business combination based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized over the employee requisite service period share based compensation expense is adjusted to exclude amount related to share based award that are expected to be forfeited the fair value of rsus are estimated based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or date the rsus are assumed if rsus do not have the right to participate in dividend the fair value are discounted by the dividend yield the weighted average estimated fair value of employee rsus that contain only service requirement to vest granted during fiscal and were and per share respectively upon vesting we issue new share of common stock for the majority of rsus share are issued on the vesting date net of the amount of share needed to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirement to be paid by on behalf of the employee result the actual number of share issued will be fewer than the number of rsus outstanding the annual pre vest forfeiture rate for rsus wa estimated to be approximately and in fiscal and respectively incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementstotal share based compensation expense related to all of our share based award wa comprised follows in million of revenue and general and based compensation expense before income income tax benefit and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular investigation by antitrust and trade regulation agency are not conducted in consistent manner across jurisdiction further each country and agency ha different set of law rule and regulation both substantive and procedural well different legal principle theory and potential remedy and some agency may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goal depending on the jurisdiction these investigation can involve non transparent procedure under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theory or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency unlike in civil litigation in the united state in foreign proceeding we may not be entitled to discovery or deposition allowed to cross examine witness or confront our accuser result we may not be aware of and may not be entitled to know all allegation against or the information or document provided to or discovered or prepared by the agency accordingly we may have little or no idea what an agency intent is with respect to liability penalty or the timing of decision in many case the agency are given significant discretion and any available precedent may have limited if any predictive value in their jurisdiction much le in other jurisdiction accordingly we can not predict the outcome of these matter if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceeding we disclose such fact and if reasonably estimable we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly our legal cost associated with defending ourself are recorded to expense incurred foreign currency certain foreign subsidiary use local currency the functional currency resulting translation gain or loss are recognized component of accumulated other comprehensive income transaction gain or loss related to balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency are recognized in the consolidated statement of operation income tax the asset and liability approach is used to recognize deferred tax asset and liability for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the carrying amount and the tax base of asset and liability tax law and rate change are reflected in income in the period such change are enacted we record valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized we include interest and penalty related to income tax including unrecognized tax benefit within income tax expense we classify all deferred tax asset and liability noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet our income tax return are based on calculation and assumption that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authority in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the position taken on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by tax authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsbeginning in fiscal we recognize excess tax benefit and shortfall tax detriment associated with share based award in the consolidated statement of operation component of income tax expense when realized prior to fiscal we recognized such excess tax benefit and shortfall tax detriment directly to stockholder equity when realized since in the case of shortfall tax detriment we had sufficient apic windfall pool an excess tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by upon an employee disposition of share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset if any associated with the award that we had recorded shortfall tax detriment occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by upon an employee disposition of share based award is le than the deferred tax asset if any associated with the award that we have recorded earnings loss per common share basic earnings loss per common share are computed by dividing net income attributable to qualcomm by the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income attributable to qualcomm by the combination of dilutive common share equivalent comprised of share issuable under our share based compensation plan and share subject to accelerated share repurchase agreement if any and the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the reporting period due to the net loss in fiscal all of the common share equivalent issuable under share based compensation plan and accelerated share repurchase agreement entered into in fiscal had an anti dilutive effect and were therefore excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share the following table provides information about the diluted earnings per share calculation in million common share equivalent included in diluted share of common stock equivalent not included because the effect would be anti dilutive or certain performance condition were not satisfied at the end of the accounting pronouncement share based award in march the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new guidance that changed the accounting for share based award including income tax classification of award and classification in the statement of cash flow we adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with the new guidance excess tax benefit or deficiency associated with share based award are recognized through earnings when the award vest or settle rather than in stockholder equity in fiscal net excess tax benefit associated with share based award of million were recognized in income tax expense in addition cash flow related to excess tax benefit are presented an operating activity and cash payment made on an employee behalf for withheld share are presented financing activity with the prior period adjusted accordingly result of these change amount for fiscal and fiscal have been adjusted follows net cash provided by operating activity increased by million and million respectively with corresponding offset to net cash used in financing activity the new guidance also impact our earnings per share calculation the estimate of dilutive common share equivalent under the treasury stock method no longer assumes that the estimated tax benefit realized when an award is settled are used to repurchase share there wa no impact of this change on our calculation of earnings per share result of the net loss for fiscal we elected to continue our practice of estimating forfeiture expected to occur in determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized each period revenue recognition in may the fasb issued new guidance related to revenue recognition which outline comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance the new guidance requires company to recognize revenue control of good or service transfer to customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those good or service it defines five step approach for recognizing revenue which may require company to use more judgment and make more estimate than under the current guidance we will adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance recognized an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance we currently estimate such adjustment will result in an increase of approximately million to billion to the opening retained earnings balance for fiscal primarily related to the impact described below net of the associated tax effect we have finalized our identification of change to policy process and system well our assessment of data availability and we are in the process of finalizing change to our control and presentation necessary to meet the additional disclosure requirement of the guidance in the note to the consolidated financial statement incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementswe currently expect the adoption of this new guidance to most significantly impact our licensing business qualcomm technology licensing or qtl specifically we expect change in the timing of revenue recognized from sale based royalty which are the vast majority of qtl revenue we currently recognize sale based royalty revenue in the period in which such royalty are reported by licensee which is after the conclusion of the quarter in which the licensee sale occur and when all other revenue recognition criterion are met under the new guidance we will be required to estimate and recognize sale based royalty in the period in which the associated sale occur resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition compared to the current method result of recognizing royalty revenue based on estimate adjustment to revenue will be required in subsequent period based on the actual amount reported by licensee upon adoption of the new guidance license to use portion of our intellectual property portfolio will be considered one performance obligation and license fee will be recognized revenue on straight line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee which is similar to the recognition of license revenue under the current guidance we have historically accounted for customer incentive arrangement in our licensing and semiconductor business including volume related and other pricing rebate or cost reimbursement for marketing and other activity involving certain of our product and technology in part based on the maximum potential liability under the new guidance we will estimate the amount of all customer incentive we do not otherwise expect the adoption of the new guidance to have material impact on our business financial asset in january the fasb issued new guidance on classifying and measuring financial instrument which requires that all equity investment other than equity method investment in unconsolidated entity generally be measured at fair value through earnings and ii when the fair value option ha been elected for financial liability change in fair value due to instrument specific credit risk be recognized separately in other comprehensive income additionally it change the disclosure requirement for financial instrument for equity investment that do not have readily determinable fair value we expect to use the measurement alternative which is defined cost le impairment adjusted by observable price change in orderly transaction for identical or similar investment we anticipate the adoption of the new guidance will increase the volatility of our investment and other income net due to recording the change in fair value of equity investment through earnings we will adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified retrospective transition method for equity investment that have readily determinable fair value with the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and the prospective transition method for equity investment that do not have readily determinable fair value upon adoption the unrealized gain on our marketable security of million at september will be recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings in june the fasb issued new guidance that change the accounting for recognizing impairment of financial asset under the new guidance credit loss for certain type of financial instrument will be estimated based on expected loss the new guidance also modifies the impairment model for available for sale debt security and for purchased financial asset with credit deterioration since their origination the new guidance will be effective for starting in the first quarter of fiscal and generally requires the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption except for certain financial asset where the prospective transition method is required such available for sale debt security for which an other than temporary impairment ha been recorded early adoption is permitted starting in the first quarter of fiscal we are in the process of determining the effect the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statement and whether to adopt the new guidance early lease in february the fasb issued new guidance related to lease that outline comprehensive lease accounting model and supersedes the current lease guidance the new guidance requires lessee to recognize lease liability and corresponding right of use asset for all lease with lease term of greater than month it also change the definition of lease and expands the disclosure requirement of lease arrangement we will adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal and expect to use the modified retrospective approach and to elect certain practical expedient with the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance recognized an adjustment

statement of cash flow in october the fasb issued new guidance that change the accounting for income tax effect of intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory under the new guidance the selling transferring entity is required to recognize current tax expense or benefit upon transfer of the asset similarly the purchasing receiving entity is required to recognize deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability well the related deferred tax benefit or expense upon receipt of the asset we will adopt the new guidance in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified retrospective transition method with the cumulative effect of applying the new guidance recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption we estimate the increase to the opening retained earnings to be approximately billion primarily the result of establishing deferred tax asset on the basis difference of certain intellectual property distributed from one of our foreign subsidiary to subsidiary in the united state in fiscal note in november the fasb issued new guidance related to the classification and presentation of change in restricted cash and cash equivalent in the statement

tax position worthless stock deduction of domestic subsidiary december tax reform legislation known the tax cut and job act the tax legislation wa enacted in the united state the tax legislation significantly revise the united state corporate income tax by among other thing lowering the corporate income tax rate to implementing modified territorial tax system and imposing one time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profit of owned foreign subsidiary the toll charge fiscal year taxpayer certain provision of the tax legislation impacted in fiscal including the change in the corporate income tax rate and the toll charge while other provision will be effective starting at the beginning of fiscal including the implementation of modified territorial tax system the united state federal income tax rate reduction wa effective of january accordingly our federal statutory income tax rate for fiscal reflected blended rate of approximately pursuant to the security and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no income tax accounting implication of the tax cut and job act we have not finalized the accounting for the income tax effect of the tax legislation related to the toll charge further we are in the process of analyzing the effect of new tax due on certain foreign income such gilti global intangible low taxed income beat base erosion anti abuse tax and fdii foreign derived intangible income and limitation on interest expense deduction if certain condition apply all of which are effective starting in fiscal well other provision of the tax legislation we have elected to account for gilti period cost if and when incurred result of recognizing the impact of the tax legislation in income tax expense certain tax effect which were nominal were stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income and we will not reclassify such amount to retained earnings the impact of the tax legislation related to the toll charge may differ from this estimate during the remainder of the one year measurement period due to among other thing further refinement of our calculation change in interpretation and assumption we have made guidance that may be issued and action we may take result of the tax legislation result of the tax legislation we recorded charge of billion to income tax expense in fiscal comprised of billion related to the estimated toll charge and million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsassets and liability that existed at the end of fiscal at lower enacted corporate income tax rate which included million tax benefit recorded in fiscal related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability that wa established result of change in one of our tax position due to tax legislation the toll charge is based on our post earnings and profit of owned foreign subsidiary through december for which we had previously deferred income tax we have not yet finalized our calculation of the total post foreign earnings and profit for the respective foreign subsidiary further the toll charge is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specific asset in addition we remeasured our deferred tax asset and liability that existed at the end of fiscal based on the income tax rate at which they are expected to reverse which primarily assumes the reduced income tax rate of applicable in fiscal resulting in reduction to noncurrent net deferred tax asset of million in fiscal we have historically asserted our intention to indefinitely reinvest the operating earnings of certain non subsidiary outside the united state based on our plan for use and or investment outside of the united state and our belief that our source of cash and liquidity in the united state would be sufficient to meet future domestic cash need the tax legislation eliminated certain material tax effect on the repatriation of cash to the united state future repatriation of cash and other property held by our foreign subsidiary will generally not be subject to federal income tax result we reevaluated our historic assertion and of september we no longer consider substantially all of our foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested in our foreign subsidiary result of our change in assertion during fiscal we recorded charge of million to income tax expense related to outside basis difference that are no longer permanently reinvested we have not recorded deferred tax liability of approximately million related to foreign withholding tax on approximately million of undistributed earnings of certain subsidiary that we continue to consider to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united state should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the united state we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period management make such determination result of the toll charge imposed by the tax legislation we expect to fully utilize all of our unused federal tax credit that existed at the end of fiscal of billion we will elect to pay the toll charge interest free over period of eight year with payment beginning on january we did not discount the amount of the toll charge at september we estimated that we will pay billion for the toll charge which wa net of tax credit carryforwards and tax credit generated through fiscal this amount may be further reduced by excess tax credit generated in fiscal at september million which represents the first installment that is due on january wa included in other current liability with the remaining liability included in noncurrent income tax payable result of the tax legislation in fiscal several of our foreign subsidiary will make tax election to be treated branch for federal income tax purpose commonly referred to check the box election effective beginning in fiscal and we believe that by these foreign subsidiary being treated branch for federal income tax rather than controlled foreign corporation we will significantly reduce the risk of being subject to gilti and beat tax both of which are effective for starting in fiscal result of making these check the box election in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to record an estimated tax benefit of million to million due to establishing new net deferred tax asset resulting from the difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax carryover basis of the existing asset and liability of those foreign subsidiary primarily related to customer incentive liability that have not been deducted for tax purpose additionally during fiscal one of our foreign subsidiary distributed certain intellectual property to subsidiary resulting in difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax basis of the distributed intellectual property upon adoption of the new guidance in the first quarter fiscal that change the accounting for income tax effect of such intra entity transfer of asset note we expect to record an estimated deferred tax asset of approximately billion income tax expense for fiscal wa further negatively impacted by the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the termination fee paid to nxp which did not result in tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss fiscal and income tax expense wa also impacted by the ec kftc and tftc fine and settlement with the tftc which are not deductible for tax purpose and portion of which were attributable to foreign jurisdiction and to the united state these impact were partially offset in fiscal and by lower revenue primarily related to decreased royalty revenue from apple contract manufacturer and for fiscal the blackberry arbitration income tax expense for fiscal also reflected the increase in our singapore tax rate result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentive in march which wa substantially offset by tax benefit resulting from the increase in our singapore tax rate that will be in effect when certain deferred tax asset are scheduled to reverse during the third quarter of fiscal we entered into new tax incentive agreement in singapore that result in reduced tax rate from march incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsthrough march provided that we meet specified employment and investment criterion in singapore our singapore tax rate will increase in march result of expiration of these incentive and again in march upon the expiration of tax incentive under prior agreement result of this new tax incentive our income tax expense for fiscal wa reduced by approximately million without these tax incentive our income tax expense would have been higher and impacted earnings loss per share attributable to qualcomm follows in million except per share amount income tax expense to diluted earnings loss per had deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability follows in million september september tax credit net operating liability and loss on other investment and marketable based gross deferred tax allowance total net deferred tax asset accrued revenue accrued withholding tax unrealized gain on other investment and marketable security other total deferred tax liability net deferred tax asset non current deferred tax asset current deferred tax liability non current deferred tax liability were included in other liability in the consolidated balance sheet at september we had unused federal net operating loss carryforwards of million expiring from through unused state net operating loss carryforwards of million expiring from through and unused foreign net operating loss carryforwards of billion of which billion expire in at september we had unused state tax credit of million of which substantially all may be carried forward indefinitely unused federal tax credit of million expiring from through and unused tax credit of million in foreign jurisdiction expiring from through we do not expect our federal net operating loss carryforwards to expire unused at september we have provided valuation allowance on certain state tax credit foreign deferred tax asset and state net operating loss of million million and million respectively the valuation allowance reflect the uncertainty surrounding our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdiction to utilize our net operating loss and our ability to generate sufficient capital gain to utilize all capital loss incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementswe believe more likely than not that we will have sufficient taxable income after deduction related to share based award to utilize our remaining deferred tax asset summary of the change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefit for fiscal and follows in million balance of unrecognized tax benefit based on prior year tax for prior year tax position and lapse in statute of limitation addition for current year tax with taxing authority ending balance of unrecognized tax benefit believe that it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefit recorded at september may result in cash payment in fiscal unrecognized tax benefit at september included million for tax position that if recognized would impact the effective tax rate the unrecognized tax benefit differ from the amount that would affect our effective tax rate primarily because the unrecognized tax benefit were included on gross basis and did not reflect secondary impact such the federal deduction for state tax adjustment to deferred tax asset and the valuation allowance that might be required if our tax position are sustained the decrease in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to an agreement reached with the irs related to tax position on the classification of income in our fiscal federal income tax return the increase in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to tax position related to transfer pricing we believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefit at september may increase or decrease in fiscal we file income tax return in the united state federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdiction we are currently participant in the irs compliance assurance process whereby we and the irs endeavor to agree on the treatment of all tax issue prior to the tax return being filed we are no longer subject to federal income tax examination for year prior to fiscal we are subject to examination by the california franchise tax board for fiscal year after we are also subject to examination in other taxing jurisdiction in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction most notably in country where we earn routine return and tax authority believe substantial value add activity are performed these examination are at various stage with respect to assessment claim deficiency and refund many of which are open for period after fiscal we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact give rise to
