global regulator such the federal aviation administration faa european union aviation safety agency easa civil aviation administration of china caac and other regulatory body significant trend development the global covid pandemic continues to have material adverse effect on the global airline industry key underlying driver of aviation commercial engine and service business is global commercial air traffic which in turn is driven by economic activity and consumer and business propensity to travel since the beginning of the pandemic in the first quarter of we have seen varied level of recovery in global market government travel restriction public health advisory individual propensity to travel and continued case of the virus have all impacted the level of air travel due to the global airline industry contraction aviation airline and airframe customer are taking measure to address reduced demand which in turn continue to materially impact aviation business operation and financial performance result our long term service agreement billing decreased approximately from the prior year partially mitigated by customer billing for contract termination modification and annual contractual minimum engine flight hour aviation is closely monitoring government action and economic and industry forecast although such forecast continue to evolve and reflect the uncertainty about the severity and duration of the decline in commercial air traffic aviation regularly track global departure which of december were approximately below the pre covid baseline more broadly we are in frequent dialogue with our airline and airframe customer about the outlook for commercial air travel new aircraft production and after market service given the current trend we expect domestic travel route primarily served by narrowbody aircraft to recover before long haul international travel route which are primarily served by widebody aircraft we continue to expect the engine aftermarket recovery to lag departure trend across region and fleet which would result in long term service agreement billing and cash to recover prior to associated revenue and profit consistent with industry projection aviation continues to estimate the duration of the market recovery to be prolonged over multiple year dependent on containing the spread of the virus effective inoculation program and government collaboration to encourage travel particularly around quarantine requirement aviation ha taken several business action to respond to the current adverse environment including reduction of approximately of it total global workforce for the year ended december aviation realized more than billion in operational cost reduction and billion in cash preservation action including headcount reduction of over employee aviation expects to realize cost and cash saving in result of the action taken in and further initiative in the business is actively monitoring the pace of demand recovery to ensure the business is appropriately sized for the future in addition we continue to partner with our airline and leasing customer and are working closely with our airframe partner to align production rate for and beyond aviation operational and financial performance is impacted by commercial air traffic shop visit and spare part demand fleet retirement and demand for new aircraft we monitor and forecast each of these factor part of aviation long term planning process which may result in additional business restructuring action given the uncertainty related to the severity and length of the global covid pandemic and the impact on these factor across the aviation sector and specific customer aviation could be required to record charge impairment or other adverse financial impact in future period if actual result differ significantly from aviation current estimate it relates to the military environment aviation continues to forecast strong military demand creating future growth opportunity for our military business the department of defense and foreign government have continued flight operation and have allocated budget to upgrade and modernize their existing

for the year ended december wa driven primarily by lower interest on borrowing due to repayment of intercompany loan from ge capital and lower loss related to the completion of tender offer to

ge industrial interest and other financial charge of billion and billion were recorded at corporate and billion and billion were recorded by ge industrial segment for the year ended december and respectively ge form the decrease in ge capital interest and other financial charge for the year ended december wa primarily due to lower average borrowing balance due to maturity and decrease in

rate etr provision benefit for income tax cash income tax paid included tax paid related to discontinued operation for the year ended december the consolidated income tax benefit wa billion the change in tax from tax provision in to tax benefit for wa primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non deductible goodwill impairment charge and decrease in valuation allowance on non deferred tax asset partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in compared to the amount recognized on preparatory step for the planned disposition in and decrease in benefit from the completion of the internal revenue service irs audit absent additional tax enacted part of tax reform and non loss without tax benefit our consolidated income tax provision is generally reduced because of the benefit of lower taxed global operation certain non income is subject to local country tax rate that are below the statutory tax rate the rate of tax on our profitable non earnings is below the statutory tax rate because we have significant business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate and because ge fund certain non operation through foreign company that are subject to low foreign tax most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation and of december we have not decided to repatriate these earnings to the given tax reform substantially all of our net prior unrepatriated earnings were subject to tax and accordingly we generally expect to have the ability to repatriate available non cash without additional federal tax cost and any foreign withholding tax on repatriation to the would potentially be partially offset by foreign tax credit substantial portion of the benefit for lower taxed non earnings related to business operation subject to tax in country where the tax on that income is lower than the statutory rate is derived from our gecas aircraft leasing operation located in ireland where the earnings are taxed at our power operation located in switzerland where the earnings are taxed at between and and our aviation operation located in singapore where the earnings are primarily taxed at rate of the rate of tax on non operation is increased however because we also incur loss in foreign jurisdiction where it is not likely that the loss can be utilized and no tax benefit is provided for those loss and valuation allowance against loss carryforwards are provided when it is no longer likely that the loss can be utilized in addition part of tax reform the ha enacted tax on base eroding payment from the we are continuing to undertake restructuring action to mitigate the impact from this provision the ha also enacted minimum tax on foreign earnings global intangible low tax income because we have tangible asset outside the and pay significant foreign tax we generally do not expect significant increase in tax liability from this new minimum tax overall these newly enacted provision increase the rate of tax on our non operation benefit expense from global expense of foreign tax rate difference on non earnings benefit of audit biopharma disposition and preparatory other total benefit expense the amount reported above exclude the impact of tax reform which is reported separate line in the reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to the actual tax rate in note ge form for the year ended december the change from an expense from global operation in to benefit from global operation in reflects the lower rate of tax on the disposition of the biopharma business in compared to an amount of tax recognized on preparatory step for the planned disposition in and decrease in valuation allowance on non deferred tax asset more detailed analysis of difference between the federal statutory rate and the consolidated effective rate well other information about our income tax provision is provided in the critical accounting estimate section and note the nature of business activity and associated income tax differ for ge industrial and for ge capital therefore separate analysis of each is presented in the paragraph that follow ge industrial effective tax industrial ge industrial provision for income tax for the year ended december the ge industrial provision for income tax decreased primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income excluding the gain from the sale of our biopharma business and non deductible goodwill impairment charge and decrease in valuation allowance on non deferred tax asset partially offset by the increase in tax expense associated with the disposition of the biopharma business in compared to the amount recognized on preparatory step for the planned disposition in and decrease in benefit from the completion of the irs audit ge capital effective tax capital ge capital provision benefit for income tax for the year ended december the ge capital tax benefit increased primarily due to the decrease in pre tax income excluding non deductible goodwill impairment charge and due to larger benefit on global

the following provides information on our cash flow in compared with refer to our annual report on form for the year ended december for information regarding cash flow in compared with ge industrial cash flow from continuing operation the most significant source of cash in ge industrial cfoa is customer related activity the largest of which is collecting cash resulting from product or service

guarantee wa insignificant of december and is based on individual transaction level default loss and or return ge form critical accounting estimate accounting estimate and assumption discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statement because they involve significant judgment and uncertainty actual result in these area could differ from management estimate see note for further information on our most significant accounting policy revenue recognition on long term service agreement we have long term service agreement with our customer predominately within our power and aviation segment that require to maintain the customer asset over the contract term which generally range from to year however contract modification that extend or revise contract are not uncommon we recognize revenue we perform under the arrangement using the percentage of completion method which is based on our cost incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected cost this requires to make estimate of customer payment expected to be received over the contract term well the cost to perform required maintenance service customer generally pay based on the utilization of the asset per hour of usage for example or upon the occurrence of major event within the contract such an overhaul result significant estimate in determining expected revenue of contract is estimating how customer will utilize their asset over the term of the agreement the estimate of utilization which can change over the contract life impact both the amount of customer payment we expect to receive and our estimate of future contract cost customer asset utilization will influence the timing and extent of overhaul and other service event over the life of the contract we generally use combination of both historical utilization trend well forward looking information such market condition and potential asset retirement in developing our revenue estimate to develop our cost estimate we consider the timing and extent of future maintenance and overhaul event including the amount and cost of labor spare part and other resource required to perform the service in developing our cost estimate we utilize combination of our historical cost experience and expected cost improvement cost improvement are only included in future cost estimate after saving have been observed in actual result or proven effective through an extensive regulatory or engineering approval process we routinely review estimate under long term service agreement and regularly revise them to adjust for change in outlook these revision are based on objectively verifiable information that is available at the time of the review contract modification that change the right and obligation well the nature timing and extent of future cash flow are evaluated for potential price concession contract asset impairment and significant financing to determine if adjustment of earnings are required before effectively accounting for modified contract new contract we regularly ass expected billing adjustment and customer credit risk inherent in the carrying amount of receivables and contract asset including the risk that contractual penalty may not be sufficient to offset our accumulated investment in the event of customer termination we gain insight into future utilization and cost trend well credit risk through our knowledge of the installed base of equipment and fleet management strategy through close interaction with our customer that come with supplying critical service and part over extended period revision may affect long term service agreement total estimated profitability resulting in an adjustment of earnings on december our net long term service agreement balance of billion represents approximately of our total estimated life of contract billing of billion our contract on average are approximately complete based on cost incurred to date and our estimate of future cost revision to our estimate of future billing or cost that increase or decrease total estimated contract profitability by one percentage point would increase or decrease the long term service agreement balance by billion cash billing collected on these contract were billion and billion during the year ended december and respectively see note and for further information impairment of goodwill and other identified intangible asset we perform our annual goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter in assessing the possibility that reporting unit fair value ha been reduced below it carrying amount due to the occurrence of event or circumstance between annual impairment testing date we consider all available evidence including the result of our impairment testing from the most recent testing date in particular the magnitude of the excess of fair value over carrying value observed ii downward revision to internal forecast or decrease in market multiple and the magnitude thereof if any and iii decline in market capitalization below book value and the magnitude and duration of those decline if any we determine fair value for each of the reporting unit using the market approach when available and appropriate or the income approach or combination of both we ass the valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation if multiple valuation methodology are used the result are weighted appropriately valuation using the market approach are derived from metric of publicly traded company or historically completed transaction of comparable business the selection of comparable business is based on the market in which the reporting unit operate giving consideration to risk profile size geography and diversity of product and service market approach is limited to reporting unit for which there are publicly traded company that have the characteristic similar to our business ge form under the income approach fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flow discounted at an appropriate risk adjusted rate we use our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and include an estimate of long term future growth rate based on our most recent view of the long term outlook for each business we derive our discount rate using capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rate for industry relevant to our reporting unit to estimate the cost of equity financing we use discount rate that are commensurate with the risk and uncertainty inherent in the respective business and in our internally developed forecast discount rate used in our annual reporting unit valuation ranged from to estimating the fair value of reporting unit requires the use of significant judgment that are based on number of factor including actual operating result internal forecast market observable pricing multiple of similar business and comparable transaction possible control premium determining the appropriate discount rate and long term growth rate assumption and if multiple approach are being used determining the appropriate weighting applied to each approach it is reasonably possible that the judgment and estimate described above could change in future period we review identified intangible asset with defined useful life and subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable determining whether an impairment loss ha occurred requires the use of our internal forecast to estimate future cash flow and the useful life over which these cash flow will occur to determine fair value we use our internal cash flow estimate discounted at an appropriate discount rate see note and for further information insurance and investment contract refer to the other item insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimate and assumption in our insurance reserve and their sensitivity to change also see note and for further information pension assumption refer to note for our accounting estimate and assumption related to our postretirement benefit plan income tax our annual tax rate is based on our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate tax law are complex and subject to different interpretation by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authority significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty we review our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operation in addition to local country tax law and regulation this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the historically tax were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings due to the enactment of tax reform repatriation of available cash from foreign earnings are expected to be free of federal income tax but may incur withholding or state tax indefinite reinvestment is determined by management judgment about and intention concerning the future operation of the company most of these earnings have been reinvested in active non business operation at december we have not changed our indefinite reinvestment decision result of tax reform but will reassess this on an ongoing basis we evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax asset by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy which heavily rely on estimate we use our historical experience and our short and long range business forecast to provide insight further our global and diversified business portfolio give the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategy to facilitate the recoverability of future deduction amount recorded for deferred tax asset related to non net operating loss net of valuation allowance were billion and billion at december and respectively of this billion and billion at december and respectively were associated with loss reported in discontinued operation primarily related to our legacy financial service business and billion wa related to held for sale asset at december see other consolidated information income tax section and note and for further information loss contingency loss contingency are uncertain and unresolved matter that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from event or action by others that have the potential to result in future loss such contingency include but are not limited to environmental obligation litigation regulatory investigation and proceeding product quality and loss resulting from other event and development when loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be range of possible cost with equal likelihood liability are based on the low end of such range however the likelihood of loss with respect to particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining meaningful estimate of the loss or range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future event and negotiation with or decision by third party that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency moreover it is not uncommon for such matter to be resolved over many year during which time relevant development and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate range of possible loss disclosure is provided for material loss contingency when loss is probable but reasonable estimate can not be made and when it is reasonably possible that loss will be incurred or the amount of loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review contingency to determine whether the likelihood of loss ha changed and to ass whether reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made see note for further information ge form other itemsinsurance the run off insurance operation of north american life and health nalh primarily include employer reassurance corporation erac and union fidelity life insurance company uflic erac wa formerly part of employer reinsurance corporation erc the sale of erc to swiss re in uflic wa formerly part of genworth financial inc genworth but wa retained by ge after genworth initial public offering in erac primarily assumes long term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various type of reinsurancetreaties and stopped accepting new policy after uflic primarily assumes long term care insurance structured settlementannuities with and without life contingency and variable annuity from genworth and ha been closed to new business since the vast majority of nalh reinsurance exposure are long duration arrangement that still involve substantial level of premiumcollections and benefit payment even though erac and uflic have not entered into new reinsurance treaty in about decade these long duration arrangement involve number of direct writer and contain range of risk transfer provision and other contractual element in many instance these arrangement do not transfer to percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policy issued by the direct writer furthermore we cede insurance risk to third party reinsurers for portion of our insurance contract primarily on long term care insurance policy our run off insurance liability and annuity benefit primarily comprise liability for future policy benefit for those insurance contract claim not yet incurred and claim reserve for claim that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported the insurance liability and annuity benefit amounted to billion and billion and primarily relate to individual long term care insurance reserve of billion and billion and structured settlement annuity and life insurance reserve of billion and billion at december and respectively the increase in insurance liability and annuity benefit of billion from december to december is primarily due to an adjustment of billion resulting from an increase in unrealized gain on investment security that would result in premium deficiency should those gain be realized in addition to nalh electric insurance company eic is property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to ge and it employee with net claim reserve of billion at both december and we regularly monitor emerging experience in our run off insurance operation and industry development to identify trend that may help refine our reserve assumption we believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long term care insurance claim are short term in nature and attributable to covid however the effect of covid including the timing and success of vaccination remain uncertain and may result in variability in level of future mortality and long term care insurance claim activity including change in policyholder behavior policyholder willingness to enter long term care facility or seek care at home among others these monitoring activity also allow to evaluate opportunity to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the result of our run off insurance operation such opportunity may include the pursuit of future premium rate increase and benefit reduction on long term care insurance contract in accordance with our reinsurance contract with our ceding company recapture and reinsurance transaction to reduce risk where economically justified investment strategy to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yield and managing our expense level key portfolio characteristicslong term care insurance contract the long term care insurance contract we reinsure provide coverage at varying level of benefit to policyholder and may include attribute that could result in claimant being on claim for longer period or at higher daily claim cost or alternatively limiting the premium paying period compared to contract with lower level of benefit for example policyholder with lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum long the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered service inflation protection option increase the daily maximum to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some option providing automatic annual increase of to or policyholder elected inflation indexed increase for increased premium joint life policy provide coverage for two life which permit either life under single contract to receive benefit at the same time or separately and premium payment option may limit the period over which the policyholder pay premium while still receiving coverage after premium payment cease which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increase the erac long term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two third of our total long term care insurance reserve and is assumed from approximately ceding company through various type of reinsurance and retrocession contract complex term and condition compared to the overall long term care insurance block it ha lower average attained age with larger number of policy and covered life over one third of the policy are joint life policy with lifetime benefit period and or with inflation protection option which may result in higher potential for future claim the uflic long term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long term care insurance reserve and is more mature with policy that are more uniform it is assumed from single ceding company genworth and ha fewer policy with lifetime benefit period no joint life policy and slightly more policy with inflation protection option further described within the premium deficiency testing section below we reconstructed our future claim cost projection in utilizing trend observed in our emerging experience for older claimant age and later duration policy also described within that section are key assumption change in ge form presented in the table

statutory increase in reserve of approximately billion through under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in note structured settlement annuity and life insurance contract we reinsure approximately structured settlement annuity with an average attained age of these structured settlement annuity were primarily underwritten on impaired life shorter than average life expectancy at origination and have projected payment extending decade into the future our primary risk associated with these contract include mortality life expectancy or longevity mortality improvement assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time which may extend the duration of payment on life contingent contract beyond our estimate and reinvestment risk low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margin unlike long term care insurance structured settlement annuity offer no ability to require additional premium or reduce benefit our life reinsurance business typically cover the mortality risk associated with various type of life insurance policy that we reinsure from approximately ceding company relationship where we pay benefit based on the death of covered life of december across our and canadian life insurance block we reinsure approximately billion of net amount at risk difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value from approximately million policy with an average attained age of in our incurred claim were approximately billion with an average individual claim of approximately the largest product type covered are year level term policy which represent approximately of the net amount at risk and significant portion are anticipated to lapse the length of time policy will remain in force over the next year the policy reach the end of their year level premium period investment portfolio and other adjustment our insurance liability and annuity benefit are primarily supported by investment security of billion and billion and commercial mortgage loan of billion and billion at december and respectively additionally we expect to purchase approximately billion of new asset through in conjunction with expected capital contribution from ge capital to our insurance subsidiary of which approximately billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of pending completion of our december statutory reporting process which includes asset adequacy testing our investment security are classified available for sale and comprise mainly investment grade debt security the portfolio includes billion of net unrealized gain that are recorded within other comprehensive income net of applicable tax and other adjustment of december in calculating our future policy benefit reserve we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gain and loss on our available for sale investment security supporting our insurance contract if those unrealized amount were realized to the extent that the realization of gain would result in premium deficiency an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserve with an after tax offset to other comprehensive income at december the entire billion balance of net unrealized gain on our investment security required related increase to future policy benefit reserve this adjustment increased from billion in to billion in primarily from higher unrealized gain within the investment security portfolio supporting our insurance contract result of decreased market yield see note for further information about our investment security ge form we manage the investment in our run off insurance operation under strict investment guideline including limitation on asset class concentration single issuer exposure asset liability duration variance and other factor to meet credit quality yield liquidity and diversification requirement associated with servicing our insurance liability under reasonable circumstance this process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategy and incorporates information from several external investment advisor to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liability when due well considering our risk based capital requirement regulatory constraint and tolerance for surplus volatility with the expected capital contribution from ge capital through we intend to add new asset class to further diversify our portfolio including private equity senior secured loan and infrastructure debt among others asset allocation planning is dynamic process that considers change in market condition risk appetite liquidity need and other factor which are reviewed on periodic basis by our investment team investing in these asset expose to both credit risk debtor ability to make timely payment of principal and interest and interest rate risk market price cash flow variability and reinvestment risk due to change in market interest rate we regularly review investment security for impairment using both quantitative and qualitative criterion our run off insurance operation have approximately billion of asset held by state or other regulatory body in statutorily required deposit account and approximately billion of asset held in trust account associated with reinsurance contract and reinsurance security trust agreement in place between either erac or uflic the reinsuring entity and number of ceding insurer asset in these trust are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer and are subject to various investment guideline set forth in the respective reinsurance contact and trust agreement some of these trust agreement may allow ceding company to withdraw trust asset from the trust and hold these asset on it balance sheet in an account under it control for the benefit of erac or uflic which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such asset critical accounting estimate our insurance reserve include the following key accounting estimate and assumption described below future policy benefit reserve future policy benefit reserve represent the present value of future policy benefit le the present value of future gross premium based on actuarial assumption including but not limited to morbidity frequency and severity of claim including claim termination rate and benefit utilization rate morbidity improvement assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future mortality life expectancy or longevity mortality improvement assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time policyholder persistency or lapse the length of time policy will remain in force anticipated premium increase or benefit reduction associated with future in force rate action including action that are approved and not yet implemented filed but not yet approved and estimated on future filing through on long term care insurance policy and interest rate assumption are locked in throughout the remaining life of contract unless premium deficiency develops claim reserve claim reserve are established when claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligation for future claim payment and claim adjustment expense key input include actual known fact about the claim such the benefit available and cause of disability of the claimant well assumption derived from our actual historical experience and expected future change in experience factor claim reserve are evaluated periodically for potential change in loss estimate with the support of qualified actuary and any change are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined reinsurance recoverables we cede insurance risk to third party reinsurers for portion of our insurance contract primarily on long term care insurance policy and record receivables for estimated recovery we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholder or cedents these receivables are estimated in manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve reserve ceded to reinsurers net of allowance were billion and billion at december and respectively and are included in the caption other ge capital receivables in our consolidated statement of financial position premium deficiency testing we annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run off insurance portfolio the premium deficiency testing ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reserve net of unamortized capitalized acquisition cost using current assumption without provision for adverse deviation comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumption is complex process and depends on number of factor many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product the vast majority of our run off insurance operation consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entity pursuant to treaty having complex term and condition premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entity and considers the reinsurance treaty and underlying policy in order to utilize that information for purpose of completing experience study covering all key assumption we perform detailed procedure to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entity our long term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained age is still emerging and to the extent future experience deviate from current expectation new projection of claim cost extending over the expected life of the policy may be required significant uncertainty exist in making projection for these long term care insurance contract which requires that we consider wide range of possible outcome ge form the primary assumption used in the premium deficiency test include morbidity morbidity assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on estimate of expected incidence of disability among policyholder and the cost associated with these policyholder asserting claim under their contract and these estimate account for any expected future morbidity improvement for long term care exposure estimating expected future cost includes assessment of incidence probability of claim utilization amount of available benefit expected to be incurred and continuance how long the claim will last prior to premium deficiency assumption considered the risk of anti selection by including issue age adjustment to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long term care policy issued to younger individual would exhibit lower expected incidence and claim cost than those issued to older policyholder recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curve indicated issue age difference had minimal impact on claim cost projection and accordingly beginning in issue age adjustment were eliminated in developing morbidity assumption higher morbidity increase while lower morbidity decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment rate of change in morbidity our annual premium deficiency testing incorporates our best estimate of projected future change in the morbidity rate reflected in our base claim cost curve these estimate draw upon number of input some of which are subjective and all of which are interpreted and applied in the exercise of professional actuarial judgment in the context of the characteristic specific to our portfolio this exercise of judgment considers factor such the work performed by internal and external independent actuarial expert engaged to advise in our annual testing the observed actual experience in our portfolio measured against our base projection industry development and other trend including advance in the state of medical care and health care technology development with respect to industry development we take into account that there are difference between and among industry peer in portfolio characteristic such demographic feature of the insured population the aggregate effect of morbidity improvement or deterioration applied to base claim cost projection the extent to which such base cost projection reflect the most current experience and the accepted diversity of practice in actuarial professional judgment we ass the potential for any change in morbidity with reference to our existing base claim cost projection reconstructed in projected improvement or deterioration in morbidity can have material impact on our future claim cost projection both on stand alone basis and also by virtue of influencing other variable such discount rate and premium rate increase mortality mortality assumption used in estimating future policy benefit reserve are based on published mortality table adjusted for the result of our experience study and estimate of expected future mortality improvement for life insurance product higher mortality increase the present value of expected future benefit payment while for annuity and long term care insurance contract higher mortality decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment discount rate interest rate assumption used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserve are based on expected investment yield net of related investment expense and expected default in estimating future investment yield we consider the actual yield on our current investment security held by our run off insurance operation and the future rate at which we expect to reinvest any proceeds from investment security maturity net of other operating cash flow and the projected future capital contribution into our run off insurance operation lower future investment yield result in lower discount rate and higher present value of future policy benefit reserve future long term care premium rate increase long term care insurance policy allow the issuing insurance entity to increase premium or alternatively allow the policyholder the option to decrease benefit with approval by state regulator should actual experience emerge worse than wa projected when such policy were initially underwritten reinsurer we rely upon the primary insurer that issued the underlying policy to file proposed premium rate increase on those policy with the relevant state insurance regulator while we have no direct ability to seek or to institute such premium rate increase we often collaborate with the primary insurer in accordance with reinsurance contractual term to file proposed premium rate increase the amount of time that rate increase have occurred varies by ceding company we consider recent experience of rate increase filing made by our ceding company along with state insurance regulatory process and precedent in establishing our current expectation higher future premium rate increase lower the present value of future policy benefit reserve and lower future premium rate increase increase the present value of future policy benefit reserve termination termination refers to the rate at which the underlying policy are cancelled due to either mortality lapse non payment of premium by policyholder or in the case of long term care insurance benefit exhaustion termination rate assumption used in estimating the present value of future policy benefit reserve are based on the result of our experience study and reflect actuarial judgment lower termination rate increase while higher termination rate decrease the present value of expected future benefit payment in based on elevated claim experience for portion of our long term care insurance contract we initiated comprehensive review of all premium deficiency testing assumption across all insurance product resulting in reconstruction of our future claim cost projection for long term care insurance product while our long term care insurance claim experience ha shown some emerging modest favorable experience it remains largely in line with those reconstructed projection however the extent of actual experience since to date is limited in the context of long tailed multi decade portfolio ge form premium deficiency testing we completed our annual premium deficiency testing in the aggregate across our run off insurance portfolio in the third quarter of these procedure included updating experience study since our last test completed in the third quarter of independent actuarial analysis and review of industry benchmark we experienced premium deficiency in our premium deficiency testing started with zero margin and accordingly any net adverse development would result in future premium deficiency using our most recent future policy benefit reserve assumption including change to our assumption related to morbidity future premium rate increase and discount rate the premium deficiency testing result indicated there wa positive margin of le than of the recorded future policy benefit reserve excluding other adjustment at september result the assumption updated in connection with the premium deficiency recognized in remain locked in and will remain so unless another premium deficiency occurs in the future the increase in the premium deficiency testing margin from our testing wa primarily attributable to modestly favorable emerging morbidity experience in our long term care insurance portfolio primarily at the older attained age in the period since the reconstruction of our future claim cost projection billion and higher projected future premium rate increase approval billion partially offset by decline in the overall discount rate to weighted average rate of compared to in billion this decline in the discount rate from to reflects lower expected reinvestment rate due to lower benchmark interest rate in the increasing to lower expected long term average investment yield over longer period and slightly lower actual yield on our investment security portfolio partially offset by increased allocation to higher yielding asset class introduced with our strategic initiative which included modest decline in expected yield compared to assumption noted above while our observed long term care insurance claim experience ha shown some emerging modest favorable experience in the period since the reconstruction of our future claim cost projection it remains largely in line with those reconstructed projection based on the application of professional actuarial judgment to the factor discussed above we have made no substantial change to our assumption concerning morbidity improvement mortality mortality improvement or termination in with all assumption underlying our premium deficiency testing we will continue to monitor these factor which may result in future change in our assumption since our premium deficiency testing performed in we have implemented approximately billion of previously approved long term care insurance premium rate increase action and expect higher projected future premium rate increase approval of approximately billion our premium deficiency test includes approximately billion of anticipated future premium increase or benefit reduction associated with future in force rate action this represents decrease of billion from our premium deficiency test to account for action that are approved and not yet implemented filed but not yet approved and estimated on future filing through and includes the effect of the lower discount rate mentioned above and longer anticipated timing to achieve certain premium rate approval result of exposure period cut off date to permit experience to develop and lag in ceding company data reporting from our ceding company the impact of covid is not reflected in the experience study data used in our premium deficiency testing however we assessed certain scenario to understand potential impact associated with covid and due to the insignificance and short term nature of such uncertain future impact including the natural offset from mortality in the aggregate across our run off insurance product concluded adjustment to our primary assumption used in the premium deficiency testing were not warranted when result of the premium deficiency testing indicate overall reserve are sufficient we are also required to ass whether additional future policy benefit reserve are required to be accrued over time in the future such an accrual would be required if profit are projected in earlier future period followed by loss projected in later future year profit followed by loss when this pattern of profit followed by loss is projected we would be required to accrue liability in the expected profitable year by the amount necessary to offset projected loss in later future year we noted our projection of third quarter indicate the present value of projected earnings in each future year to be positive and therefore no further adjustment to our future policy benefit reserve were required at this time gaap reserve sensitivity the result of our premium deficiency testing are sensitive to the assumption described above considering the result of the premium deficiency test which resulted in small margin any future net adverse change in our assumption may reduce the margin or result in premium deficiency requiring an increase to future policy benefit reserve for example adverse change in key assumption related to our future policy benefit reserve holding all other assumption constant would have the following effect on the projected present value of future cash flow presented in the table below any future net favorable change to these assumption could result in lower projected present value of future cash flow and additional margin in our premium deficiency test and higher income over the remaining duration of the portfolio including higher investment income the assumption within our future policy benefit reserve are subject to significant uncertainty including those inherent in the complex nature of our reinsurance treaty many of our assumption are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance product small change in the amount used in the sensitivity or the use of different factor could result in materially different outcome from those reflected below ge form assumptionhypothetical change in assumptionestimated increase to

financial statement in accordance with statutory accounting practice statutory accounting practice not gaap determine the required statutory capital level of our insurance legal entity statutory accounting practice are set forth by the national association of insurance commissioner naic well state law regulation and general administrative rule and differ in certain respect from gaap under statutory accounting practice base formulaic reserve assumption typically do not change unless approved by our primary regulator kid in addition to base reserve statutory accounting practice require additional actuarial reserve aar be established based on result of asset adequacy testing reflecting moderately adverse condition assumption include provision for adverse deviation pad rather than current assumption without pad required for premium deficiency testing under gaap result our statutory asset adequacy testing assumption reflect le long term care insurance morbidity improvement and for shorter duration restriction on future long term care insurance premium rate increase no life insurance mortality improvement and lower discount rate among other difference result several of the sensitivity described in the table above would be le impactful on our statutory reserve the adverse impact on our statutory aar arising from our revised assumption in including the collectability of reinsurance recoverables is expected to require ge capital to contribute approximately billion additional capital to it run off insurance operation in for statutory accounting purpose kid approved our request for permitted accounting practice to recognize the aar increase over seven year period ge capital provided capital contribution to it insurance subsidiary of billion billion and billion in the first quarter of and respectively ge capital expects to provide further capital contribution of approximately billion through of which approximately billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of pending completion of our december statutory reporting process which includes asset adequacy testing subject to ongoing monitoring by kid ge is party to capital maintenance agreement with erac and uflic under which ge is required to maintain their minimum statutory capital level at of their year end authorized control level risk based capital requirement defined from time to time by the naic ge form if our future policy benefit reserve established under gaap are realized over the estimated remaining life of our run off insurance obligation we would expect the billion of capital contributed to the run off insurance operation over the to period to be considered statutory capital surplus at the end of the estimated remaining life with no additional charge to gaap earnings however should the more conservative statutory assumption be realized we would be required to record the difference between gaap assumption and statutory assumption charge to gaap earnings in the future period see other item new accounting standard and note and for further information new accounting standard the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu no financial service insurance topic targeted improvement to the accounting for long duration contract with an effective date for period beginning after december with an election to adopt early on november the fasb issued asu financial service insurance topic effective date and early application which defers the effective date for all insurance entity by one year and allows the early application transition date to be either the beginning of the prior period or the earliest prior period presented we are evaluating the effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statement and anticipate that it adoption will significantly change the accounting for measurement of our long duration insurance liability the asu requires cash flow assumption used in the measurement of various insurance liability to be reviewed at least annually and updated if actual experience or other evidence indicates previous assumption need to be revised with any required change recorded in earnings under the current accounting guidance the discount rate is based on expected investment yield while under the asu the discount rate will be equivalent to the upper medium grade single fixed income instrument yield reflecting the duration characteristic of the liability and is required to be updated in each reporting period with change recorded in other comprehensive income in measuring the insurance liability under the new standard contract shall not be grouped together from different issue year these change result in the elimination of premium deficiency testing and shadow adjustment while we continue to evaluate the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting we anticipate that the adoption of the asu will materially affect our financial statement the asu is only applicable to the measurement of our long duration insurance liability under gaap it will not affect the accounting for our insurance reserve or the level of capital and surplus under statutory accounting practice non

in this form report or elsewhere the risk described below should not be considered complete list of potential risk that we face and additional risk not currently known to or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact the following information should be read in conjunction with the md section and the consolidated financial statement and related note the risk we describe in this form report or in our other sec filing could in way we may not be able to accurately predict recognize or control have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position result of operation cash flow and stock price and they could cause our future result to be materially different than we presently anticipate strategic risk strategic risk relates to the company future business plan and strategy including the risk associated with the global macro environment competitive threat the demand for our product and service and the success of our investment in technology and innovation our portfolio of business and capital allocation decision disposition acquisition joint venture and restructuring activity intellectual property and other risk covid the global covid pandemic ha had and is expected to continue to have material adverse impact on our operation and financial performance well on the operation and financial performance of many of the customer and supplier in industry that we serve our operation and financial performance have been negatively impacted by the covid pandemic that ha caused and is expected to continue to cause the global slowdown of economic activity including the decrease in demand for broad variety of good and service disruption in global supply chain and significant volatility and disruption of financial market across all of our business we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenge from the need to protect employee health and safety site shutdown workplace disruption and restriction on the movement of people raw material and good both at our own facility and at those of our customer and supplier we also have experienced and expect to continue experiencing lower demand and volume for product and service particularly at ge aviation described below and also for portion of ge healthcare business customer request for potential payment deferral or other contract modification supply chain under liquidation delay of delivery and the achievement of other billing milestone delay or cancellation of new project and related down payment and other factor related directly and indirectly to the covid pandemic that adversely impact our business in particular the interruption of regional and international air travel from covid is having material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customer the viability of their business and their demand for our service and product in this context we have observed significant increase in the number of request for payment deferral contract modification aircraft lease restructurings and similar action across the aviation sector which may lead to additional charge impairment and other adverse financial impact or to customer dispute at ge aviation and ge capital aviation service disruption of the aviation industry which could continue for an uncertain period of time is particularly significant for ge we have depended on the strength of our aviation business we have been working to improve the operation and execution of other ge business and strengthen the company balance sheet result disruption of the aviation industry which could continue for an uncertain period of time is particularly significant for ge the ultimate impact of the covid pandemic on our operation and financial performance depends on many factor that are not within our control including but not limited to the severity and duration of the pandemic including the impact of coronavirus mutation and resurgence governmental business and individual action that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic including restriction on travel and transport and workforce pressure the impact of the pandemic and action taken in response on global and regional economy travel and economic activity the development availability and public acceptance of effective treatment or vaccine the availability of federal state local or non funding program general economic uncertainty in key global market and financial market volatility global economic condition and level of economic growth and the pace and extent of recovery when the covid pandemic subsides number of accounting estimate that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the covid pandemic and uncertainty related to these and other factor and our accounting estimate and assumption may change over time in response to covid see note the covid pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial result it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factor described below ge form global macro environment our growth is subject to global economic political and geopolitical risk we operate in virtually every part of the world serve customer in over country and received of our revenue for from outside the united state our operation and the execution of our business plan and strategy are subject to the effect of global economic trend geopolitical risk and demand or supply shock from event that could include war major terrorist attack natural disaster or actual or threatened health emergency such covid they are also affected by local and regional economic environment and policy in the and other market that we serve including interest rate monetary policy inflation economic growth recession commodity price currency volatility currency control or other limitation on the ability to expatriate cash sovereign debt level and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt for example change in local economic condition or outlook such lower rate of investment or economic growth in china europe or other key market affect the demand for or profitability of our product and service outside the and the impact on the company could be significant given the extent of our activity outside the united state political change and trend such populism protectionism economic nationalism and sentiment toward multinational company and resulting tariff export control or other trade barrier or change to tax or other law and policy have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business and these can interfere with our global operating model supply chain production cost customer relationship and competitive position further escalation of specific trade tension such those between the and china or in global trade conflict more broadly could be harmful to global economic growth and related decrease in confidence or investment activity in the global market would adversely affect our business performance we also do business in many emerging market jurisdiction where economic political and legal risk are heightened industry dynamic and outlook the strategic priority and financial performance of our business are subject to major trend in our industry such decarbonization and digitization and we may not appropriately plan for or adapt quickly enough to dynamic that in some case can take many year to play out our long term operating result and competitive position depend substantially upon our ability to continually develop introduce and market new and innovative technology product service and platform to modify existing product and service to customize product and service to maintain long term customer relationship and to increase our productivity over time we perform on long term service agreement failure to appropriately plan for future customer demand and industry trend may adversely affect our delivery of product service and outcome in line with our projected financial performance or cost estimate and ultimately may result in excess cost build up of inventory that becomes obsolete lower profit margin and an erosion of our competitive position in some case major disruptive dynamic can arise quickly in our industry such the impact of the covid pandemic on air travel and the outlook for return to flight at pre pandemic level described above in other case we must anticipate and respond to market and technological change driven by broader trend such decarbonization effort in response to climate change or increased digitization in healthcare or other industry we serve or growth in industrial automation that present both risk and opportunity for our business for example the significant decrease in recent year in the levelized cost of energy for renewable source of power generation such wind and solar along with ongoing change in government investor customer and consumer policy commitment preference and consideration related to climate change in some case have adversely affected and are expected to continue to affect the demand for and the competitiveness of product and service related to fossil fuel based power generation including sale of new gas turbine and the utilization and servicing need for existing gas power plant continued shift toward greater penetration by renewables in both new capacity addition and the proportionate share of power generation particularly depending on the pace and timeframe for such shift across different market globally could have material adverse effect on the performance of our power business and our consolidated result while the anticipated market growth and generation share for renewable energy over time is favorable for our wind business there we face uncertainty related to the future anticipated level of government subsidy and credit significant price competition among wind equipment manufacturer dynamic between onshore and offshore wind power potential further consolidation in the wind industry and competition with other source of renewable energy such solar in addition the achievement of deep decarbonization goal over the coming decade is likely to depend in part on technology that are not yet deployed or widely adopted today but may become more important over time such grid scale battery or other storage solution hydrogen based power generation carbon capture and sequestration or advanced nuclear power and we may not adequately position our business to benefit from the growth in adoption of these technology these trend related to the global energy transition and decarbonization including the relative competitiveness of different type of product and service offering within and across our energy business well for ge aviation will continue to be impacted in way that are uncertain by factor such the pace of technological development and related cost consideration the level of economic growth in different market around the world and the adoption of climate change related policy such carbon tax cap and trade regime increased efficiency standard greenhouse gas emission reduction commitment incentive or mandate for particular type of energy or policy that impact the availability of financing for certain type of project at the national and sub national level or by private actor ge form competitive environment we are dependent on the maintenance of existing product line and service relationship market acceptance of new product and service introduction and technology and innovation leadership for revenue and earnings growth the market in which we operate are highly competitive in term of pricing product and service quality product development and introduction time customer service financing term and shift in market demand and competitor are increasingly offering service for our installed base our business are also subject to technological change and require to continually attract and retain skilled talent the introduction of innovative and disruptive technology in the market in which we operate also pose risk in the form of new competitor including new entrant from outside our traditional industry such competitor from digital technology company market consolidation substitution of existing product service or solution niche player new business model and competitor that are faster to market with new or more cost effective product or service because the research and development cycle involved in bringing product in our business to market is often lengthy it is inherently difficult to predict the economic condition and competitive dynamic that will exist when any new product is complete and our investment to the extent they result in bringing product to market may generate weaker return than we anticipated at the outset our capacity to invest in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service also depends on the financial resource that we have available for such investment relative to other capital allocation priority and to the extent there may be under investment that could lead to loss of sale of our product and service in the future particularly in our long cycle business the amount that we do invest in research and development divert resource from other potential investment in our business and our effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering restructuring retention we have been undertaking extensive cost reduction and restructuring effort these effort may have adverse effect on our operation employee retention result and reputation and may not achieve the expected benefit we continue undertaking restructuring action that include workforce reduction global facility consolidation and other cost reduction initiative these action have been central component of our ongoing effort to improve operational and financial performance and we have also taken additional action or accelerated the pace of action to mitigate the adverse financial effect of covid on our business the extent of change across our organizational structure senior leadership culture functional alignment outsourcing and other area pose risk in the form of personnel capacity constraint and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial target loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation the risk of capacity constraint is also heightened with the number of interdependent and transformational business portfolio and internal action that we have been undertaking during period of significant restructuring and cost reduction across the company moreover if we do not successfully manage our restructuring and other transformational activity the anticipated operational improvement efficiency and other benefit might be delayed or not realized and our operation and business could be disrupted risk associated with these action include unforeseen delay in implementation of workforce reduction additional unexpected cost adverse effect on employee morale loss of key employee or other retention issue inability to attract and hire talented professional or the failure to meet operational target due to the loss of employee or work stoppage any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reduction or may otherwise harm our business or reputation and have an adverse effect on our competitive position or financial performance business portfolio our success depends on achieving our strategic and financial objective including through disposition acquisition integration and joint venture over the past several year we have been pursuing variety of disposition including the ongoing monetization of our remaining equity ownership position in baker hughes the proceeds from those disposition have been an important source of cash flow for the company part of our strategic and financial planning when we seek to sell certain business equity interest or asset we may encounter difficulty in finding buyer or in market condition that could delay or prevent the accomplishment of our objective and decline in the value of equity interest such our remaining interest in baker hughes or other asset that we sell can diminish the cash proceeds that we realize we may dispose of business or asset at price or on term that are le favorable than we had anticipated or with purchase price adjustment or the exclusion of asset or liability that must be divested managed or run off separately we can also be subject to limitation in the form of regulatory or governmental approval that may prevent certain prospective counterparties from completing transaction with or delay from executing transaction on our preferred timeline or arising from our debt or other contractual obligation that limit our ability to complete certain transaction moreover disposition have the effect of reducing the company cash flow and earnings capacity resulting in le diversified portfolio of business and increasing our dependency on remaining business for our financial result from ongoing operation disposition or other business separation also often involve continued financial involvement in the divested business such through continuing equity ownership retained asset or liability transition service agreement commercial agreement guarantee indemnity or other current or contingent financial obligation or liability under these arrangement performance by the divested business or other condition outside our control could materially affect our future financial result with respect to acquisition joint venture and business integration we may not achieve expected return and other benefit on timely basis or at all result of change in strategy or separation integration challenge related to personnel it system or other factor executing on all type of portfolio transaction can divert senior management time and resource from other pursuit in addition in connection with acquisition over time we have recorded significant goodwill and other intangible asset on our balance sheet and if we are not able to realize the value of these asset we may be required to incur charge relating to the impairment of these asset we also participate in number of joint venture with other company or government enterprise in various market around the world including joint venture where we have lesser degree of control over the business operation which may expose to additional operational financial reputational legal or compliance risk ge form intellectual property our intellectual property portfolio may not prevent competitor from independently developing product and service similar to or duplicative to and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted by external dependency our patent and other intellectual property may not prevent competitor from independently developing or selling product and service similar to or duplicative of ours and there can be no assurance that the resource invested by to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology trademark license of the ge brand in connection with disposition may negatively impact the overall value of the brand in the future we also face competition in some country where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio if we are not able to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we also face attempt to gain unauthorized access to our it system or product for the purpose of improperly acquiring our trade secret or confidential business information the theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secret and other confidential business information result of such an incident could adversely affect our competitive position and the value of our investment in research and development in addition we are subject to the enforcement of patent or other intellectual property by third party including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claim by non practicing entity regardless of the merit of such claim responding to infringement claim can be expensive and time consuming if ge is found to infringe any third party right we could be required to pay substantial damage or we could be enjoined from offering some of our product and service the value of or our ability to use our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependency on third party such our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable term license that we need in the future or our ability to secure or retain ownership or right to use data in certain software analytics or service offering operational risk operational risk relates to risk arising from system process people and external event that affect the operation of our business it includes risk related to product and service lifecycle and execution product safety and performance information management and data protection and security including cybersecurity and supply chain and business disruption operational execution operational challenge could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position result of operation and cash flow the company financial result depend on the successful execution of our business operating plan across all step of the product and service lifecycle we continue working to improve the operation and execution of our business and our ability to effect the desired improvement will be significant factor in determining the financial performance of the company whole for example new product introduction remain important to onshore and offshore wind customer and in that environment the renewable energy business will need to continue to prioritize product quality delivery and other aspect of it operational execution new technology of larger turbine is introduced including the haliade offshore wind turbine operational failure at any of our business that result in quality problem or potential product environmental health or safety risk could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation in addition portion of our business particularly within our power and renewable energy business involves large project where we take on or are member of consortium responsible for the full scope of engineering procurement construction or other service these type of project often pose unique risk related to their location scale complexity duration and pricing or payment structure performance issue or schedule delay can arise due to inadequate technical expertise unanticipated project modification development at project site environmental health and safety issue execution by or coordination with supplier subcontractor or consortium partner financial difficulty of our customer or significant partner or compliance with government regulation and these can lead to cost overrun contractual penalty liquidated damage and other adverse consequence where ge is member of consortium we are typically subject to claim based on joint and several liability and claim can extend to aspect of the project or cost that are not directly related or limited to ge scope of work or over which ge doe not have control operational quality or other issue at large project or across our project portfolio more broadly can adversely affect ge business reputation or result of operation product safety our product and service are highly sophisticated and specialized and major failure or similar event affecting our product or third party product with which our product are integrated can adversely affect our business reputation financial position result of operation and cash flow we produce highly sophisticated product and provide specialized service for both our own and third party product that incorporate or use complex or leading edge technology including both hardware and software many of our product and service involve complex industrial machinery or infrastructure project such commercial jet engine gas turbine onshore and offshore wind turbine or nuclear power generation and accordingly the impact of catastrophic product failure or similar event could be significant in particular actual or perceived design or production issue related to new product introduction or relatively new product line can result in significant reputational harm to our business in addition to direct warranty maintenance and other cost that may arise significant product issue resulting in injury or death widespread outage fleet grounding or similar systemic consequence could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation we may also incur increased cost delayed payment or lost equipment or service revenue in connection with significant issue with third party product with which our product are integrated or if part or other component that we incorporate in our product have defect or other quality issue for example the leap engine that our aviation business develops produce and sell through cfm is the exclusive engine for the boeing max which wa subject to global fleet grounding for nearly two year until november following two fatal crash that were unrelated to the leap engine the pace and success of the max safe return to service and the corresponding leap engine production rate will have material significance to the result and outlook of our aviation business there can be no assurance that the operational process around product design manufacture performance and servicing that we or our customer or other third party have designed to meet rigorous quality standard will be sufficient to prevent or our customer or other third party from experiencing operational process or product failure and other problem including through manufacturing or design defect process or other failure of contractor or third party supplier cyber attack or other intentional act software vulnerability or malicious software that could result in potential product safety quality regulatory or environmental risk ge form cybersecurity increased cybersecurity requirement vulnerability threat and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose risk to our system network product solution service and data increased global cybersecurity vulnerability threat computer virus and more sophisticated and targeted cyber related attack well cybersecurity failure resulting from human error and technological error pose risk to the security of ge and it customer partner supplier and third party service provider infrastructure product system and network and the confidentiality availability and integrity of ge and it customer data the perpetrator of such attack become more capable including sophisticated state or state affiliated actor and critical infrastructure is increasingly becoming digitized the risk in this area continue to grow significant cyber related attack in one of our industry even if such an attack doe not involve ge product service or system could pose broader disruption and adversely affect our business for example we have observed an increase in third party breach at supplier service provider and software provider and our effort to mitigate adverse effect on ge if this trend continues may be le successful in the future the increasing degree of interconnectedness between ge and it partner supplier and customer also pose risk to the security of ge network well the larger ecosystem in which ge operates there can be no assurance that our attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risk by employing number of measure including employee training monitoring and testing performing security review and requiring business partner with connection to the ge network to appropriately secure their information technology system and maintenance of protective system and contingency plan will be sufficient to prevent detect and limit the impact of cyber related attack and we remain vulnerable to known or unknown threat in addition to existing risk the adoption of new technology in the future may also increase our exposure to cybersecurity breach and failure while we have developed secure development lifecycle design practice to secure our software design and connected product an unknown vulnerability or compromise could potentially impact the security of ge software or connected product lead to the loss of ge intellectual property safety risk or unavailability of equipment we also have access to sensitive confidential or personal data or information in certain of our business that is subject to privacy and security law regulation or customer imposed control despite our use of reasonable and appropriate control to protect our system and sensitive confidential or personal data or information we have vulnerability to security breach theft misplaced lost or corrupted data programming error employee error and or malfeasance including misappropriation by departing employee that could potentially lead to material compromising of sensitive confidential or personal data or information improper use of our system software solution or network unauthorized access use disclosure modification or destruction of or denial of access to information defective product production downtime and operational disruption data privacy and protection law are evolving can vary significantly by country and present increasing compliance challenge which increase our cost affect our competitiveness and can expose to substantial fine or other penalty in addition significant cyber related attack could result in other negative consequence including damage to our reputation or competitiveness remediation or increased protection cost litigation or regulatory action supply chain significant raw material shortage supplier capacity constraint supplier or customer production disruption supplier quality and sourcing issue or price increase can increase our operating cost and adversely impact the competitive position of our product our reliance on third party supplier contract manufacturer and service provider and commodity market to secure raw material part component and sub system used in our product expose to volatility in the price and availability of these material part component system and service our supply chain extend into many different country and region around the world we are also subject to global economic and geopolitical dynamic and risk associated with exporting component manufactured in particular country for incorporation into finished product completed in other country in addition some of our supplier or their sub supplier are limited or sole source supplier we also have internal dependency on certain key ge manufacturing or other facility disruption in delivery from key ge facility or from our third party supplier contract manufacturer or outsourced or other service provider capacity constraint production disruption up or down stream price increase or decreased availability of raw material or commodity including result of war natural disaster actual or threatened public health emergency or other business continuity event adversely affect our operation and depending on the length and severity of the disruption can limit our ability to meet our commitment to customer or significantly impact our operating profit or cash flow quality capability compliance and sourcing issue experienced by third party provider can also adversely affect our cost margin rate and the quality and effectiveness of our product and service and result in liability and reputational harm the harm to could be significant if for example quality issue at supplier or with component that we integrate into our product result in widespread quality issue across one of our product line or our fleet in addition while we require our supplier to implement and maintain reasonable and appropriate control to protect information we provide to them they may be the victim of cyber related attack that could lead to the compromise of the company intellectual property personal data or other confidential information or to production downtime and operational disruption that could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitment to customer an unknown security vulnerability or malicious software embedded in supplier product that is later integrated into ge product could lead to vulnerability in the security of ge product or if used internally in the ge network environment to compromise of the ge network which could potentially lead to the loss of information or operational disruption financial risk financial risk relates to our ability to meet financial obligation and mitigate exposure to broad market risk including funding and liquidity risk such risk related to our credit rating and our availability and cost of funding credit risk and volatility in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and commodity price liquidity risk refers to the potential inability to meet contractual or contingent financial obligation whether on or off balance sheet they arise and could potentially impact our financial condition or overall safety and soundness credit risk is the risk of financial loss arising from customer or counterparty failure to meet it contractual obligation and we face credit risk arising from both our industrial business and from ge capital ge form leverage borrowing our indebtedness level could limit the flexibility of our business and we could face further constraint result of failing to decrease our leverage over time further downgrade of our credit rating or adverse market condition our ability to decrease our leverage planned is dependent primarily on cash flow from operation well proceeds from disposition continuing to de lever and service our debt will require significant amount of cash and if we are unable to generate cash flow in accordance with our plan we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such increasing borrowing under credit line further reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling other business or asset refinancing debt or raising additional equity capital in addition we have significant pension and run off insurance liability that are sensitive to numerous factor and assumption that we use in our pension liability gaap insurance reserve and statutory insurance calculation for example the impact of low or declining market interest rate on the discount rate that we use to calculate these long term liability holding other variable constant can adversely affect our earnings and cash flow well the pace of progress toward our leverage goal for ge and for ge capital lower than expected cash generation by our business or disposition proceeds over time could also adversely affect our progress toward our leverage goal our indebtedness could put at competitive disadvantage compared to competitor with lower debt level that may have greater financial flexibility to secure additional funding for their operation pursue strategic acquisition finance long term project or take other action continuing to have substantial indebtedness could also increase our vulnerability to general economic condition such slowing economic growth or recession it could also increase our vulnerability to adverse industry specific condition or to increase in the capital or liquidity need at the ge or ge capital level and it could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in the economy and the industry in which we compete in addition our existing level of indebtedness may impair our ability to obtain additional debt financing on favorable term in the future particularly if coupled with further downgrade of our credit rating or deterioration of capital market condition more generally external condition in the financial and credit market such the increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity resulting from the covid pandemic may limit the availability of funding at particular time or increase the cost of funding which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation liquidity failure to meet our cash flow target or additional credit downgrade could adversely affect our liquidity funding cost and related margin we rely primarily on cash from operation well proceeds from business and asset disposition and access to the short and long term debt market to fund our operation maintain contingency buffer of liquidity and meet our financial obligation and capital allocation priority if we do not meet our cash flow objective through both improved cash performance in our business or successful execution of business and asset disposition our financial condition could be adversely affected our access to the debt market depends in part on our credit rating previously reported in april moody and changed their credit rating outlook for ge and ge capital from stable to negative and fitch lowered it credit rating for ge and ge capital there can be no assurance that we will not face additional credit downgrade result of factor such our continued progress in decreasing our leverage the performance of our business the failure to execute on disposition or change in rating application or methodology for ge or ge capital future downgrade could further adversely affect our cost of fund and related margin liquidity competitive position and access to capital market and significant downgrade could have an adverse commercial impact on our industrial business in addition swap forward and option contract are executed under standard master agreement that typically contain mutual downgrade provision that provide the ability of the counterparty to require termination if the credit rating of the applicable ge entity were to fall below specified rating level agreed upon with the counterparty for additional discussion about our current credit rating and related consideration refer to the capital resource and liquidity credit rating and condition section within md ge capital smaller ge capital continues to have exposure to insurance credit legal and other risk and in the event of future adverse development may not be able to meet it business and financial objective without further action at ge capital or additional capital contribution by ge compared to current plan to fund the statutory capital contribution that it expects to make to it insurance subsidiary over the next several year well to meet it debt maturity and other obligation ge capital expects to rely on it existing liquidity cash generated from asset sale and cash flow from it business well ge repayment of intercompany loan and capital contribution from ge however ge capital excess liquidity from past disposition proceeds run off and it future earnings are reduced result of business and asset sale there is risk that future adverse development could cause liquidity or funding stress for ge capital for example it is possible that future requirement for capital contribution to the insurance subsidiary will be greater than currently estimated or could be accelerated by regulator our annual testing of insurance reserve is subject to variety of assumption including assumption about the discount rate which is sensitive to change in market interest rate morbidity mortality and future long term care premium increase any future adverse change to these assumption to the extent not offset by any favorable change to these assumption could result in an increase to future policy benefit reserve and potentially to the amount of capital we are required to contribute to the insurance subsidiary discussed in the other item insurance section within md we also anticipate that the new insurance accounting standard scheduled to be effective after discussed in the other item new accounting standard section within md will significantly change the accounting for measurement of our long duration insurance liability under gaap and that the adoption of the accounting standard will materially affect our financial statement in addition we continue to evaluate strategic option to accelerate the further reduction in the size of ge capital some of these option could have material financial charge or other adverse effect depending on the timing negotiated term and condition of any ultimate arrangement it is also possible that contingent liability and loss estimate from ge capital continuing or discontinued operation such those related to bank bph see note will need to be recognized or increase in the future and will become payable if ge capital credit rating are downgraded because of inadequate increase in it capital level over time change in rating application or methodology for ge capital or other factor ge capital may also face increased interest cost and limitation on it ability to access external funding in the future there can be no assurance that future liability loss or impairment to the carrying value of financial asset would not materially and adversely affect ge capital business financial position result of operation and capacity to provide financing to support order from ge industrial business or that factor causing sufficiently severe stress at ge capital would not require ge to make larger than expected capital contribution to ge capital in the future ge form customer counterparties global economic industry specific or other development that weaken the soundness of significant customer government financial institution or other party we deal with can adversely affect our business result of operation and cash flow the business and operating result of our industrial business have been and will continue to be affected by worldwide economic condition including condition in the air transportation power generation renewable energy healthcare and other industry we serve existing or potential customer may delay or cancel plan to purchase our product and service including large infrastructure project and may not be able to fulfill their obligation to in timely fashion or at all result of business deterioration cash flow shortage or difficulty obtaining financing for particular project or due to macroeconomic condition geopolitical disruption change in law or other challenge affecting the strength of the global economy the airline industry for example is highly cyclical and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the and international economy aviation industry activity is also particularly influenced by small group of large original equipment manufacturer well large airline in various geography and our credit exposure to some of our largest aviation customer is significant described above the current extended disruption of regional and international air travel from the covid pandemic ha had and is expected to continue to have material adverse effect on our airframer and airline customer potential future disruption in connection with terrorist incident cyberattack actual or threatened public health emergency or recessionary economic environment that result in the loss of business and leisure traffic could also adversely affect these customer their ability to fulfill their obligation to in timely fashion or at all demand for our product and service and the viability of customer business secular cyclical or other pressure facing customer across our energy business including in connection with decarbonization industry consolidation and competition and shift in the availability of financing for certain type of project can also have significant impact on the operating result and outlook for our business operating in those industry ge capital also ha exposure to many different industry and counterparties including customer that are sovereign government or located in emerging market and routinely executes transaction with counterparties in the financial service industry including broker and dealer commercial bank investment bank insurance company and other institutional client many of these transaction expose ge capital and it subsidiary to credit and other risk in the event of insolvency or other default of it counterparty or client for example portion of ge capital run off insurance operation asset that are held in trust account associated with uflic reinsurance contract and reinsurance security trust agreement are currently held in trust for the benefit of insurance company subsidiary of genworth which in january announced that it would focus on contingency plan to meet it near term liability amidst uncertainty around the completion of it planned merger with china oceanwide solvency or other concern about genworth or it insurance company subsidiary may cause those subsidiary or their regulator to take or attempt to take action that could adversely affect uflic including control over asset in the relevant trust we also at time face greater challenge collecting on receivables with customer that are sovereign government or located in emerging market if there is significant deterioration in the global economy in our industry in financial market or with particular significant counterparties our result of operation financial position and cash flow could be materially adversely affected postretirement benefit plan increase in pension healthcare and life insurance benefit obligation and cost can adversely affect our earnings cash flow and progress toward our leverage goal our result of operation may be positively or negatively affected by the amount of income or expense we record for our defined benefit pension plan gaap requires that we calculate income or expense for the plan using actuarial valuation which reflect assumption about financial market interest rate and other economic condition such the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset we are also required to make an annual measurement of plan asset and liability which may result in significant reduction or increase to equity the factor that impact our pension calculation are subject to change in key economic indicator and future decrease in the discount rate or low return on plan asset can increase our funding obligation and adversely impact our financial result in addition although gaap expense and pension funding contribution are not directly related key economic factor that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plan under erisa failure to achieve expected return on plan asset driven by various factor which could include continued environment of low interest rate or sustained market volatility could also result in an increase to the amount of cash we would be required to contribute to pension plan in addition there may be upward pressure on the cost of providing healthcare benefit to current and future retiree and life insurance benefit to eligible retiree there can be no assurance that the measure we have taken to control increase in these cost will succeed in limiting cost increase and continued upward pressure could reduce our profitability for discussion regarding how our financial statement have been and can be affected by our pension and healthcare benefit obligation see note legal compliance risk legal and compliance risk relates to risk arising from the government and regulatory environment and action and from legal proceeding and compliance with integrity policy and procedure including those relating to financial reporting and environmental health and safety matter government and regulatory risk includes the risk that the government or regulatory action will impose additional cost on or require to make adverse change to our business model or practice ge form regulatory we are subject to wide variety of law regulation and government policy that may change in significant way our business are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state and non law regulation and policy there can be no assurance that law regulation and policy will not be changed or interpreted or enforced in way that will require to modify our business model and objective or affect our return on investment by restricting existing activity and product subjecting them to escalating cost or prohibiting them outright in particular recent trend globally toward increased protectionism import and export control and the use of tariff and other trade barrier can result in action by government around the world that have been and may continue to be disruptive and costly to our business and can interfere with our global operating model and weaken our competitive position other legislative and regulatory area of significance for our business that and non government have focused and continue to focus on include cybersecurity data privacy and sovereignty improper payment competition law compliance with complex economic sanction climate change and greenhouse gas emission foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility and currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction potential further change to tax law including change to taxation of global income may have an effect on ge ge capital or other regulated subsidiary structure operation sale liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for example legislative or regulatory measure by federal state or non government or rule interpretation or audit under the new or existing tax law could increase our cost or tax rate in addition effort by public and private sector to control healthcare cost may lead to lower reimbursement and increased utilization control related to the use of our product by healthcare provider regulation or government scrutiny may impact the requirement for marketing our product and slow our ability to introduce new product resulting in an adverse impact on our business furthermore we have been and expect to continue participating in and international governmental program which require to comply with strict governmental regulation inability to comply with these regulation could adversely affect our status in these project and could have collateral consequence such debarment debarment depending on the entity involved and length of time can limit our ability to participate in other project involving multilateral development bank and adversely affect our result of operation financial position and cash flow legal proceeding we are subject to legal proceeding dispute investigation and legal compliance risk including trailing liability from business that we dispose of or that are inactive we are subject to variety of legal proceeding commercial dispute legal compliance risk and environmental health and safety compliance risk in virtually every part of the world we our representative and the industry in which we operate are subject to continuing scrutiny by regulator other governmental authority and private sector entity or individual in the the european union china and other jurisdiction which have led or may in certain circumstance lead to enforcement action adverse change to our business practice fine and penalty required remedial action such contaminated site clean up or the assertion of private litigation claim and damage that could be material for example following our acquisition of alstom thermal renewables and grid business in we are subject to legacy legal proceeding and legal compliance risk that relate to claimed anti competitive conduct or improper payment by alstom in the pre acquisition period and payment for settlement judgment penalty or other liability in connection with those matter have resulted and will in the future result in cash outflow in addition while in december we entered into settlement to conclude the previously disclosed sec investigation of ge we remain subject to range of shareholder lawsuit related to the company financial performance accounting and disclosure practice and related legacy matter we have observed that these proceeding related to claim about past financial performance and reporting pose particular reputational risk for the company that can cause new allegation about past or current misconduct even if unfounded to have more significant impact on our reputation and how we are viewed by investor customer and others than they otherwise would we have established reserve for legal matter when and appropriate however the estimation of legal reserve or possible loss involves significant judgment and may not reflect the full range of uncertainty and unpredictable outcome inherent in litigation and investigation and the actual loss arising from particular matter may exceed our current estimate and adversely affect our result of operation there can be no assurance that the risk management and compliance program we have adopted will mitigate legal and compliance risk particularly in light of the global and diverse nature of our operation and the current enforcement environment we are also subject to material trailing legal liability from business that we dispose of or that are inactive we also expect that additional legal proceeding and other contingency will arise from time to time moreover we sell product and service in growth market where claim arising from alleged violation of law product failure or other incident involving our product and service are adjudicated within legal system that are le developed and le reliable than those of the or other more developed market and this can create additional uncertainty about the outcome of proceeding before court or other governmental body in such market see note for further information about legal proceeding and other loss contingency

which they relate evaluation of revenue recognition on certain long term service agreementsas discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement the company enters into long term service agreement with some of it customer certain long term service agreement require the company to provide maintenance service that may include level of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime throughout the contract period revenue for such long term service agreement is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred relative to total expected cost we identified the evaluation of revenue recognition on certain long term service agreement critical audit matter because of the complex auditor judgment required in evaluating some of the long term estimate in such arrangement such estimate include the amount of customer payment expected to be received over the contract term which are generally based on combination of both historical customer utilization of the covered asset well forward looking information such market condition in addition these estimate include the total cost expected to be incurred to perform required maintenance service over the contract term and include estimate of expected cost improvement when such cost improvement are supported by actual result or have been proven effective further contract modification that extend or revise contract term are not uncommon and require judgment in evaluating the related revision of the long term estimate the following are the primary procedure we performed to address this critical audit matter we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal control over the company revenue recognition process for long term service agreement including control related to estimating customer payment and cost expected to be incurred to perform required maintenance service over the contract term we evaluated the estimated customer payment by comparing the estimated customer utilization of the covered asset to historical utilization and industry utilization data specifically considering the information provided by the company airline customer about the current outlook in response to the covid pandemic for commercial air travel and after market service within the aviation segment where available we evaluated the estimated cost expected to be incurred to perform required maintenance service over the contract term by comparing estimated labor and part cost to historical labor and part cost comparing the estimated useful life which is referred to part life of certain component part to historical data and regulatory limit on part life where applicable inspecting evidence underlying the inclusion of cost improvement in estimated cost including regulatory and engineering approval and actual reduction in production cost to date and ascertaining if major overhaul of covered asset are included in the cost estimate on basis consistent with the estimated customer utilization of the asset that is used in estimating customer payment in addition we involved valuation professional with specialized skill and knowledge who assisted in testing certain cost estimate including assessing statistical model used by the company to estimate the part life of certain component part of the covered asset evaluation of premium deficiency testing to ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reservesas discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement the company performs premium deficiency testing to ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reserve this testing is performed on an annual basis or whenever event and change in circumstance indicate that premium deficiency event may have occurred significant uncertainty exist in testing cash flow projection in the premium deficiency testing for these insurance contract including consideration of wide range of possible outcome of future event over the life of the underlying contract that can extend for long period of time we identified the evaluation of premium deficiency testing to ass the adequacy of future policy benefit reserve critical audit matter specifically the evaluation of the following key assumption in the premium deficiency testing required subjective auditor judgment and specialized skill and knowledge long term care morbidity improvement and mortality improvement discount rate and long term care premium rate increase the following are the primary procedure we performed to address this critical audit matter we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal control over the company premium deficiency testing process including control to develop the key assumption described above in addition we involved actuarial professional with specialized skill and knowledge who assisted in assessing the company key assumption and result by evaluating the relevance reliability and consistency of the assumption with each other the underlying data relevant historical data and industry data assessing the summary experience data and the corresponding actuarial assumption for conformity with generally accepted actuarial principle performing recalculation to ass that the key assumption were reflected in the cash flow projection andge form comparing the current year and prior year cash flow projection to analyze the impact of the updated key assumption on the gross premium valuation used to ass the adequacy of the future policy benefit reserve we evaluated projected future long term premium rate increase by comparing the proposed attained denied and approved premium rate increase to underlying source documentation we also compared the current year premium rate increase projection to actual historical rate increase experience evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill in the additive and gecas reporting unitsas discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement the company performs goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of reporting unit might exceed it fair value the discount rate applied to projected cash flow and the selection of publicly traded company are important element used by the company in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the amount of related goodwill impairment loss in the second quarter of the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test in response to the decline in current market condition result of the covid pandemic the goodwill allocated to the additive reporting unit and the goodwill allocated to the ge capital aviation service gecas reporting unit were determined to be impaired and impairment loss of million and million were recorded respectively we identified the evaluation of the discount rate applied to projected cash flow used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for the additive reporting unit and the evaluation of publicly traded company used in the assessment of the carrying value of goodwill for the gecas reporting unit for which such assumption are used by the company in the determination of related goodwill impairment loss critical audit matter specifically the evaluation of these assumption required the application of subjective auditor judgment because change to these assumption may have substantial impact on the determination of fair value of each reporting unit we performed sensitivity analysis to determine the significance of the assumption used to determine the fair value of the additive and gecas reporting unit individually and in the aggregate which required higher degree of auditor judgment the following are the primary procedure we performed to address this critical audit matter we evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal control over the company goodwill impairment process including control over the company selection of the discount rate and the relevance of the publicly traded company selected by the company specialist in our evaluation of the additive reporting unit fair value we evaluated the company assessment of the value of the reporting unit under the discounted cash flow method we involved valuation professional with specialized skill and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate applied to projected cash flow selected by management by comparing the discount rate selected by management against discount rate that wa independently developed using publicly available market data for comparable entity in our evaluation of the gecas reporting unit fair value we involved valuation professional with specialized skill and knowledge who assisted in evaluating the company assessment of the value of the reporting unit under the market approach we evaluated the reasonableness of the market approach utilized and we evaluated the relevance of the publicly traded company utilized by comparing the publicly traded company selected in management analysis over the gecas reporting unit to similar company in the aircraft leasing industry and comparing management

further information effective december in order to enhance our financial statement presentation we voluntarily made the following reporting change for all period presented changed our presentation of ge industrial restructuring program cost previously these cost were recorded within corporate item and elimination now these cost are recorded within segment profit except for significant higher cost program that continue to be recorded within corporate item and elimination changed the presentation of our statement of financial position to reflect the classification of asset and liability into

previously reported in cost of good and service sold and ceased reporting ge capital an equity method investment within the ge industrial column this change ha no impact on the ge capital or consolidated column consistent with our historical practice all commercial transaction between ge industrial and ge capital continue to be reported on arm length term and are eliminated upon

estimate future economic and market condition which affect reported amount and related disclosure in our financial statement although our current estimate contemplate current and expected future condition applicable it is reasonably possible that actual condition could differ from our expectation which could materially affect our result of operation and financial position in particular number of estimate have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing coronavirus disease covid pandemic the severity magnitude and duration well the economic consequence of the covid pandemic are uncertain rapidly changing and difficult to predict result our accounting estimate and assumption may change over time in response to covid such change could result in future impairment of goodwill

whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical average of in transit period time between shipment and delivery where arrangement include customer acceptance provision based on seller or customer specified objective criterion we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer ha control of the good and that acceptance is likely to occur we do not provide for anticipated loss on point in time transaction prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer our billing term for these point in time equipment contract generally coincide with delivery to the customer however within certain business we receive progress collection from customer for large equipment purchase to generally reserve production slot revenue from the sale of service consistent with our management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation md discussion and the way we manage our business we refer to sale under service agreement which includes both good such spare part and equipment upgrade and related service such monitoring maintenance and repair sale of service which is an important part of our operation we sometimes offer our

service to cfm international based on arm length term ge capital revenue from service we recognize operating lease income on straight line basis over the term of underlying lease and we use the interest method to recognize income on loan and finance lease we stop accruing interest on loan at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes day past due estimated unguaranteed residual value for finance lease are based upon management best estimate of the value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term we use various source of data in determining these estimate including information obtained from third party which is adjusted for the attribute of the specific asset under lease guarantee of residual value by unrelated third party are included within minimum lease payment ge form for traditional long duration insurance contract we report premium revenue when due premium received on non traditional long duration insurance

investment security we report investment in available for sale debt security and certain equity security at fair value unrealized gain and loss on available for sale debt security are recorded to other comprehensive income net of applicable tax and adjustment related to our insurance liability unrealized gain and loss on equity security with readily determinable fair value are recorded to earnings although we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific debt security in the ordinary course of managing our portfolio we may sell debt security prior to their maturity for variety of reason including diversification credit quality yield and liquidity requirement and the funding of claim and obligation to policyholder we regularly review investment security for impairment for debt security if we do not intend to sell the security or it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of our amortized cost we evaluate qualitative criterion such the financial health of and specific prospect for the issuer to determine whether we do not expect to recover the amortized cost basis of the security we also evaluate quantitative criterion including determining whether there ha been an adverse change in expected future cash flow if we do not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security we consider the security to contain an expected credit loss and we record the difference between the security amortized cost basis and it recoverable amount in earnings an allowance for credit loss and the difference between the security recoverable amount and fair value in other comprehensive income if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of it amortized cost basis the security is considered impaired and we recognize the entire difference between the security amortized cost basis and it fair value in earnings see note for further information current receivables amount due from customer arising from the sale of product and service are recorded at the outstanding amount le allowance for loss we regularly monitor the recoverability of our receivables see note for further information allowance for credit loss when we record customer receivables contract asset and financing receivables arising from revenue transaction well commercial mortgage loan and reinsurance recoverables in ge capital run off insurance operation financial guarantee and certain commitment we record an allowance for credit loss for the current expected credit loss cecl inherent in the asset over it expected life the allowance for credit loss is valuation account deducted from the amortized cost basis of the asset to present their net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected each period the allowance for credit loss is adjusted through earnings to reflect expected credit loss over the remaining life of the asset we evaluate debt security with unrealized loss to determine whether any of the loss arise from concern about the issuer credit or the underlying collateral and record an allowance for credit loss if required we estimate expected credit loss based on relevant information about past event including historical experience current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the reported amount when measuring expected credit loss we pool asset with similar country risk and credit risk characteristic change in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimate of expected credit loss financing receivables our financing receivables portfolio consists of variety of loan and lease including both larger balance non homogeneous loan and lease and smaller balance homogeneous loan and lease we routinely evaluate our entire portfolio for potential specific credit or collection issue that might indicate an impairment see note for further information inventory all inventory are stated at lower of cost or realizable value cost of inventory is primarily determined on first in first out fifo basis see note for further information property plant and equipment the cost of ge industrial property plant and equipment is generally depreciated on straight line basis over it estimated economic life the cost of ge capital equipment leased to others on operating lease is depreciated on straight line basis to estimated residual value over the lease term or over the estimated economic life of the equipment see note for further information ge form lease accounting lessee arrangement at lease commencement we record lease liability and corresponding right of use rou asset option to extend the lease are included part of the rou lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the company will exercise the option we have elected to include lease and non lease component in determining our lease liability for all leased asset except our vehicle lease non lease component are generally service that the lessor performs for the company associated with the leased asset the present value of our lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception for lease with an initial term of month or le an rou asset and lease liability is not recognized and lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term we test rou asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired lessor arrangement equipment leased to others under operating lease are included in property plant and equipment and lease classified finance lease are included in financing receivables on our statement of financial position see note and for further information goodwill and other intangible asset we test goodwill at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it fair value when portion of reporting unit is disposed goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair value of the business or business disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained for other intangible asset that are not deemed indefinite lived cost is generally amortized on straight line basis over the asset estimated economic life except for individually significant customer related intangible asset that are amortized in relation to total related sale amortizable intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable in these circumstance they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flow and if impaired written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flow or appraised value see note for further information derivative and hedging we use derivative to manage variety of risk including risk related to interest rate foreign exchange certain equity investment and commodity price accounting for derivative hedge requires that at inception and over the term of the arrangement the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirement for hedge accounting in evaluating whether particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether change in the fair value of the derivative offset within specified range change in the fair value of the hedged item if fair value change fail this test we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation model incorporating market based assumption subject to third party confirmation applicable see note for further information deferred income tax deferred income tax balance reflect the effect of temporary difference between the carrying amount of asset and liability and their tax base well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and are stated at enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when those tax are paid or recovered deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy to the extent we consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will not be recovered valuation allowance is established deferred tax needed are provided for our investment in affiliate and associated company when we plan to remit those earnings see note for further information insurance liability and annuity benefit our run off insurance operation include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risk and providing certain annuity product primary product type include long term care structured settlement annuity life and disability insurance contract and investment contract insurance contract are contract with significant mortality and or morbidity risk while investment contract are contract without such risk liability for traditional long duration insurance contract include both future policy benefit reserve and claim reserve future policy benefit reserve represent the present value of future policy benefit le the present value of future gross premium based on actuarial assumption liability for investment contract equal the account value that is the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessment through the financial statement date claim reserve are established when claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represent our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligation for future claim payment and claim adjustment expense to the extent that unrealized gain on specific investment security supporting our insurance contract would result in premium deficiency should those gain be realized an increase in future policy benefit reserve is recorded with an offsetting after tax reduction to net unrealized gain recorded in other comprehensive income reinsurance recoverables are recorded when we cede insurance risk to third party but are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholder and cedents when loss on ceded risk give rise to claim for recovery we establish allowance for probable loss on such receivables from reinsurers required see note for further information ge form postretirement benefit plan we sponsor number of pension and retiree health and life insurance benefit plan that we present in three category principal pension plan other pension plan and principal retiree benefit plan we use december measurement date for these plan on our consolidated statement of financial position we measure our plan asset at fair value and the obligation at the present value of the estimated payment to plan participant participant earn benefit based on their service and pay those estimated future payment amount are determined based on assumption difference between our actual result and what we assumed are recorded in separate component of equity each period these difference are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active employee or the expected life of inactive participant applicable who participate in the plan see note for further information loss contingency loss contingency are uncertain and unresolved matter that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from event or action by others that have the potential to result in future loss such contingency include but are not limited to environmental obligation litigation regulatory investigation and proceeding product quality and loss resulting from other event and development when loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable we record liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss when there appears to be range of possible cost with equal likelihood liability are based on the low end of such range disclosure is provided for material loss contingency when loss is probable but reasonable estimate can not be made and when it is reasonably possible that loss will be incurred or the amount of loss will exceed the recorded provision we regularly review contingency to determine whether the likelihood of loss ha changed and to ass whether reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made see note for further information supply chain finance program we evaluate supply chain finance program to ensure where we use third party intermediary to settle our trade payable their involvement doe not change the nature existence amount or timing of our trade payable and doe not provide the company with any direct economic benefit if any characteristic of the trade payable change or we receive direct economic benefit we reclassify the trade payable borrowing fair value measurement the following section describe the valuation methodology we use to measure financial and non financial instrument accounted for at fair value including certain asset within our pension plan and retiree benefit plan observable input reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input reflect our market assumption these input establish fair value hierarchy level quoted price for identical instrument in active market level quoted price for similar instrument in active market quoted price for identical or similar instrument in market that are not active and model derived valuation whose input are observable or whose significant value driver are observable level significant input to the valuation model are unobservable recurring fair value measurement for financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis primarily investment security and derivative fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in the absence of active market for the identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data and in the absence of such data internal information that is consistent with what market participant would use in hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date see note for further information debt security when available we use quoted market price to determine the fair value of debt security which are included in level for our remaining debt security we obtain pricing information from an independent pricing vendor the input and assumption to the pricing vendor model are derived from market observable source including benchmark yield reported trade broker dealer quote issuer spread benchmark security bid offer and other market related data these investment are included in level our pricing vendor may also provide with valuation that are based on significant unobservable input and in those circumstance we classify the investment security in level annually we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to validate that the input used in that vendor pricing process are deemed to be market observable defined in the standard we believe that the price received from our pricing vendor are representative of price that would be received to sell the asset at the measurement date exit price and are classified appropriately in the hierarchy we use non binding broker quote and other third party pricing service our primary basis for valuation when there is limited or no relevant market activity for specific instrument or for other instrument that share similar characteristic debt security priced in this manner are included in level equity security with readily determinable fair value these publicly traded equity security are valued using quoted price and are included in level derivative the majority of our derivative are valued using internal model the model maximize the use of market observable input including interest rate curve and both forward and spot price for currency and commodity derivative asset and liability included in level primarily represent interest rate swap cross currency swap and foreign currency and commodity forward and option contract derivative asset and liability included in level primarily represent equity derivative and interest rate product that contain embedded optionality or prepayment feature ge form investment in private equity real estate and collective fund held within our pension plan these investment are generally valued using the net asset value nav per share practical expedient for fair value provided certain criterion are met the navs are determined based on the fair value of the underlying investment in the fund investment that are measured at fair value using the nav practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy see note for further information nonrecurring fair value measurement certain asset are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis these asset may include loan and long lived asset reduced to fair value upon classification held for sale impaired loan based on the fair value of the underlying collateral impaired equity security without readily determinable fair value equity method investment and long lived asset and remeasured retained investment in formerly consolidated subsidiary upon change in control that result in the deconsolidation of that subsidiary and retention of noncontrolling stake in the entity asset written down to fair value when impaired and retained investment are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs equity investment without readily determinable fair value and associated company equity investment without readily determinable fair value and associated company are valued using market observable data such transaction price when available when market observable data is unavailable investment are valued using either discounted cash flow model comparative market multiple third party pricing source or combination of these approach appropriate these investment are generally included in level long lived asset fair value of long lived asset including aircraft are primarily derived internally and are based on observed sale transaction for similar asset in other instance for which we do not have comparable observed sale transaction data collateral value are developed internally and corroborated by external appraisal information adjustment to third party valuation may be performed in circumstance where market comparables are not specific to the attribute of the specific collateral or appraisal information may not be reflective of current market condition due to the passage of time and the occurrence of market event since receipt of the information accounting change on january we adopted asu no financial instrument credit loss asu requires to prospectively record an allowance for credit loss for the current expected credit loss inherent in the asset over it expected life replacing the incurred loss model that recognized loss only when they became probable and estimable we recorded million increase in our allowance for credit loss and million decrease to retained earnings net of tax reflecting the cumulative effect on retained earnings on january we adopted asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the asu eliminates step of the goodwill impairment test and the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit with zero or negative carrying amount the asu also requires an entity to disclose the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit with zero or negative carrying amount the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statement in march the financial accounting standard board issued asu reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effect of reference rate reform on financial reporting on october we adopted the new standard which provides optional expedient and exception for applying generally accepted accounting principle to contract hedging relationship and other transaction affected by reference rate reform if certain criterion are met we will apply the accounting relief relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship modification are made during the reference rate reform transition period we do not expect the standard to have material impact on our consolidated financial statement note business held for sale and discontinued operation asset and liability of business held for sale on march we completed the sale of our biopharma business within

are accounted for on an actuarial basis which requires the selection of various assumption including discount rate an expected return on asset mortality rate of participant and expectation of mortality improvement projected benefit obligation are measured the present value of expected benefit payment we discount those cash payment using discount rate we determine the discount rate using the weighted average yield on high quality fixed income security with maturity that correspond to the payment of benefit lower discount rate increase present value and generally increase subsequent year pension expense higher discount rate decrease present value and generally reduce subsequent year pension expense ge form the compensation assumption is used to estimate the annual rate at which pay of plan participant will grow if the rate of growth assumed increase the size of the pension obligation will increase will the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci in our consolidated statement of financial position and amortized into earnings in subsequent period the expected return on plan asset is the estimated long term rate of return that will be earned on the investment used to fund the benefit obligation to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan asset we consider our asset allocation well historical and expected return on various category of plan asset in developing future long term return expectation for our principal benefit plan asset we formulate view on the future economic environment both in the and abroad we evaluate general market trend and historical relationship among number of key variable that impact asset class return such expected earnings growth inflation valuation yield and spread using both internal and external source we also take into account expected volatility by asset class and diversification across class to determine expected overall portfolio result given our asset allocation based on our analysis we have assumed long term expected return on our ge pension plan asset for cost recognition in compared to in and the society of actuary issued new mortality improvement table in and new mortality base and improvement table in we updated mortality assumption in the accordingly these change in assumption decreased the december and pension and retiree benefit plan obligation by million and million respectively the healthcare trend assumption apply to our pre retiree medical plan our post retiree plan ha fixed subsidy and therefore is not subject to healthcare inflation we evaluate these critical assumption at least annually on plan and country specific basis we periodically evaluate other assumption involving demographic factor such retirement age and turnover and update them to reflect our actual experience and expectation for the future actual result in any given year will often differ from actuarial assumption because of economic and other factor difference between our actual result and what we assumed are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income each period these difference are amortized into earnings over the remaining average future service of active participating employee or the expected life of inactive participant applicable sensitivity to key assumption fluctuation in discount rate can significantly impact pension cost and obligation basis point decrease in discount rate would increase principal pension plan cost in the following year by about million and would increase the principal pension projected benefit obligation at year end by about million the deficit sensitivity to the discount rate is lower than the projected benefit obligation sensitivity result of the liability hedging program incorporated in the plan asset

we believe we have defense to the claim and are responding accordingly bank bph previously reported ge capital subsidiary bank bph along with other polish bank ha been subject to ongoing litigation in poland related to it portfolio of floating rate residential mortgage loan with case brought by individual borrower seeking relief related to their foreign currency denominated mortgage loan in various court throughout poland at december approximately of the bank bph portfolio is indexed to or denominated in foreign currency primarily swiss franc and the total portfolio had carrying value of million we continue to observe an increase in the number of lawsuit being brought against bank bph and other bank in poland and this is likely to continue in future reporting period ge form we estimate potential loss for bank bph in connection with borrower litigation case that are pending by recording legal reserve well in connection with potential future case or other adverse development part of our ongoing valuation of the bank bph portfolio which we record at the lower of cost or fair value le cost to sell at december the total amount of such estimated loss wa million we have updated our assumption underlying this amount over time in response to the trend we have previously reported of there being an increase in the number of lawsuit filed more finding of liability and more severe remedy being ordered against polish bank including bank bph we also expect these trend to continue in future reporting period although bank bph is unable at this time to develop meaningful estimate of reasonably possible loss associated with active and inactive bank bph mortgage loan beyond the amount currently recorded these estimate involve significant judgment including assumption about the number of borrower that will file lawsuit whether liability will be established in lawsuit and the nature of the remedy that court will order if liability is established well the following factor uncertainty related to how polish court will interpret and apply prior judicial decision the pendency of potentially significant judicial decision that we anticipate will be issued in the first half of including decision by the european court of justice ecj on the case involving bank bph mortgage loan that wa referred to the ecj in january and one or more binding resolution from the polish supreme court uncertainty related to proposal by the chairman of the polish financial supervisory authority in december that bank voluntarily offer borrower an opportunity to convert their foreign currency denominated mortgage loan to polish zloty using an exchange rate applicable at the date of loan origination and about the approach that other polish bank will adopt in response to this proposal and uncertainty arising from decision of the polish office of competition and consumer protection uokik in december which found that certain foreign exchange clause that appear in certain of bank bph mortgage loan agreement are unfair contractual term under polish law future adverse development related to any of these factor or other factor such potential regulatory or legislative relief across the polish banking industry could have material adverse effect on bank bph and the carrying value of it mortgage loan portfolio and could result in significant loss beyond the amount that we currently estimate environmental health and safety matter our operation like operation of other company engaged in similar business involve the use disposal and cleanup of substance regulated under environmental protection law and nuclear decommissioning regulation additionally like many other industrial company we and our subsidiary are defendant in various lawsuit related to alleged worker exposure to asbestos or other hazardous material liability for environmental remediation nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claim exclude possible insurance recovery it is reasonably possible that our exposure will exceed amount accrued however due to uncertainty about the status of law regulation technology and information related to individual site and lawsuit such amount are not reasonably estimable total reserve related to environmental remediation nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claim were million and million at december and respectively previously reported in ge and the environmental protection agency epa entered into consent decree relating to pcb cleanup of the housatonic river in massachusetts following the epa release in september of an intended final remediation decision ge and the epa engaged in mediation and the first step of the dispute resolution process contemplated by the consent decree in october the epa issued it final decision pursuant to the consent decree which ge and several other interested party appealed to the epa environmental appeal board eab the eab issued it decision in january affirming part of the epa decision and granting relief to ge on certain significant element of it challenge the eab remanded the decision back to the epa to address those element and reissue revised final remedy and the epa convened mediation process with ge and interested stakeholder in february the epa announced an agreement between the epa and many of the mediation stakeholder including ge concerning revised housatonic river remedy based on the mediated resolution the epa solicited public comment on draft permit in july and issued the final revised permit effective january of december and based on it assessment of current fact and circumstance and it defense ge belief that it ha recorded adequate reserve to cover future obligation associated with the proposed final remedy expenditure for site remediation nuclear decommissioning and worker exposure claim amounted to approximately million million and million for the year ended december and respectively we presently expect that such expenditure will be
