to shop at target our team member choose target place of employment and our vendor choose to business with is the reputation we have built many year for serving our four primary constituency guest team member shareholder and the community in which we operate to be successful in the future we must continue to preserve target reputation reputational value is based in large part on perception and broad access to social medium make it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that influence perception of target it may be difficult to control negative publicity regardless of whether it is accurate target position or perceived lack of position on social environmental public policy or other sensitive issue and any perceived lack of transparency about those matter could harm our reputation with certain group or guest reputation may take decade to build negative incident can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycott governmental investigation or litigation in addition vendor and others with we do business may affect our reputation for example cv operates clinic and pharmacy within our store and our guest perception of and experience with cv may affect our reputation negative reputational incident could adversely affect our business through lost sale loss of new store and development opportunity or team member retention and recruiting difficulty if we are unable to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailer our result of operation could be adversely affected in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guest shopping experience through careful combination of price merchandise assortment store environment convenience guest service loyalty program and marketing effort guest perception regarding the cleanliness and safety of our store the functionality reliability and speed of our digital channel and fulfillment option our in stock level and the value of our promotion are among the factor that affect our ability to compete in addition our ability to create personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailer no single competitive factor is dominant and action by our competitor on any of factor or the failure of our strategy could adversely affect our sale gross margin and expense our owned and exclusive brand product help differentiate from other retailer generally carry higher margin than equivalent national brand product and represent significant portion of our overall sale if we are unable to successfully develop support and evolve our owned and exclusive brand if one or of these brand experience loss of consumer acceptance or confidence or if we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property right our sale and gross margin could be adversely affected the retail industry continuing migration to digital channel ha affected the way we differentiate ourselves from other retailer in particular consumer are able to quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real time product availability using digital tool which can lead to decision based solely on price or the functionality of the digital tool consumer may also use third party channel or device such voice assistant and smart home device to initiate shopping search and place order which could sometimes make dependent on the capability and search algorithm of those third party to reach those consumer any difficulty in executing our differentiation effort action by our competitor in response to these effort or failure by vendor in managing their channel content and technology system to support these effort could adversely affect our sale gross margin and expense we are unable to successfully provide relevant and reliable experience for our guest across multiple channel our sale result of operation and reputation could be adversely affected our business ha evolved from an in store experience to interaction with guest across multiple channel in store online mobile social medium voice assistant and smart home device among others our guest are using those channel to shop with and provide feedback and public commentary about our business we must anticipate and meet changing guest expectation and counteract development and investment by our competitor our evolving retailing effort include implementing technology software and process to be able to conveniently and cost effectively fulfill guest order directly from any point within our system of store and distribution center and from our vendor we also need to collect accurate relevant and usable guest data to personalize our offering providing flexible fulfillment option and implementing new technology is complex and may not meet expectation for accurate order fulfillment faster and guaranteed delivery time low price or free shipping and desired payment method even we are successful in meeting expectation for fulfillment if we are unable to offset increased cost of fulfilling order outside of our traditional in store channel with efficiency cost saving or expense reduction our result of operation could be adversely affected if we do not anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preference our sale and profitability could suffer large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decision and effectively manage our inventory in broad range of merchandise category including apparel accessory home décor electronics toy seasonal offering food and other merchandise if we do not obtain accurate and relevant data on guest preference predict changing consumer taste preference spending pattern and other lifestyle decision emphasize the correct category implement competitive and effective pricing and promotion strategy or personalize our offering to our guest we may experience lost sale spoilage and increased inventory markdowns which could adversely affect our result of operation by reducing our profitability investment and infrastructure risksif our capital investment in remodeling existing store building new store and improving technology and supply chain infrastructure do not achieve appropriate return our competitive position financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected our business depends in part on our ability to remodel existing store and build new store in manner that achieves appropriate return on our capital investment our current store remodel program is larger than historic level and is implemented using custom approach based on the condition of each store and characteristic of the surrounding neighborhood when building new store we compete with other retailer and business for suitable location for our store many of our expected new store site are smaller non standard footprint located in fully developed market which require change to our supply chain practice and are generally more time consuming expensive and uncertain undertaking than expansion into undeveloped suburban and ex urban market pursuing the wrong remodel or new store opportunity and any delay cost increase disruption or other uncertainty related to those opportunity could adversely affect our result of operation we are currently making and expect to continue to make significant investment in technology and selective acquisition to improve guest experience across multiple channel and improve our supply chain and inventory management system the effectiveness of these investment can be le predictable than remodeling store and might not provide the anticipated benefit or desired rate of return in addition if we are unable to successfully protect any intellectual property right resulting from our investment the value received from those investment may be eroded which could adversely affect our financial condition pursuing the wrong investment opportunity being unable to make new concept scalable making an investment commitment significantly above or below our need or failing to effectively incorporate acquired business into our business could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely affect our financial condition or result of operation significant disruption in our computer system and our inability to adequately maintain and update those system could adversely affect our operation and negatively affect our guest we rely extensively on our computer system to manage and account for inventory process guest transaction manage and maintain the privacy of guest data communicate with our vendor and other third party service target branded credit and debit card account and summarize and analyze result we also rely on continued and unimpeded access to the internet to use our computer system our system are subject to damage or interruption from power outage telecommunication failure computer virus malicious attack security breach and catastrophic event if our system are damaged or fail to function properly or reliably we may incur substantial repair or replacement cost experience data loss or theft and impediment to our ability to manage inventory or process guest transaction and encounter lost guest confidence which could require additional promotional activity to attract guest and otherwise adversely affect our result of operation we continually invest to maintain and update our computer system implementing significant system change increase the risk of computer system disruption the potential problem and interruption associated with implementing technology initiative well providing training and support for those initiative could disrupt or reduce our operational efficiency and could negatively impact guest experience and guest confidence data security and privacy risksif our effort to provide information security are unsuccessful or if we are unable to meet increasingly demanding regulatory requirement we may face additional costly government enforcement action and private litigation and our reputation and result of operation could suffer we regularly receive and store information about our guest team member vendor and other third party we have program in place to detect contain and respond to data security incident however because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long period of time we may be unable to anticipate these technique or implement adequate preventive measure in addition hardware software or application we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture or other problem that could unexpectedly compromise information security unauthorized party may also attempt to gain access to our system or facility or those of third party with whom we do business through fraud trickery or other form of deceiving our team member contractor and vendor prior to all data security incident we encountered were insignificant our data breach wa significant and went undetected for several week we and our vendor have data security incident since the data breach however to date these other incident have not been material to our result of operation based on the prominence and notoriety of the data breach even minor additional data security incident could draw greater scrutiny if we our vendor or other third party with whom we do business experience additional significant data security incident or fail to detect and appropriately respond to significant incident we could be exposed to additional government enforcement action and private litigation in addition our guest could lose confidence in our ability to protect their information discontinue using our redcards or loyalty program or stop shopping with altogether which could adversely affect our sale reputation and result of operation the legal and regulatory environment regarding information security cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding and ha enhanced requirement for handling personal data complying with new data protection requirement may cause to incur substantial cost require change to our business practice limit our ability to obtain data used to provide differentiated guest experience and expose to litigation and regulatory risk each of which could adversely affect our result of operation supply chain and third party riskschanges in our relationship with our vendor change in tax or trade policy interruption in our supply chain or increased commodity or supply chain cost could adversely affect our result of operation we are dependent on our vendor to supply merchandise to our distribution center store and guest we continue to add capability operating our fulfillment network becomes more complex and challenging if our fulfillment network not operate properly or if vendor fails to deliver on it commitment we could experience merchandise of stock delivery delay or increased delivery cost which could lead to lost sale and decreased guest confidence and adversely affect our result of operation large portion of our merchandise is sourced directly or indirectly from outside the with china our single largest source any major change in tax or trade policy such the imposition of additional tariff or duty on imported product could require to take certain action such raising price on product we sell which could adversely affect our result of operation political or financial instability currency fluctuation the outbreak of pandemic labor unrest transport capacity and cost port security weather condition natural disaster or other event that could slow or disrupt port activity and affect foreign trade are beyond our control and could materially disrupt our supply of merchandise increase our cost and or adversely affect our result of operation have been periodic labor dispute impacting the port that have caused to make alternative arrangement to continue the flow of inventory and if these type of dispute recur worsen or occur in other country through which we source product it may have material impact on our cost or inventory supply change in the cost of procuring commodity used in our merchandise or the cost related to our supply chain could adversely affect our result of operation disruption in relationship with third party service provider could adversely affect our operation we rely on third party to support our business including portion of our technology infrastructure development and support our digital platform and fulfillment operation credit and debit card transaction processing extension of credit for our redcard reward loyalty program the clinic and pharmacy operated by cv within our store the infrastructure supporting our guest contact center aspect of our food offering and delivery service if we are unable to contract with third party the specialized skill needed to support those strategy or integrate their product and service with our business or if they fail to meet our performance standard and expectation our reputation and result of operation could be adversely affected for example if our guest unfavorably view cv operation our ability to discontinue the relationship is limited and our result of operation could be adversely affected legal regulatory global and other external risksour earnings depend on the state of macroeconomic condition and consumer confidence in the nearly all of our sale are in the making our result highly dependent on consumer confidence and the health of the economy in addition significant portion of our total sale is derived from store located in five state california texas florida minnesota and illinois resulting in further dependence on local economic condition in these state deterioration in macroeconomic condition or consumer confidence could negatively affect our business in many way including slowing sale growth reducing overall sale and reducing gross margin these consideration impact the success of our credit card program although we no longer own consumer credit card receivables portfolio we share in the profit generated by the credit card program with td bank group td which owns the receivables generated by our proprietary credit card deterioration in macroeconomic condition or change in consumer preference concerning our credit card program could adversely affect the volume of new credit account the amount of credit card program balance and the ability of credit card holder to pay their balance these condition could result in receiving lower profit sharing payment uncharacteristic or significant weather condition alone or together with natural disaster could adversely affect our operation uncharacteristic or significant weather condition can affect consumer shopping pattern particularly in apparel and seasonal item which could lead to lost sale or greater than expected markdowns and adversely affect our short term result of operation in addition our three largest state by total sale are california texas and florida area where natural disaster are more prevalent natural disaster in those state or in other area where our sale are concentrated could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our store distribution center or key vendor and cause delay in the distribution of merchandise from our vendor to our distribution center store and guest which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost and lowering our sale rely on large global and changing workforce of team member contractor and temporary staffing if we do not effectively manage our workforce and the concentration of work in certain global location our labor cost and result of operation could be adversely affected with over team member our workforce cost represent our largest operating expense and our business is dependent on our ability to attract train and retain the appropriate mix of qualified team member contractor and temporary staffing and effectively organize and manage those resource our business and strategic priority change many team member are in entry level or part time position with historically high turnover rate our ability to meet our changing labor need while controlling our cost is subject to external factor such labor law and regulation unemployment level prevailing wage rate benefit cost changing demographic and our reputation and relevance within the labor market if we are unable to attract and retain workforce meeting our need our operation guest service level support function and competitiveness could suffer and our result of operation could be adversely affected we are periodically subject to labor organizing effort if we become subject to one or more collective bargaining agreement in the future it could adversely affect our labor cost and we operate our business we also have support office in india and china and any extended disruption of our operation in those location whether due to labor difficulty or otherwise could adversely affect our operation and financial result failure to address product safety and sourcing concern could adversely affect our sale and result of operation if our merchandise offering do not meet applicable safety standard or target or our guest expectation regarding safety supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we could experience lost sale and increased cost and be exposed to legal and reputational risk all of our vendor must comply with applicable product safety law and we are dependent on to ensure that the product we buy comply with all safety standard event that give rise to actual potential or perceived product safety concern including food or drug contamination could expose to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recall and other liability our sourcing vendor must also meet our expectation across multiple area of social compliance including supply chain transparency and responsible sourcing we have social compliance audit process but we are also dependent on our vendor to ensure that the product we buy comply with our standard negative guest perception regarding the safety of the product we sell and event that give rise to actual potential or perceived compliance concern could hurt our reputation result in lost sale cause our guest to seek alternative source for their need and make it difficult and costly for to regain the confidence of our guest our failure to comply with federal state local and international law or change in these law could increase our cost reduce our margin and lower our sale our business is subject to wide array of law and regulation in the and other country in which we operate our expense could increase and our operation could be adversely affected by significant legislative change or other legal development on workforce related issue including an employer obligation to recognize collective bargaining unit the process by which collective bargaining agreement are negotiated or imposed the classification of exempt and non exempt employee the distinction employee and contractor minimum wage requirement advance scheduling notice requirement and health care mandate change in the legal or regulatory environment affecting data privacy and information security product safety payment method and related fee responsible sourcing supply chain transparency or environmental protection among others could cause our expense to increase without an ability to pas through any increased expense through higher price in addition if we fail to comply with other applicable law and regulation including wage and hour law the foreign corrupt practice act and local anti bribery law we could be subject to reputation and legal risk including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation which could adversely affect our result of operation by increasing our cost reducing our margin and lowering our sale financial risksincreases in our effective income tax rate could adversely affect our business result of operation liquidity and net income number of factor influence our effective income tax rate including change in tax law and related regulation tax treaty interpretation of existing law and our ability to sustain our reporting position on examination change in any of those factor could change our effective tax rate which could adversely affect our net income in addition our operation outside of the may cause greater volatility in our effective tax rate we are unable to access the capital market or obtain bank credit our financial position liquidity and result of operation could suffer we are dependent on stable liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operation and capital investment our continued access to financial market depends on multiple factor including the condition of debt capital market our operating performance and maintaining strong credit rating if rating agency lower our credit rating it could adversely affect our ability to access the debt market our cost of fund and other term for new debt issuance each of the credit rating agency review it rating periodically and there is no guarantee our current credit rating will remain the same in addition we use variety of derivative product to manage our exposure to market risk principally interest rate and equity price

inventory purchase merchandise royalty equipment purchase marketing related contract software acquisition license commitment and service contract we issue inventory purchase order in the normal course of business which represent authorization to purchase that are cancelable by their term we do not consider purchase order to be firm inventory commitment therefore they are excluded from the table

for lease signed but not yet commenced and commitment for the purchase construction or remodeling of real estate and facility we have not included obligation under our pension plan in the contractual

funding requirement plus periodic discretionary amount determined to be appropriate off balance sheet arrangement other than the unrecorded contractual obligation noted above we do not have any arrangement or relationship with entity that are not consolidated into the financial statement accounting estimatesour consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with gaap which requires to make estimate and apply judgment that affect the reported amount in the note to consolidated financial statement we describe the significant accounting policy used in preparing the consolidated financial statement our management ha discussed the development selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimate with the audit finance committee of our board of director the following item require significant estimation or judgment inventory and cost of sale the vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last in first out method our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market we reduce inventory for estimated loss related to shrink and markdowns our shrink estimate is based on historical loss verified by physical inventory count historically our actual physical inventory count result have shown our estimate to be reliable market adjustment for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise ha diminished we believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turn in le than three month inventory wa million and million at february and february respectively and is further described in note of the financial statement vendor income we receive various form of consideration from our vendor vendor income principally earned result of volume rebate markdown allowance promotion and advertising allowance substantially all vendor income is recorded reduction of cost of sale we establish receivable for vendor income that is earned but not yet received based on the agreement in place this receivable is computed by estimating when we have completed our performance and when the amount is earned the majority of the year end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter and we do not believe there is reasonable likelihood that the assumption used in our estimate will change significantly historically adjustment to our vendor income receivable have not been material vendor income receivable wa million and million at february and february respectively vendor income is described further in note of the financial statement long lived asset long lived asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow independent of other asset which is primarily at the store level an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flow from the operation and or disposition of the asset are le than their carrying amount measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over it fair value fair value is measured using discounted cash flow or independent opinion of value appropriate we recorded impairment of million million and million in and respectively which are described further in note of the financial statement we applied the hindsight practical expedient for measurement of lease asset and liability and associated leasehold improvement asset in our adoption of asu no lease topic which required significant judgment to determine the reasonably certain lease term for existing lease in transition to the new standard using hindsight shortened lease term for many lease operating lease asset and liability were million and million respectively at february finance lease asset and liability were million and million respectively at february lease are described further in note and of the financial statement insurance self insurance we retain substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability worker compensation property loss and team member medical and dental claim however we maintain stop loss coverage to limit the exposure related to certain risk liability associated with these loss include estimate of both claim filed and loss incurred but not yet reported we use actuarial method which consider number of factor to estimate our ultimate cost of loss general liability and worker compensation liability are recorded at our estimate of their net present value other liability referred to above are not discounted our worker compensation and general liability accrual wa million and million at february and february respectively we believe that the amount accrued are appropriate however our liability could be significantly affected if future occurrence or loss development differ from our assumption for example percent increase or decrease in average claim cost would impact our self insurance expense by million in historically adjustment to our estimate have not been material refer to item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further disclosure of the market risk associated with these exposure we maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain event including network security matter tax we pay income tax based on the tax statute regulation and case law of the various jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item and in evaluating the ultimate resolution of tax matter in dispute with tax authority we recognized the income tax effect of the tax act in our and financial statement in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no which provides sec staff guidance for the application of asc topic income tax note of the financial statement provides additional information the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining it is likely the uncertain tax position would withstand challenge by taxing authority we periodically reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate liability for uncertain tax position including interest and penalty were million and million at february and february respectively and primarily relate to continuing operation we believe the resolution of these matter will not have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statement income tax are described further in note of the financial statement pension accounting we maintain funded qualified defined benefit pension plan well several smaller and unfunded nonqualified plan for certain current and retired team member the cost for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using the assumption described in the following paragraph eligibility and the level of benefit varies depending on team member full time or part time status date of hire age and or length of service the benefit obligation and related expense for these plan are determined based on actuarial calculation using assumption about the expected long term rate of return the discount rate and compensation growth rate the assumption with adjustment made for any significant plan or participant change are used to determine the period end benefit obligation and establish expense for the next year our expected long term rate of return on plan asset of percent is determined by the portfolio composition historical long term investment performance and current market condition percentage point decrease in our expected long term rate of return would increase annual expense by million the discount rate used to determine benefit obligation is adjusted annually based on the interest rate for long term high quality corporate bond using yield for maturity that are in line with the duration of our pension liability our benefit obligation and related expense will fluctuate with change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million based on our experience we use graduated compensation growth schedule that assumes higher compensation growth for younger shorter service pension eligible team member than it doe for older longer service pension eligible team member pension benefit are further described in note of the financial statement legal and other contingency we believe the accrual recorded in our consolidated financial statement properly reflect loss exposure that are both probable and reasonably estimable we do not believe any of the currently identified claim or litigation may materially affect our result of operation cash flow or financial condition however litigation is subject to inherent uncertainty and unfavorable ruling could occur if an unfavorable ruling were to occur it may cause material adverse impact on the result of operation cash flow or financial condition for the period in which the ruling occurs or future period refer to note of the financial statement for further information on contingency new accounting pronouncementsrefer to note note and note of the financial statement for description of new accounting pronouncement related to revenue lease and pension expense we do not expect any other recently issued accounting pronouncement will have material effect on our financial statement looking statementsthis report contains forward looking statement which are based on our current assumption and expectation these statement are typically accompanied by the word expect may could believe would might anticipates or word of similar import the principal forward looking statement in this report include our financial performance statement regarding the adequacy of and cost associated with our source of liquidity the continued execution of our share repurchase program our expected capital expenditure and new lease commitment the impact of change in the expected effective income tax rate on net income including those resulting from the tax act the expected compliance with debt covenant the expected impact of new accounting pronouncement our intention regarding future dividend contribution and payment related to our pension plan the expected return on pension plan asset the expected timing and recognition of compensation expense the effect of macroeconomic condition the adequacy of our reserve for general liability worker compensation and property loss the expected outcome of and adequacy of our reserve for investigation inquiry claim and litigation expected change to our contractual obligation and liability the expected ability to recognize deferred tax asset and liability and the timing of such recognition the resolution of tax matter the expected impact of change in information technology system and change in our assumption and expectation all such forward looking statement are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statement contained in the private security litigation reform act of amended although we believe there is reasonable basis for the forward looking statement our actual result could be materially different the most important factor which could cause our actual result to differ from our forward looking statement are set forth on our description of risk factor in item to this form which should be read in conjunction with the forward looking statement in this report forward looking statement speak only of the date they are made and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statement quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskat february our exposure to market risk wa primarily from interest rate change on our debt obligation of which are at london interbank offered rate libor plus floating rate our interest rate exposure is primarily due to difference between our floating rate debt obligation compared to our floating rate short term investment at february our floating rate debt exceeded our floating rate short term investment by approximately million based on our balance sheet position at february the annualized effect of percentage point increase in floating interest rate on our floating rate debt obligation net of our floating rate short term investment would not be significant in general we expect our floating rate debt to exceed our floating rate short term investment over time but that may vary in different interest rate environment see further description of our debt and derivative instrument in note and to the financial statement we record our general liability and worker compensation liability at net present value therefore these liability fluctuate with change in interest rate based on our balance sheet position at february the annualized effect of percentage point decrease in interest rate would be to decrease earnings before income tax by million in addition we are exposed to market return fluctuation on our qualified defined benefit pension plan the value of our pension liability is inversely related to change in interest rate percentage point decrease to the weighted average discount rate would increase annual expense by million to protect decline in interest rate we hold high quality long duration bond and interest rate swap in our pension plan trust at year end we had hedged percent of the interest rate exposure of our funded status more fully described in note and to the financial statement we are exposed to market return on accumulated team member balance in our nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan we control the risk of offering the nonqualified plan by making investment in life insurance contract and prepaid forward contract on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the return on these plan there have been no other material change in our primary risk exposure or management of market risk since the prior year financial statement and

topic amended of february using the modified retrospective approach the modified retrospective approach provides method for recording existing lease at adoption and in comparative period that approximates the result of full retrospective approach in addition we elected the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other thing allowed to carry forward the historical lease classification we also elected the practical expedient related to land easement allowing to carry forward our accounting treatment for land easement on existing agreement in addition we elected the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing lease our election of the hindsight practical expedient resulted in the shortening of lease term for certain existing lease and the useful life of corresponding leasehold improvement in our application of hindsight we evaluated the performance of the leased store and the associated market in relation to our overall real estate strategy which resulted in the determination that most renewal option would not be reasonably certain in determining the expected lease term of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional net lease asset and lease liability of approximately billion and billion respectively of february the difference between the additional lease asset and

routinely enter into arrangement with vendor whereby we do not purchase or pay for merchandise until the merchandise is ultimately sold to guest under the vast majority of these arrangement which represent le than percent of consolidated sale we record revenue and related cost gross we concluded that we are the principal in these transaction for number of reason most notably because we control the overall economics of the transaction including setting the sale price and realizing the majority of cash flow from the sale control the relationship with the customer and are responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide good to the customer merchandise received under these arrangement is not included in inventory in our consolidated statement of financial position because the
