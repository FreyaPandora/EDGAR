should carefully consider the following factor which could materially affect our business financial condition or result of operation you should read these risk factor in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item and our consolidated financial statement and related note in item general economic condition both in the and internationally may adversely affect our result of operation we conduct operation in over country and territory our and international operation are subject to normal cycle affecting the economy in general well the local economic environment in which we operate the factor that create cyclical change to the economy and to our business are beyond our control and it may be difficult for to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factor in particular our business is affected by level of industrial production consumer spending and retail activity and our business financial position and result of operation could be materially affected by adverse development in these aspect of the economy we face significant competition which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we face significant competition on local regional national and international basis our competitor include the postal service of the and other nation various motor carrier express company freight forwarders air courier and others competition may also come from other source in the future some of our competitor have cost and organizational structure that differ from and may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer if we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressure our business financial position and result of operation could be adversely affected the transportation industry continues to consolidate and competition remains strong result of consolidation our competitor may increase their market share and improve their financial capacity and may strengthen their competitive position business combination could also result in competitor providing wider variety of service and product at competitive price which could adversely affect our financial performance change in our relationship with our significant customer including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them could have an adverse impact on no single customer account for or more of our consolidated revenue we do not believe the loss of any single customer would materially impair our overall financial condition or result of operation however collectively some of our large customer might account for relatively significant portion of the growth in revenue in particular quarter or year these customer can drive the growth in revenue for particular service based on factor such new customer product launch trend in the commerce industry such the seasonality associated with the fourth quarter holiday season business merger and acquisition and the overall fast growth of customer underlying business these customer could choose to divert all or portion of their business with to one of our competitor demand pricing concession for our service require to provide enhanced service that increase our cost or develop their own shipping and distribution capability if these factor drove some of our large customer to cancel all or portion of their business relationship with it could materially impact the growth in our business and the ability to meet our current and long term financial forecast our business is subject to complex and stringent regulation in the and internationally we are subject to complex and stringent aviation transportation environmental security labor employment and other governmental law regulation and policy both in the and in the other country in which we operate in addition our business is impacted by law regulation and policy that affect global trade including tariff and trade policy export requirement tax monetary policy and other restriction and charge change in law regulation and policy and the related interpretation may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our cost of business the impact of new law regulation and policy can not be predicted compliance with new law and regulation may increase our operating cost or require significant capital expenditure any failure to comply with applicable law or regulation in the or in any of the country in which we operate could result in substantial fine or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operation which could adversely affect our financial performance security requirement could impose substantial cost on and we could be the target of an attack or have security breach result of concern about global terrorism and homeland security government around the world have adopted or may adopt stricter security requirement that will result in increased operating cost for business in the transportation industry these requirement may change periodically result of regulatory and legislative requirement and in response to evolving threat we can not determine the effect that these new requirement will have on our cost structure or our operating result and these rule or other future security requirement may increase our cost of operation and reduce operating efficiency regardless of our compliance with security requirement or the step we take to secure our facility or fleet we could be the target of an attack or security breach could occur which could adversely affect our operation or our reputation we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such potential change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant federal state and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission for example in the past several year the congress ha considered various bill that would regulate ghg emission while these bill have not yet received sufficient congressional support for enactment some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future even in the absence of such legislation the environmental protection agency spurred by judicial interpretation of the clean air act may regulate ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission and this could impose substantial cost on these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely the timing scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material cost on moreover even without such legislation or regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air service strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation significant number of our employee are employed under national master agreement and various supplemental agreement with local union affiliated with the teamster in addition our airline pilot airline mechanic ground mechanic and certain other employee are employed under other collective bargaining agreement strike work stoppage and slowdown by our employee could adversely affect our ability to meet our customer need and customer may do more business with competitor if they believe that such action or threatened action may adversely affect our ability to provide service we may face permanent loss of customer if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service and this could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation the term of future collective bargaining agreement also may affect our competitive position and result of operation we are exposed to the effect of changing price of energy including gasoline diesel and jet fuel and interruption in supply of these commodity changing fuel and energy cost may have significant impact on our operation we require significant quantity of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicle and are exposed to the risk associated with variation in the market price for petroleum product including gasoline diesel and jet fuel we mitigate our exposure to changing fuel price through our indexed fuel surcharge and we may also enter into hedging transaction from time to time if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge higher fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge may result in mix shift from our higher yielding air product to lower yielding ground product or an overall reduction in volume if fuel price rise sharply even if we are successful in increasing our fuel surcharge we could experience lag time in implementing the surcharge which could adversely affect our short term operating result there can be no assurance that our hedging transaction will be effective to protect from change in fuel price moreover we could experience disruption in energy supply including our supply of gasoline diesel and jet fuel result of war action by producer or other factor beyond our control which could have an adverse effect on our business change in exchange rate or interest rate may have an adverse effect on our result we conduct business across the globe with significant portion of our revenue derived from operation outside the united state our operation in international market are affected by change in the exchange rate for local currency and in particular the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar are exposed to change in interest rate primarily on our short term debt and that portion of our long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting our debt is discussed in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report additionally change in interest rate impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and the related benefit cost recognized in the income statement the impact of change in interest rate on our pension and postretirement benefit obligation and cost is discussed further in the critical accounting policy and estimate section of this report we monitor and manage our exposure to change in currency exchange rate and interest rate and make use of derivative instrument to mitigate the impact of change in these rate on our financial position and result of operation however change in exchange rate and interest rate can not always be predicted or hedged if we are unable to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation our business may suffer our success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the ups brand and our reputation for providing excellent service to our customer service quality issue actual or perceived even when false or unfounded could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customer to use other company also adverse publicity surrounding labor relation environmental concern security matter political activity and the like or attempt to connect our company to these sort of issue either in the united state or other country in which we operate could negatively affect our overall reputation and acceptance of our service by customer damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our business financial position and result of operation and could require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand significant privacy breach or it system disruption could adversely affect our business and we may be required to increase our spending on data and system security we rely on information technology network and system including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support variety of business process and activity in addition the provision of service to our customer and the operation of our network and system involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data including personal information of customer employee and others our franchised center location also are reliant on the use of information technology system to manage their business process and activity our and our franchisees information technology system some of which are managed by third party may be susceptible to damage disruption or shutdown due to failure during the process of upgrading or replacing software database or component thereof power outage hardware failure computer virus attack by computer hacker malicious insider telecommunication failure user error or catastrophic event hacker acting individually or in coordinated group may also launch distributed denial of service attack or other coordinated attack that may cause service outage or other interruption in our business in addition breach in security could expose our customer and franchisees or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently may be difficult to detect for long time and often are not recognized until launched against target result we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure any of these occurrence could result in disruption in our operation the loss of existing or potential customer damage to our brand and reputation and litigation and potential liability for the company in addition the cost and operational consequence of implementing further data or system protection measure could be significant in august broad based malware intrusion targeting retailer throughout the wa discovered and subsequently eradicated at approximately of our franchisees location while the impact of this cyber attack including the cost associated with investigation and remediation activity wa not material to our business and our financial result our effort to deter identify mitigate and or eliminate any future breach may not be successful severe weather or other natural or manmade disaster could adversely affect our business severe weather condition and other natural or manmade disaster including storm flood fire or earthquake epidemic or pandemic or terrorist attack conflict or unrest may result in decreased revenue our customer reduce their shipment or increased cost to operate our business which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation for quarter or year any such event affecting one of our major facility could result in significant interruption in or disruption of our business make significant capital investment in our business of which significant portion is tied to projected volume level we require significant capital investment in our business consisting of aircraft vehicle technology facility and sorting and other type of equipment to support both our existing business and anticipated growth forecasting projected volume involves many factor which are subject to uncertainty such general economic trend change in governmental regulation and competition if we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment need we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity either of which would negatively affect our revenue and profitability in addition to forecasting our capital investment requirement we adjust other element of our operation and cost structure in response to adverse economic condition however these adjustment may not be sufficient to allow to maintain our operating margin in weak economy we derive significant portion of our revenue from our international operation and are subject to the risk of doing business in international market we have significant international operation and while the geographical diversity of our international operation help ensure that we are not overly reliant on single region or country we are continually exposed to changing economic political and social development beyond our control emerging market are typically more volatile than those in the developed world and any broad based downturn in these market could reduce our revenue and adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation we are subject to many law governing our international operation including those that prohibit improper payment to government official and commercial customer and restrict where we can do business our shipment to certain country and the information that we can provide to non government we are subject to change in market and our business plan that have resulted and may in the future result in substantial write down of the carrying value of our asset thereby reducing our net income our regular review of the carrying value of our asset ha resulted from time to time in significant impairment and we may in the future be required to recognize additional impairment charge change in business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition have resulted and may result in further substantial impairment of our intangible fixed or other asset at any time in the future in addition we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charge if we determine that the useful life of our fixed asset or intangible asset are shorter than we originally estimated such change could reduce our net income employee health and retiree health and pension benefit cost represent significant expense to with approximately employee including approximately in the our expense relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefit are significant in recent year we have experienced significant increase in some of these cost largely result of economic factor beyond our control including in particular ongoing increase in health care cost well in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rate that we use to value our benefit plan obligation continued increasing health care cost volatility in investment return and discount rate well change in law regulation and assumption used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expense may adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or require significant contribution to our benefit plan the new national master agreement with the ibt includes change that are designed to mitigate certain of these health care expense but there can be no assurance that our effort will be successful or that the failure or success of these effort will not adversely affect our business financial position result of operation or liquidity we participate in number of trustee managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plan for employee covered under collective bargaining agreement part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit level we have agreed to contribute certain amount to the multiemployer benefit plan during the contract period the multiemployer benefit plan set benefit level and are responsible for benefit delivery to participant future contribution amount to multiemployer benefit plan will be determined only through collective bargaining and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contribution beyond the agreed upon amount except potential surcharge under the pension protection act of in the event that plan enters critical status and our contribution are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule in future collective bargaining negotiation we could agree to make significantly higher future contribution to improve the funded status of one or more of these plan the funded status of these multiemployer plan are impacted by various factor including investment performance health care inflation change in demographic and change in participant benefit level at this time we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contribution if any or whether any material adverse effect on our financial condition result of operation or liquidity could result from our participation in these plan addition to our ongoing multi employer pension plan obligation we may have additional exposure with respect to benefit earned in the central state pension fund the cspf from which ups withdrew in in return for fully funding it allocable share of unfunded vested benefit thereunder in cspf submitted proposed pension suspension plan to the department of treasury under the multiemployer pension reform act of mpra which proposes to make retirement benefit reduction to cspf participant including to the benefit of certain ups employee participant separately ups agreed to provide supplemental benefit under the ups ibt full time employee pension plan to offset certain benefit reduction under the cspf we have no other multi employer pension plan subject to such funding obligation ups ha reviewed the cspf proposed plan to evaluate the validity of the action taken by the cspf the plan compliance with the mpra and proposed regulation thereunder and it potential impact on ups funding obligation under the ups ibt full time employee pension plan we are vigorously challenging the proposed suspension plan because it not fully comply with the law and we do not believe certain action by cspf are valid accordingly we have not assumed or recognized liability for supplemental benefit within the ups ibt full time employee pension plan due to the submission of cspf proposed plan to the department of treasury further we are not able to estimate range of additional obligation if any or determine whether any such amount are material due to number of uncertainty relating to the mpra and proposed regulation thereunder and assumption made by the cspf in it proposed plan we may be subject to various claim and lawsuit

created favorable environment for household however much of the growth in consumer spending ha been centered in the service sector and not in the manufacturing sector retail sale growth wa disappointing throughout most of and finished the year on soft note with an underwhelming holiday season commerce ha been one of the few bright spot for retailer growth in digital sale far outpaced traditional brick and mortar retailer manufacturing continues to struggle with weak export demand and sharp cutback in the mining sector combining to curb domestic industrial production and investment spending in the economy these condition are likely to continue in upcoming quarter and growth is expected to remain fairly uneven in the economy the bifurcation of the economy continues through the first half of given these trend overall volume grew slowly during with those product most aligned with the retail industry and commerce in particular experiencing the most growth global gdp forecast have been reduced in recent month largely driven by growth concern in emerging market china economy continues to decelerate particularly in the manufacturing sector and recent financial market turmoil ha raised concern that the pace of deceleration might be faster than initially expected this in turn ha driven commodity price worldwide and weakened the outlook for china major trading partner such the eu and other emerging asian nation the fall in commodity price ha negative implication for many other emerging economy particularly in latin america and russia which rely on commodity export to drive economic growth outside of emerging market growth in the developed world appears to be continuing at moderate pace and advanced economy such the many eu nation should continue to experience solid growth in the uneven nature of economic growth worldwide combined with trend towards more intra regional trade ha continued the shifting of trade pattern and weakened demand in certain trade lane result of these circumstance we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume level our broad portfolio of product offering and the flexibility inherent in our transportation network have helped adapt to these changing trend while the worldwide economic environment remained challenging in we have continued to undertake several initiative in the and internationally to improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network improve yield management and increase operational efficiency and contain cost across all segment most notably the continued deployment of technology improvement including several facility automation project and the accelerated deployment of our on road integrated optimization and navigation system orion should increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency flexibility and reliability additionally we have continued to utilize newly expanded

and discussion that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitor the performance of our reporting segment we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principle gaap with certain non gaap financial measure including operating profit operating margin pre tax income net income and earnings per share adjusted for the non comparable item discussed previously we believe that these adjusted measure provide meaningful information to assist investor and analyst in understanding our financial result and assessing our prospect for future performance we believe these adjusted financial measure are important indicator of our recurring result of operation because they exclude item that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating result and provide better baseline for analyzing trend in our underlying business additionally these adjusted financial measure are used internally by management for the determination of incentive compensation award business unit operating performance analysis and business unit resource allocation discussed in our critical accounting policy and estimate we recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and net actuarial gain and loss in excess of corridor for company sponsored pension and post retirement liability immediately part of net periodic benefit cost in our result of operation and the discussion that follow we have presented adjusted operating expense adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin excluding the portion of net periodic benefit cost represented by the gain and loss recognized in excess of the corridor this adjusted net periodic benefit cost is comparable to the accounting for our defined benefit plan in our quarterly reporting under gaap and reflects assumption utilizing the expected return on plan asset and the discount rate used for determining net periodic benefit cost the non adjusted net periodic benefit cost reflects the actual return on plan asset and the discount rate used for measuring the projected benefit obligation we believe this adjusted net periodic benefit cost provides important supplemental information that reflects the anticipated long term cost of our defined benefit plan and provides benchmark for historical defined benefit cost trend that can be used to better compare year to year financial performance without considering the short term impact of change in market interest rate equity price and similar factor certain operating expense are allocated between our reporting segment based on activity based costing method these activity based costing method require to make estimate that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment

change to healthcare law and regulation control the volatility of healthcare inflation and remove the risk associated with providing future retiree healthcare negotiated healthcare cost using the

the audited consolidated financial statement for discussion of accounting standard issued but not yet effective critical accounting policy and estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based on our consolidated financial statement which are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america indicated in note to our consolidated financial statement the amount of asset liability revenue and expense reported in our financial statement are affected by estimate and judgment that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principle we base our estimate on prior experience and other assumption that we consider reasonable to our circumstance actual result could differ from our estimate which would affect the related amount reported in our consolidated financial statement while estimate and judgment are applied in arriving at many reported amount we believe that the following matter may involve higher degree of judgment and complexity contingenciesas discussed in note to our consolidated financial statement we are involved in various legal proceeding and contingency the event that may impact our contingent liability are often unique and generally are not predictable at the time contingency is identified we consider all relevant fact part of our evaluation we record liability for loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs from our previously estimated liability these factor could result in material difference between estimated and actual operating result contingent loss that are probable and estimable excluding those related to income tax and self insurance which are discussed further below were not material to our financial position or result of operation of and for the year ended december in addition we have certain contingent liability that have not been recognized of december because loss is not reasonably estimable goodwill and intangible impairmentwe perform impairment testing of goodwill for each of our reporting unit on an annual basis our reporting unit are comprised of the domestic package europe asia america and ismea indian subcontinent middle east and africa reporting unit in the international package reporting segment and the forwarding logistics ups freight the ups store and ups capital and coyote logistic reporting unit in the supply chain freight reporting segment our annual goodwill impairment testing date is october for each reporting unit in assessing goodwill for impairment we initially evaluate qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss the second step includes comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model dcf model and supplement this with observable valuation multiple for comparable company applicable the completion of the dcf model requires that we make number of significant assumption to produce an estimate of future cash flow these assumption include projection of future revenue cost capital expenditure and working capital change in addition we make assumption about the estimated cost of capital and other relevant variable required in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit the projection that we use in our dcf model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business condition for each of our reporting unit the determination of whether goodwill is impaired involves significant level of judgment in these assumption and change in our business strategy government regulation or economic or market condition could significantly impact these judgment we will continue to monitor market condition and other factor to determine if interim impairment test are necessary in future period if impairment indicator are present in future period the resulting impairment charge could have material impact on our result of operation none of the reporting unit incurred any goodwill impairment charge in or change in our forecast could cause carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed their fair value in future period potentially resulting in goodwill impairment charge decrease in the estimated fair value for any of our reporting unit of our most recent goodwill testing date october would not result in goodwill impairment charge trade name with carrying value of million and license with carrying value of million of december are deemed to be indefinite lived intangible and therefore are not amortized impairment test for indefinite lived intangible are performed on an annual basis all of our remaining recorded intangible asset are deemed to be finite lived intangible and are thus amortized over their estimated useful life impairment test for these intangible asset are only performed when triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the intangible if the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on dcf model we incurred impairment charge on intangible asset of million during while there were no impairment of any indefinite lived or finite lived intangible asset in or self insurance accrualswe self insure cost associated with worker compensation claim automotive liability health and welfare and general business liability up to certain limit insurance reserve are established for estimate of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claim well estimate of claim that have been incurred but not yet reported recorded balance are based on reserve level which incorporate historical loss experience and judgment about the present and expected level of cost per claim trend in actual experience are significant factor in the determination of such reserve we believe our estimated reserve for such claim are adequate but actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimate and affect our result of operation parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsworkers compensation automobile liability and general liability insurance claim may take several year to completely settle consequently actuarial estimate are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve the claim number of factor can affect the actual cost of claim including the length of time the claim remains open trend in health care cost and the result of related litigation furthermore claim may emerge in future year for event that occurred in prior year at rate that differs from previous actuarial projection change in state legislation with respect to worker compensation can affect the adequacy of our self insurance accrual all of these factor can result in revision to prior actuarial projection and produce material difference between estimated and actual operating result we sponsor number of health and welfare insurance plan for our employee these liability and related expense are based on estimate of the number of employee and eligible dependent covered under the plan anticipated medical usage by participant and overall trend in

mortality rate and other factor the assumption utilized in recording the obligation under our plan represent our best estimate and we believe that they are reasonable based on information to historical experience and performance well other factor that might cause future expectation to differ from past trend difference in actual experience or change in assumption may affect our pension and other postretirement obligation and future expense the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss each year are change in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligation of the measurement date difference between the expected and the actual return on plan asset change in demographic assumption including mortality participant experience different from

return in parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsdepreciation residual value and impairment of fixed assetsas of december we had billion of net fixed asset the most significant category of which is aircraft in accounting for fixed asset we make estimate about the expected useful life and the expected residual value of the asset and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the asset and the cash flow generated by these asset in estimating the life and expected residual value of aircraft we have relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft type subsequent revision to these estimate could be caused by change to our maintenance program change in the utilization of the aircraft governmental regulation on aging aircraft and changing market price of new and used aircraft of the same or similar type we periodically evaluate these estimate and assumption and adjust the estimate and assumption necessary adjustment to the expected life and residual value are accounted for on prospective basis through depreciation expense we review long lived asset for impairment when circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flow of the asset if the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable write down to fair value is recorded fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or external appraisal applicable we review long lived asset for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flow can be identified the circumstance that would indicate potential impairment may include but are not limited to significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow loss associated with the use of the asset in estimating cash flow we project future volume level for our different air express product in all geographic region in which we do business adverse change in these volume forecast or shortfall of our actual volume compared with our projection could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand this situation would lead to an excess of particular aircraft type resulting in an aircraft impairment charge or reduction of the expected life of an aircraft type thus resulting in increased depreciation expense there were no impairment charge on our property plant and equipment during and fair value measurementsin the normal course of business we hold and issue financial instrument that contain element of market risk including derivative marketable security finance receivables pension asset other investment and debt certain of these financial instrument are required to be recorded at fair value principally derivative marketable security pension asset and certain other investment fair value are based on

certain financial instrument including over the counter derivative instrument are valued using pricing model that consider among other factor contractual and market price correlation time value credit spread and yield curve volatility factor change in the fixed income equity foreign exchange and commodity market will impact our estimate of fair value in the future potentially affecting our result of operation quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to change in commodity price foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price is presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk section of this report we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from acquired user acquired technology and trade name from market participant perspective useful life and discount rate management estimate of fair value are based upon assumption believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate during the measurement period which is one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsincome taxeswe make certain estimate and judgment in determining income tax expense for financial statement purpose these estimate and judgment occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction tax credit benefit and deduction and in the calculation of certain tax asset and liability which arise from difference in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purpose well the interest and penalty related to these uncertain tax position significant change to these estimate may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in subsequent period we ass the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax asset if recovery is not likely we must increase our provision for tax by recording valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable we believe that we will ultimately recover substantial majority of the deferred tax asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet however should there be change in our ability to recover our deferred tax asset our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery wa not likely the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any it is determined that the position meet the recognition threshold the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we have to determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis this evaluation is based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law effectively settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision allowance for doubtful accountslosses on account receivable are recognized when they are incurred which requires to make our best estimate of the probable loss inherent in our customer receivables at each balance sheet date these estimate require consideration of historical loss experience adjusted for current condition trend in customer payment frequency and judgment about the probable effect of relevant observable data including present economic condition and the financial health of specific customer and market sector our risk management process includes standard and policy for reviewing major account exposure and concentration of risk deterioration in macroeconomic variable could result in our ultimate loss exposure on our account receivable being significantly higher than what we have currently estimated and reserved for in our allowance for doubtful account

exposed to market risk from change in certain commodity price foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price all of these market risk arise in the normal course of business we do not

discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instrument and further disclosure are provided in note to the consolidated financial statement commodity price riskwe are exposed to change in the price of refined fuel principally jet diesel and unleaded gasoline well change in the price of natural gas currently the fuel surcharge that we apply to our domestic and international package and ltl service are the primary mean of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price change additionally we periodically use combination of option forward and future contract to provide partial protection from changing fuel and energy price of december and however we had no commodity contract outstanding foreign currency exchange riskwe have foreign currency risk related to our revenue operating expense and financing transaction in currency other than the local currency in which we operate we are exposed to currency risk from the potential change in functional currency value of our foreign currency denominated asset liability and cash flow our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the euro british pound sterling canadian dollar chinese renminbi and hong kong dollar we use forward

resulting from change in short term primarily libor interest rate we also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligation change in interest rate will effectively increase or decrease our liability associated with these benefit plan which also result in change to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future

income at fixed and floating rate of interest equity price riskwe hold investment in various common equity security that are subject to price risk sensitivity analysisthe following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instrument we utilize valuation model to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instrument with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous parallel shift in exchange rate interest rate yield curve and commodity and equity price for option and instrument with non linear return model appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shift parcel service inc and subsidiariesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operationsthere are certain limitation inherent in the sensitivity analysis presented primarily due to the assumption that exchange rate change in parallel fashion and that interest rate change instantaneously in addition the analysis are unable to reflect the complex market reaction that normally would arise from the market shift modeled while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario these estimate should not be viewed forecast we adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive asset and liability in response to change in market condition additionally change in the fair value of foreign currency derivative and commodity derivative are offset by change in the cash flow of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transaction shock test result of december in million in fair value currency derivative change in annual interest expense variable rate debt rate derivative the potential change in fair value from hypothetical weakening of the dollar against local currency exchange rate across all maturity the potential change in annual

factor including macroeconomic condition industry and market condition overall financial performance of the reporting unit change in management strategy or customer and relevant reporting unit specific event such change in the carrying amount of net asset more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all or portion of reporting unit and the testing for recoverability of

no further testing is performed for that reporting unit parcel service inc and subsidiariesnotes to consolidated financial statementsif the qualitative assessment is not conclusive and it is necessary to calculate the fair value of reporting unit then we utilize two step process to test goodwill for impairment first comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit with the aggregate carrying value including goodwill is performed if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it calculated fair value then the second step is performed and an impairment charge is recognized for the amount if any by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value we primarily determine the fair value of our reporting unit using discounted cash flow model and supplement

any or determine whether any such amount are material due to uncertainty regarding the validity of action taken by the cspf incomplete information regarding the cspf proposed benefit reduction uncertainty regarding the process and standard under the mpra whether the proposed plan complies with the mpra and proposed regulation thereunder and the effect of various discount rate and other

commodity price and interest rate these exposure are actively monitored by management to manage the volatility relating to certain of these exposure we enter into variety of derivative financial instrument our objective is to reduce where it is deemed appropriate to do so fluctuation in earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency rate commodity price and interest rate it is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instrument only to the extent necessary to manage exposure we use price sensitive instrument to hedge certain portion of our existing and anticipated transaction we expect that any loss in value for those instrument generally would be offset by increase in the value of those hedged transaction we do not hold or issue derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose credit risk managementthe forward contract swap and option discussed below contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the term of the agreement however we minimize such risk exposure for these instrument by limiting the counterparties to bank and financial institution that meet established credit guideline and by monitoring counterparty credit risk to prevent concentration of credit risk with any single counterparty we have agreement with all of our active counterparties covering the majority of our derivative position containing early termination right and or zero threshold bilateral collateral provision whereby cash is required based on the net fair value of derivative associated with those

we have not historically incurred and do not expect to incur in the future any loss result of counterparty default accounting policy for derivative instrumentswe recognize all derivative instrument
