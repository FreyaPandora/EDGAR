factor you should carefully consider the following risk factor in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form these risk factor are not the risk we face our business could also be affected by additional risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently consider to be immaterial if any of these risk were to occur our business operating result and financial condition well the value of an investment in our common stock could be adversely affected our operating result our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our asset are exposed to the effect of changing commodity price price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng can fluctuate widely globally price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng have experienced significant decline from their historic level during and with excess of supply relative to global demand leading to global inventory build although commodity price began to rise in there wa sharp drop in crude oil price in the fourth quarter of ending lower than where they started at the beginning of the year for the first time since given volatility in commodity price driver and the worldwide economic environment generally price trend may continue to be volatile our revenue operating result and future rate of growth are highly dependent on the price we receive for our crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng the factor influencing these price are beyond our control lower crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng price may have material adverse effect on our revenue operating income cash flow and liquidity and on the amount of dividend we elect to declare and pay on our common stock lower price may also limit the amount of reserve we can produce economically adversely affecting our proved reserve and reserve replacement ratio and accelerating the reduction in our existing reserve level we continue production from upstream field significant reduction in crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng price could also require to reduce our capital expenditure impair the carrying value of our asset or discontinue the classification of certain asset proved reserve in the past three year we recognized several impairment which are described in note impairment and the aplng section of note investment loan and long term receivables in the note to consolidated financial statement if commodity price remain low relative to their historic level and we continue to optimize our investment and exercise capital flexibility it is reasonably likely we will incur future impairment to long lived asset used in operation investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method and unproved property although it is not reasonably practicable to quantify the impact of any future impairment at this time our result of operation could be adversely affected result our ability to declare and pay dividend and repurchase share is subject to certain consideration dividend are authorized and determined by our board of director in it sole discretion and depend upon number of factor including cash available for distribution our result of operation and anticipated future result of operation our financial condition especially in relation to the anticipated future capital need of our property the level of distribution paid by comparable company our operating expense other factor our board of director deems relevant table of content we expect to continue to pay quarterly distribution to our stockholder however our board of director may determine that our fund generated by operation after deducting operating expense are not sufficient to pay our desired level of distribution to our stockholder or to pay distribution to our stockholder at all additionally our board of director ha authorized billion share repurchase program of which billion of repurchase authority remained of december our share repurchase program doe not obligate to acquire specific number of share during any period and our decision to commence discontinue or resume repurchase in any period will depend on the factor that our board of director may consider declaring distribution among others any downward revision in the amount of distribution we pay to stockholder or the number of share we purchase under our share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock we may need additional capital in the future and it may not be available on acceptable term we have historically relied primarily upon cash generated by our operation to fund our operation and strategy however we have also relied from time to time on access to the debt and equity capital market for funding there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available in the future on acceptable term or at all in addition although we anticipate we will be able to repay our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our stated plan there can be no assurance we will be able to do so our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing indebtedness when it matures or in accordance with our plan will be subject to number of factor including market condition our operating performance investor sentiment and our ability to incur additional debt in compliance with agreement governing our outstanding debt if we are unable to generate sufficient fund from operation or raise additional capital for any reason our business could be adversely affected in addition we are regularly evaluated by the major rating agency based on number of factor including our financial strength and condition affecting the oil and gas industry generally for example due to the significant decline in price for crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng in and the expectation that these price could remain depressed the major rating agency conducted review of the oil and gas industry and downgraded our debt rating and those of several company operating in the industry in any downgrade in our credit rating or announcement that our credit rating is under review for possible downgrade could increase the cost associated with any additional indebtedness we incur our business may be adversely affected by deterioration in the credit quality of or default under our contract with third party with we do business the operation of our business requires to engage in transaction with numerous counterparties operating in variety of industry including other company operating in the oil and gas industry these counterparties may default on their obligation to result of operational failure or lack of liquidity or for other reason including bankruptcy market speculation about the credit quality of these counterparties or their ability to continue performing on their existing obligation may also exacerbate any operational difficulty or liquidity issue they are experiencing particularly it relates to other company in the oil and gas industry result of the volatility in commodity price any default by any of our counterparties may result in our inability to perform our obligation under agreement we have made with third party or may otherwise adversely affect our business or result of operation in addition our right any of our counterparties result of default may not be adequate to compensate for the resulting harm caused or may not be enforceable at all in some circumstance we may also be forced to incur additional cost we attempt to enforce any right we have against defaulting counterparty which could further adversely impact our result of operation table of content in particular in august we entered into settlement agreement with petrleos de venezuela pdvsa providing for the payment of approximately billion over five year period in connection with an arbitration award issued by the international chamber of commerce icc tribunal in favor of conocophillips on contractual dispute arising from venezuela expropriation of our interest in the petrozuata and hamaca heavy oil venture and other pre expropriation fiscal measure we collected approximately billion of the billion settlement in if pdvsa were to default on any of it remaining payment obligation under this agreement we may be forced to incur additional cost we seek to recover any unpaid amount under the agreement unless we successfully add to our existing proved reserve our future crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid production will decline resulting in an adverse impact to our business the rate of production from upstream field generally decline reserve are depleted except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activity or through engineering study optimize production performance or identify additional or secondary recovery reserve our proved reserve will decline materially we produce crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid accordingly to the extent we are unsuccessful in replacing the crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid we produce with good prospect for future production our business will experience reduced cash flow and result of operation any cash conservation effort we may undertake result of commodity price decline may further limit our ability to replace depleted reserve the exploration and production of oil and gas is highly competitive industry the exploration and production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid is highly competitive business we compete with private public and state owned company in all facet of the exploration and production business including to locate and obtain new source of supply and to produce oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid in an efficient cost effective manner some of our competitor are larger and have greater resource than we do or may be willing to incur higher level of risk than we are willing to incur to obtain potential source of supply if we are not successful in our competition for new reserve our financial condition and result of operation may be adversely affected any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid reserve could impair the quantity and value of those reserve our proved reserve information included in this annual report ha been derived from engineering estimate prepared by our personnel reserve estimation is process that involves estimating volume to be recovered from underground accumulation of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid that can not be directly measured result different petroleum engineer each using industry accepted geologic and engineering practice and scientific method may produce different estimate of reserve and future net cash flow based on the same available data any significant future price change could have material effect on the quantity and present value of our proved reserve any material change in the factor and assumption underlying our estimate of these item could result in material negative impact to the volume of reserve reported or could cause to incur impairment expense on property associated with the production of those reserve future reserve revision could also result from change in among other thing governmental regulation in addition to change in the quantity and value of our proved reserve the amount of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid that can be obtained from any proved reserve may ultimately be different from those estimated prior to extraction table of content we expect to continue to incur substantial capital expenditure and operating cost result of our compliance with existing and future environmental law and regulation our business is subject to numerous law and regulation relating to the protection of the environment which are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the united state and in other country in which we operate for description of the most significant of these environmental law and regulation see the contingency environmental section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation these law and regulation continue to increase in both number and complexity and affect our operation with respect to among other thing permit required in connection with exploration drilling production and other activity the discharge of pollutant into the environment emission into the atmosphere such nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide mercury and greenhouse gas emission carbon tax the handling use storage transportation disposal and cleanup of hazardous material and hazardous and nonhazardous waste the dismantlement abandonment and restoration of our property and facility at the end of their useful life exploration and production activity in certain area such offshore environment arctic field oil sand reservoir and tight oil play we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital operating and maintenance and remediation expenditure result of these law and regulation any failure by to comply with existing or future law regulation and other requirement could result in administrative or civil penalty criminal fine other enforcement action or third party litigation against to the extent these expenditure with all cost are not ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in future period could be materially adversely affected existing and future law regulation and initiative relating to global climate change such limitation on greenhouse gas emission may impact or limit our business plan result in significant expenditure promote alternative us of energy or reduce demand for our product continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change ha resulted in both existing and pending international agreement and national regional or local legislation and regulatory measure to limit greenhouse gas emission such cap and trade regime carbon tax restrictive permitting increased fuel efficiency standard and incentive or mandate for renewable energy for example in december the united state joined the international community at the conference of the party of the united nation framework convention on climate change in paris that prepared an agreement requiring member country to review and represent progression in their intended greenhouse gas emission reduction goal every five year beginning in while the united state announced it intention to withdraw from the paris agreement there is no guarantee that the commitment made by the united state will not be implemented in whole or in part by state and local government or by major corporation headquartered in the united state in addition our operation continue in country around the world which are party to and have not announced an intent to withdraw from the paris agreement the implementation of current agreement and regulatory measure well any future agreement or measure addressing climate change and greenhouse gas emission may adversely impact the demand for our product impose tax on our product or operation or require to purchase emission credit or reduce emission of greenhouse gas from our operation result we may experience decline in commodity price or incur substantial capital expenditure and compliance operating maintenance and remediation cost any of which may have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation table of content furthermore increasing attention to global climate change ha resulted in an increased likelihood of governmental investigation and private litigation which could increase our cost or otherwise adversely affect our business in and city county state government and trade association in california new york washington rhode island and maryland have filed lawsuit against several oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impact conocophillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuit the ultimate outcome and impact to can not be predicted with certainty and we could incur substantial legal cost associated with defending these and similar lawsuit in the future in addition although our business operation are designed and operated to accommodate expected climatic condition to the extent there are significant change in the earth climate such more severe or frequent weather condition in the market where we operate or the area where our asset reside we could incur increased expense our operation could be adversely impacted and demand for our product could fall for more information on legislation or precursor for possible regulation relating to global climate change that affect or could affect our operation and description of the company response see the contingency climate change section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation domestic and worldwide political and economic development could damage our operation and materially reduce our profitability and cash flow action of the state local and foreign government through sanction tax and other legislation executive order and commercial restriction could reduce our operating profitability both in the united state and abroad in certain location government have imposed or proposed restriction on our operation special tax or tax assessment and payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive information or might cause to violate non disclosure law of other country one area subject to significant political and regulatory activity is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal and national law and regulation currently govern or in some hydraulic fracturing operation prohibit hydraulic fracturing in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by the environmental protection agency epa and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource certain jurisdiction in which we operate including state and local government in colorado have adopted or are considering regulation that could impose new or more stringent permitting disclosure or other regulatory requirement on hydraulic fracturing or other oil and natural gas operation including subsurface water disposal in addition certain interest group have also proposed ballot initiative and constitutional amendment designed to restrict oil and natural gas development generally and hydraulic fracturing in particular for example in colorado voter rejected proposition colorado ballot initiative that would have drastically limited the use of hydraulic fracturing in colorado in the event that ballot initiative local or state restriction or prohibition are adopted and result in more stringent limitation on the production and development of oil and natural gas in area where we conduct operation we may incur significant cost to comply with such requirement or may experience delay or curtailment in the permitting or pursuit of exploration development or production activity such compliance cost and delay curtailment limitation or prohibition could have material adverse effect on our business prospect result of operation financial condition and liquidity table of content the government can also prevent or restrict from business in foreign country these restriction and those of foreign government have in the past limited our ability to operate in or gain access to opportunity in various country action by host government such the expropriation of our oil asset by the venezuelan government have affected operation significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future change in domestic and international regulation may affect our ability to collect payment such those pertaining to the settlement with pdvsa or to obtain or maintain permit including those necessary for drilling and development of well in various location local political and economic factor in international market could have material adverse effect on approximately percent of our hydrocarbon production wa derived from production outside the united state in and percent of our proved reserve of december were located outside the united state we are subject to risk associated with operation in international market including change in foreign governmental policy relating to crude oil natural gas bitumen natural gas liquid or lng pricing and taxation other political economic or diplomatic development including the effect of international trade discussion and dispute changing political condition and international monetary and currency rate fluctuation in particular some country where we operate lack well developed legal system or have not adopted clear legal and regulatory framework for oil and gas exploration and production this lack of legal certainty expose our operation to increased risk including increased difficulty in enforcing our agreement in those jurisdiction and increased risk of adverse action by local government authority such expropriation our business may be adversely affected by price control government imposed limitation on production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid or the unavailability of adequate gathering processing compression transportation and pipeline facility and equipment for our production of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid discussed our operation are subject to extensive governmental regulation from time to time regulatory agency have imposed price control and limitation on production by restricting the rate of flow of crude oil bitumen natural gas and natural gas liquid well below actual production capacity legal requirement are frequently changed and subject to interpretation we can not predict whether future restriction on our business may be enacted or become applicable to our ability to sell and deliver the crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng that we produce also depends on the availability proximity and capacity of gathering processing compression transportation and pipeline facility and equipment well any necessary diluent to prepare our crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng for transport the facility equipment and diluent we rely on may be temporarily unavailable to due to market condition extreme weather event regulatory reason mechanical reason or other factor or condition many of which are beyond our control in addition in certain newer play the capacity of necessary facility equipment and diluent may not be sufficient to accommodate production from existing and new well and construction and permitting delay permitting cost and regulatory or other constraint could limit or delay the construction manufacture or other acquisition of new facility and equipment if any facility equipment or diluent or any of the transportation method and channel that we rely on become unavailable for any period of time we may incur increased cost to transport our crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid and lng for sale or we may be forced to curtail our production of crude oil bitumen natural gas natural gas liquid or lng our investment in joint venture decrease our ability to manage risk we conduct many of our operation through joint venture in which we may share control with our joint venture partner there is risk our joint venture participant may at any time have economic business or legal interest or goal that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or or our joint venture partner may be unable to meet their economic or other obligation and we may be required to fulfill those obligation alone failure by or an entity in which we have joint venture interest to adequately manage the risk associated with any operation acquisition or disposition could have material adverse effect on the financial condition or result of operation of our joint venture and in turn our business and operation table of content we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition we elect to pursue from time to time we may seek to divest portion of our business or investment that are not important to our ongoing strategic objective any disposition we undertake may involve numerous risk and uncertainty any of which could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition in particular we may not be able to successfully complete any disposition on timeline or on term acceptable to if at all whether due to market condition regulatory challenge or other concern in addition the reinvestment of capital from disposition proceeds may not ultimately yield investment return in line with our internal or external expectation any disposition we pursue may also result in disruption to other part of our business including through the diversion of resource and management attention from our ongoing business and other strategic matter or through the disruption of relationship with our employee and key vendor further in connection with any disposition we may enter into transition service agreement or undertake indemnity or other obligation that may result in additional expense for part of our disposition strategy on may we completed the sale of our percent nonoperated interest in the fccl partnership well the majority of our western canada gas asset to cenovus energy consideration for the transaction included million cenovus energy common share we may not be able to liquidate the share issued to by cenovus energy at price we deem acceptable or at all our operation present hazard and risk that require significant and continuous oversight the scope and nature of our operation present variety of significant hazard and risk including operational hazard and risk such explosion fire crude oil spill severe weather geological event labor dispute terrorist attack sabotage civil unrest or cyber attack our operation may also be adversely affected by unavailability interruption or accident involving service or infrastructure required to develop produce process or transport our production such contract labor drilling rig pipeline railcar tanker barge or other infrastructure our operation are subject to the additional hazard of pollution release of toxic gas and other environmental hazard and risk activity in deepwater area may pose incrementally greater risk because of complex subsurface condition such higher reservoir pressure water depth and metocean condition all such hazard could result in loss of human life significant property and equipment damage environmental pollution impairment of operation substantial loss to and damage to our reputation further our business and operation may be disrupted if we do not respond or are perceived not to respond in an appropriate manner to any of these hazard and risk or any other major crisis or if we are unable to efficiently restore or replace affected operational component and capacity our technology system and network may be subject to cyber attack our business like others within the oil and gas industry ha become increasingly dependent on digital technology some of which are managed by third party service provider on whom we rely to help collect host or process information among other activity we rely on digital technology to estimate oil and gas reserve process and record financial and operating data analyze seismic and drilling information and communicate with employee and third party result we face various cyber security threat such attempt to gain unauthorized access to or control of sensitive information about our operation and our employee attempt to render our data or system or those of third party with whom we do business corrupted or unusable threat to the security of our facility and infrastructure well those of third party with whom we do business and attempted cyber terrorism in addition computer control oil and gas production processing equipment and distribution system globally and are necessary to deliver our production to market disruption failure or cyber breach of these operating system or of the network and infrastructure on which they rely many of which are not owned or operated by could damage critical production distribution or storage asset delay or prevent delivery to market or make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for production and settle transaction table of content although we have experienced occasional actual or attempted breach of our cyber security none of these breach have had material effect on our business operation or reputation cyber attack continue to evolve we must continually expend additional resource to continue to modify or enhance our protective measure or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability detected our implementation of various procedure and control to monitor and mitigate security threat and to increase security for our information facility and infrastructure may result in increased cost despite our ongoing investment in security resource talent and business practice we are unable to assure that any security measure will be effective if our system and infrastructure were to be breached damaged or disrupted we could be subject to serious negative consequence including disruption of our operation damage to our reputation loss of counterparty trust reimbursement or other cost increased compliance cost significant litigation exposure and legal liability or regulatory fine penalty or intervention any of these could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition although we have business continuity plan in place our operation may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our system and infrastructure that support our business while we continue to evolve and modify our business continuity plan there can be no assurance that they will be effective in avoiding disruption and business impact further our insurance may not be adequate to compensate for all resulting loss and the cost to obtain

additional information about income tax related contingency environmental we are subject to the same numerous international federal state and local environmental law and regulation other company in our industry the most significant of these environmental law and regulation include among others the federal clean air act which governs air emission federal clean water act which governs discharge to water body european union regulation for registration evaluation authorization and restriction of chemical reach federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla or superfund which imposes liability on generator transporter and arranger of hazardous substance at site where hazardous substance release have occurred or are threatening to occur federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra which governs the treatment storage and disposal of solid waste table of content federal oil pollution act of under which owner and operator of onshore facility and pipeline lessee or permittees of an area in which an offshore facility is located and owner and operator of vessel are liable for removal cost and damage that result from discharge of oil into navigable water of the united state federal emergency planning and community right to know act epcra which requires facility to report toxic chemical inventory with local emergency planning committee and response department federal safe drinking water act which governs the disposal of wastewater in underground injection well department of the interior regulation which relate to offshore oil and gas operation in water and impose liability for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operation well potential liability for pollution damage european union trading directive resulting in european emission trading scheme these law and their implementing regulation set limit on emission and in the case of discharge to water establish water quality limit and establish standard and impose obligation for the remediation of release of hazardous substance and hazardous waste they also in most case require permit in association with new or modified operation these permit can require an applicant to collect substantial information in connection with the application process which can be expensive and time consuming in addition there can be delay associated with notice and comment period and the agency processing of the application many of the delay associated with the permitting process are beyond the control of the applicant many state and foreign country where we operate also have or are developing similar environmental law and regulation governing these same type of activity while similar in some case these regulation may impose additional or more stringent requirement that can add to the cost and difficulty of marketing or transporting product across state and international border the ultimate financial impact arising from environmental law and regulation is neither clearly known easily determinable new standard such air emission standard and water quality standard continue to evolve however environmental law and regulation including those that may arise to address concern about global climate change are expected to continue to have an increasing impact on our operation in the united state and in other country in which we operate notable area of potential impact include air emission compliance and remediation obligation in the united state and canada an example is the use of hydraulic fracturing an essential completion technique that facilitates production of oil and natural gas otherwise trapped in lower permeability rock formation range of local state federal or national law and regulation currently govern hydraulic fracturing operation with hydraulic fracturing currently prohibited in some jurisdiction although hydraulic fracturing ha been conducted for many decade number of new law regulation and permitting requirement are under consideration by the environmental protection agency epa the department of the interior and others which could result in increased cost operating restriction operational delay and or limit the ability to develop oil and natural gas resource governmental restriction on hydraulic fracturing could impact the overall profitability or viability of certain of our oil and natural gas investment we have adopted operating principle that incorporate established industry standard designed to meet or exceed government requirement our practice continually evolve technology improves and regulation change we also are subject to certain law and regulation relating to environmental remediation obligation associated with current and past operation such law and regulation include cercla and rcra and their state equivalent longer term expenditure are subject to considerable uncertainty and may fluctuate significantly we occasionally receive request for information or notice of potential liability from the epa and state environmental agency alleging we are potentially responsible party under cercla or an equivalent state statute on occasion we also have been made party to cost recovery litigation by those agency or by table of content private party these request notice and lawsuit assert potential liability for remediation cost at various site that typically are not owned by but allegedly contain waste attributable to our past operation of december there were site around the united state in which we were identified potentially responsible party under cercla and comparable state law for most superfund site our potential liability will be significantly le than the total site remediation cost because the percentage of waste attributable to versus that attributable to all other potentially responsible party is relatively low although liability of those potentially responsible is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for state site other potentially responsible party at site where we are party typically have had the financial strength to meet their obligation and where they have not or where potentially responsible party could not be located our share of liability ha not increased materially many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the state agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or attain settlement of liability actual cleanup cost generally occur after the party obtain epa or equivalent state agency approval there are relatively site where we are major participant and given the timing and amount of anticipated expenditure neither the cost of remediation at those site nor such cost at all cercla site in the aggregate is expected to have material adverse effect on our competitive or financial condition expensed environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and capitalized environmental cost were million in and are expected to be about million per year in and accrued liability for remediation activity are not reduced for potential recovery from insurer or other third party and are not discounted except those assumed in purchase business combination which we do record on discounted basis many of these liability result from cercla rcra and similar state or international law that require to undertake certain investigative and remedial activity at site where we conduct or conducted operation or at site where conocophillips generated waste wa disposed the accrual also includes number of site we identified that may require environmental remediation but which are not currently the subject of cercla rcra or other agency enforcement activity the law that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively and regardless of fault the legality of the original activity or the current ownership or control of site if applicable we accrue receivables for probable insurance or other third party recovery in the future we may incur significant cost under both cercla and rcra remediation activity vary substantially in duration and cost from site to site depending on the mix of unique site characteristic evolving remediation technology diverse regulatory agency and enforcement policy and the presence or absence of potentially liable third party therefore it is difficult to develop reasonable estimate of future site remediation cost at december our balance sheet included total accrued environmental cost of million compared with million at december for remediation activity in the and canada we expect to incur substantial amount of these expenditure within the next year notwithstanding any of the foregoing and with other company engaged in similar business environmental cost and liability are inherent concern in our operation and product and there can be no assurance that material cost and liability will not be incurred however we currently do not expect any material adverse effect upon our result of operation or financial position result of compliance with current environmental law and regulation climate change continuing political and social attention to the issue of global climate change ha resulted in broad range of proposed or promulgated state national and international law focusing on greenhouse gas ghg reduction table of content these proposed or promulgated law apply or could apply in country where we have interest or may have interest in the future law in this field continue to evolve and while it is not possible to accurately estimate either timetable for implementation or our future compliance cost relating to implementation such law if enacted could have material impact on our result of operation and financial condition example of legislation or precursor for possible regulation that do or could affect our operation include european emission trading scheme ets the program through which many of the european union eu member state are implementing the kyoto protocol our cost of compliance with the eu ets in wa approximately million net share before tax the alberta carbon competitiveness incentive regulation ccir requires any existing facility with emission equal to or greater than metric tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent per year to meet an industry benchmark intensity the total cost of these regulation in wa approximately million the supreme court decision in massachusetts epa ct confirmed that the epa ha the authority to regulate carbon dioxide an air pollutant under the federal clean air act the epa announcement on march published interpretation of regulation that determine pollutant covered by clean air act permitting program fed reg april and the epa and department of transportation joint promulgation of final rule on april that trigger regulation of ghgs under the clean air act may trigger more climate based claim for damage and may result in longer agency review time for development project the epa announcement on january outlining series of step it plan to take to address methane and smog forming volatile organic compound emission from the oil and gas industry the former administration established goal of reducing the level in methane emission from the oil and gas industry by to percent by carbon tax in certain jurisdiction our cost of compliance with norwegian carbon tax legislation in wa approximately million net share before tax we also incur carbon tax for emission from fossil fuel combustion in our british columbia and alberta operation totaling over million net share before tax the agreement reached in paris in december at the conference of the party to the united nation framework on climate change setting new process for achieving global emission reduction while the united state announced it intention to withdraw from the paris agreement there is no guarantee that the commitment made by the united state will not be implemented in whole or in part by state and local government or by major corporation headquartered in the united state in the united state some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future at the federal and state level with respect to ghg emission such regulation could take any of several form that may result in the creation of additional cost in the form of tax the restriction of output investment of capital to maintain compliance with law and regulation or required acquisition or trading of emission allowance we are working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and energy conservation throughout our operation compliance with change in law and regulation that create ghg tax emission trading scheme or ghg reduction policy could significantly increase our cost reduce demand for fossil energy derived product impact the cost and availability of capital and increase our exposure to litigation such law and regulation could also increase demand for le carbon intensive energy source including natural gas the ultimate impact on our financial performance either positive or negative will depend on number of factor including but not limited to whether and to extent legislation or regulation is enacted the timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation the nature of the legislation such cap and trade system or tax on emission or regulation the price placed on ghg emission either by the market or through tax table of content the ghg reduction required the price and availability of offset the amount and allocation of allowance technological and scientific development leading to new product or service any potential significant physical effect of climate change such increased severe weather event change in sea level and change in temperature whether and the extent to which increased compliance cost are ultimately reflected in the price of our product and service the company ha responded by putting in place sustainable development risk management practice covering the assessment and registering of significant and high sustainable development risk based on their consequence and likelihood of occurrence corporate climate change action plan ha been developed to track mitigation activity for each climate related risk included in the corporate sustainable development risk register the risk addressed in our climate change action plan fall into four broad category ghg related legislation and regulation ghg emission management physical climate related impact climate related disclosure and reporting the company us range of estimated future cost of ghg emission for internal planning purpose including an estimated market cost of ghg emission of per metric tonne applied beginning in the year to evaluate certain future project and opportunity the company doe not use an estimated market cost of ghg emission when assessing reserve in jurisdiction without existing ghg regulation in december we became founding member of the climate leadership council clc an international policy institute founded in collaboration with business and environmental interest to develop carbon dividend plan participation in the clc provides another opportunity for ongoing dialogue about carbon pricing and framing the issue in alignment with our public policy principle we also belong to and fund american for carbon dividend the education and advocacy branch of the clc in and city county state government and trade association in california new york washington rhode island and maryland well the pacific coast federation of fisherman association inc have filed lawsuit against oil and gas company including conocophillips seeking compensatory damage and equitable relief to abate alleged climate change impact conocophillips is vigorously defending against these lawsuit the lawsuit brought by the city of san francisco oakland and new york have been dismissed by the district court and appeal are pending other we have deferred tax asset related to certain accrued liability loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards valuation allowance have been established to reduce these deferred tax asset to an amount that will more likely than not be realized based on our historical taxable income our expectation for the future and available tax planning strategy management expects the net deferred tax asset will be realized offset to reversing deferred tax liability table of content new accounting standard in february the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no lease asu no which establishes comprehensive accounting and financial reporting requirement for leasing arrangement this asu supersedes the existing requirement in fasb asc topic lease fasb asc topic and requires lessee to recognize substantially all lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet the provision of asu no also modify the definition of lease and outline requirement for recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of leasing arrangement by both lessee and lessor the asu is effective for interim and annual period beginning after december and early adoption of the standard is permitted entity are required to adopt the asu using modified retrospective approach subject to certain optional practical expedient and apply the provision of asu no to leasing arrangement existing at or entered into after the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statement asu no wa amended in january by the provision of asu no land easement practical expedient for transition to topic asu no and in july by the provision of asu no codification improvement to topic lease asu no in addition asu no wa further amended in july by the provision of asu no targeted improvement asu no and in december by the provision of asu no narrow scope improvement for lessor asu no asu no set forth certain additional practical expedient for lessor and provides entity with an option to apply the provision of asu no amended to leasing arrangement existing at or entered into after the asu effective date of adoption the optional transition method entity that elect to utilize the optional transition method would not apply the provision of asu no amended to comparative period presented in the financial statement we plan to adopt asu no amended effective january utilizing the optional transition method accordingly the comparative period presented in the financial statement prior to january will be presented pursuant to the existing requirement of fasb asc topic and not be adjusted upon the adoption of the asu we also expect to utilize the package of optional transition related practical expedient set forth by asu no amended which permit entity to not reassess upon the adoption of the asu certain historical conclusion regarding lease contract identification and classification well the historical accounting treatment of initial direct cost the package of optional practical expedient for lease arrangement containing both lease and non lease component we will adopt the optional practical expedient to not separate lease component from non lease component for all new or modified lease executed on or after the effective date of the asu subject to making any election for lease after the effective date in new asset class furthermore we do not expect to record asset and liability on our consolidated balance sheet for new or existing lease arrangement with term of month or le the expected impact of the adoption of asu no amended relates primarily to our balance sheet resulting from the initial recognition of lease liability and corresponding right of use asset for our existing population of operating lease well enhanced disclosure of our leasing arrangement we expect to recognize on our consolidated balance sheet approximately billion of operating lease liability and corresponding right of use asset upon the adoption of asu no amended we have implemented third party lease accounting software solution to facilitate the ongoing accounting and financial reporting requirement of the asu and also expect the adoption of the asu to result in certain change being made to our existing accounting policy and system business process and internal control while our evaluation of asu no amended and related implementation activity approach completion we continue to monitor proposal issued by the fasb to clarify the asu for additional information see note new accounting standard in the note to consolidated financial statement table of content critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle requires management to select appropriate accounting policy and to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense see note accounting policy in the note to consolidated financial statement for description of our major accounting policy certain of these accounting policy involve judgment and uncertainty to such an extent there is reasonable likelihood materially different amount would have been reported under different condition or if different assumption had been used these critical accounting estimate are discussed with the audit and finance committee of the board of director at least annually we believe the following discussion of critical accounting estimate along with the discussion of contingency and of deferred tax asset valuation allowance in this report address all important accounting area where the nature of accounting estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change oil and gas accounting accounting for oil and gas exploratory activity is subject to special accounting rule unique to the oil and gas industry the acquisition of geological and geophysical seismic information prior to the discovery of proved reserve is expensed incurred similar to accounting for research and development cost however leasehold acquisition cost and exploratory well cost are capitalized on the balance sheet pending determination of whether proved oil and gas reserve have been discovered on the prospect property acquisition cost for individually significant leasehold management periodically ass for impairment based on exploration and drilling effort to date for relatively small individual leasehold acquisition cost management exercise judgment and determines percentage probability that the prospect ultimately will fail to find proved oil and gas reserve and pool that leasehold information with others in the geographic area for prospect in area with limited or no previous exploratory drilling the percentage probability of ultimate failure is normally judged to be quite high this judgmental percentage is multiplied by the leasehold acquisition cost and that product is divided by the contractual period of the leasehold to determine periodic leasehold impairment charge that is reported in exploration expense this judgmental probability percentage is reassessed and adjusted throughout the contractual period of the leasehold based on favorable or unfavorable exploratory activity on the leasehold or on adjacent leasehold and leasehold impairment amortization expense is adjusted prospectively at year end the book value of the pool of property acquisition cost that individually are relatively small and thus subject to the above described periodic leasehold impairment calculation wa million and the accumulated impairment reserve wa million the weighted average judgmental percentage probability of ultimate failure wa approximately percent and the weighted average amortization period wa approximately two year if that judgmental percentage were to be raised by percent across all calculation before tax leasehold impairment expense in would increase by approximately million at year end the remaining billion of net capitalized unproved property cost consisted primarily of individually significant leasehold mineral right held in perpetuity by title ownership exploratory well currently being drilled suspended exploratory well and capitalized interest of this amount approximately billion is concentrated in major development area the majority of which are not expected to move to proved property in management periodically ass individually significant leasehold for impairment based on the result of exploration and drilling effort and the outlook for commercialization exploratory cost for exploratory well drilling cost are temporarily capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending determination of whether potentially economic oil and gas reserve have been discovered by the drilling effort to justify development table of content if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made the accounting notion of sufficient progress is judgmental area but the accounting rule do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well cost on the expectation future market condition will improve or new technology will be found that would make the development economically profitable often the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserve is dependent on obtaining permit and government or co venturer approval the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control exploratory well cost remain suspended long we are actively pursuing such approval and permit and believe they will be obtained once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas reserve are designated proved reserve for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once determination is made the well not encounter potentially economic oil and gas quantity the well cost are expensed dry hole and reported in exploration expense management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and seismic work and expense the suspended well cost dry hole when it determines the potential field doe not warrant further investment in the near term criterion utilized in making this determination include evaluation of the reservoir characteristic and hydrocarbon property expected development cost ability to apply existing technology to produce the reserve fiscal term regulation or contract negotiation and our expected return on investment at year end total suspended well cost were million compared with million at year end for additional information on suspended well including an aging analysis see note suspended well and other exploration expense in the note to consolidated financial statement proved reserve engineering estimate of the quantity of proved reserve are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amount because of the judgment involved in developing such information reserve estimate are based on geological and engineering assessment of in place hydrocarbon volume the production plan historical extraction recovery and processing yield factor installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limit the reliability of these estimate at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbon despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimate accounting rule require disclosure of proved reserve estimate due to the importance of these estimate to better understand the perceived value and future cash flow of company operation there are several authoritative guideline regarding the engineering criterion that must be met before estimated reserve can be designated proved our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization ha policy and procedure in place consistent with these authoritative guideline we have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserve held by consolidated company well our share of equity affiliate proved reserve estimate are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant change occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field also required by current authoritative guideline the estimated future date when an asset will be permanently shut down for economic reason is based on month average price and current cost this estimated date when production will end affect the amount of estimated reserve therefore price and cost level change from year to year the estimate of proved reserve also change generally our proved reserve decrease price decline and increase price rise table of content our proved reserve include estimated quantity related to production sharing contract reported under the economic interest method well variable royalty regime and are subject to fluctuation in commodity price recoverable operating expense and capital cost if cost remain stable reserve quantity attributable to recovery of cost will change inversely to change in commodity price we would expect reserve from these contract to decrease when product price rise and increase when price decline the estimation of proved developed reserve also is important to the income statement because the proved developed reserve estimate for field serf the denominator in the unit of production calculation of the dd of the capitalized cost for that asset at year end the net book value of productive property plant and equipment pp subject to unit of production calculation wa approximately billion and the dd recorded on these asset in wa approximately billion the estimated proved developed reserve for our consolidated operation were billion boe at the end of and billion boe at the end of if the estimate of proved reserve used in the unit of production calculation had been lower by percent across all calculation before tax dd in would have increased by an estimated million impairment long lived asset used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted before tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose based on judgmental assessment of the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for exploration and production asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on judgmental assessment of future production volume commodity price operating cost and capital decision considering all available information at the date of review differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period see note impairment in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information investment in nonconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence of loss in value and annually following update to corporate planning assumption such evidence of loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount or current fair value le than the investment carrying amount when it is determined such loss in value is other than temporary an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment carrying value and it estimated fair value when determining whether decline in value is other than temporary management considers factor such the length of time and extent of the decline the investee financial condition and near term prospect and our ability and intention to retain our investment for period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment since quoted market price are usually not available the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate differing assumption could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period see the aplng section of note investment loan and long term receivables in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information table of content asset retirement obligation and environmental cost under various contract permit and regulation we have material legal obligation to remove tangible equipment and restore the land or seabed at the end of operation at operational site our largest asset removal obligation involve plugging and abandonment of well removal and disposal of offshore oil and gas platform around the world well oil and gas production facility and pipeline in alaska the fair value of obligation for dismantling and removing these facility are recorded liability and an increase to pp at the time of installation of the asset based on estimated discounted cost estimating future asset removal cost is difficult most of these removal obligation are many year or decade in the future and the contract and regulation often have vague description of what removal practice and criterion must be met when the removal event actually occurs asset removal technology and cost regulatory and other compliance consideration expenditure timing and other input into valuation of the obligation including discount and inflation rate are also subject to change normally change in asset removal obligation are reflected in the income statement increase or decrease to dd over the remaining life of the asset however for asset at or nearing the end of their operation well previously sold asset for which we retained the asset removal obligation an increase in the asset removal obligation can result in an immediate charge to earnings because any increase in pp due to the increased obligation would immediately be subject to impairment due to the low fair value of these property in addition to asset removal obligation under the above or similar contract permit and regulation we have certain environmental related project these are primarily related to remediation activity required by canada and various state within the united state at exploration and production site future environmental remediation cost are difficult to estimate because they are subject to change due to such factor the uncertain magnitude of cleanup cost the unknown time and extent of such remedial action that may be required and the determination of our liability in proportion to that of other responsible party see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information projected benefit obligation determination of the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension and postretirement plan are important to the recorded amount for such obligation on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement the actuarial determination of projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement involves judgment about uncertain future event including estimated retirement date salary level at retirement mortality rate lump sum election rate rate of return on plan asset future health care cost trend rate and rate of utilization of health care service by retiree due to the specialized nature of these calculation we engage outside actuarial firm to assist in the determination of these projected benefit obligation and company contribution requirement for employee retirement income security act governed pension plan the actuary exercise fiduciary care on behalf of plan participant in the determination of the judgmental assumption used in determining required company contribution into the plan due to differing objective and requirement between financial accounting rule and the pension plan funding regulation promulgated by governmental agency the actuarial method and assumption for the two purpose differ in certain important respect ultimately we will be required to fund all vested benefit under pension and postretirement benefit plan not funded by plan asset or investment return but the judgmental assumption used in the actuarial calculation significantly affect periodic financial statement and funding pattern over time projected benefit obligation are particularly sensitive to the discount rate assumption percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligation by million benefit expense is particularly sensitive to the discount rate and return on plan asset assumption percent decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million while percent decrease in the return on plan asset assumption would increase annual benefit expense by million in determining the discount rate we use yield on high quality fixed income investment matched to the estimated benefit cash flow of our plan we are also exposed to the possibility that lump sum retirement benefit taken from pension plan during the year could exceed the total of service and interest component of annual pension expense and trigger accelerated recognition of portion of unrecognized net table of content actuarial loss and gain these benefit payment are based on decision by plan participant and are therefore difficult to predict in the event there is significant reduction in the expected year of future service of present employee or elimination for significant number of employee the accrual of defined benefit for some or all of their future service we could recognize curtailment gain or loss see note employee benefit plan in the note to consolidated financial statement for additional information contingency number of claim and lawsuit are made against the company arising in the ordinary course of business management exercise judgment related to accounting and disclosure of these claim which includes loss damage and underpayment associated with environmental remediation tax contract and other legal dispute we learn new fact concerning contingency we reassess our position both with respect to amount recognized and disclosed considering change to the probability of additional loss and potential exposure however actual loss can and do vary from estimate for variety of reason including legal arbitration or other third party decision settlement discussion evaluation of scope of damage interpretation of regulatory or contractual term expected timing of future action and proportion of liability shared with other responsible party estimated future cost related to contingency are subject to change event evolve and additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the asset in evaluating when customer ha control of the asset we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery

direct and indirect expenditure incurred in bringing an item or product to it existing condition and location but not unusual nonrecurring cost or research and development cost material supply and other miscellaneous inventory such tubular good and well equipment are valued using various method including the weighted average cost method and the first in first out fifo method consistent with industry practice fair value measurement asset and liability measured at fair value and required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy are categorized into one of three different level depending on the observability of the input employed in the measurement level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input are observable input other than quoted price included within level for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroborated input level input are unobservable input for the asset or liability reflecting

included in the balance sheet caption property plant and equipment pp leasehold impairment is recognized based on exploratory experience and management judgment upon achievement of all condition necessary for reserve to be classified proved the associated leasehold cost are reclassified to proved property exploratory cost geological and geophysical cost and the cost of carrying and retaining undeveloped property are expensed incurred exploratory well cost are capitalized or suspended on the balance sheet pending further evaluation of whether economically recoverable reserve have been found if economically recoverable reserve are not found exploratory well cost are expensed dry hole if exploratory well encounter potentially economic quantity of oil and gas the well cost remain capitalized on the balance sheet long sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made for complex exploratory discovery it is not unusual to have exploratory well remain suspended on the balance sheet for several year while we perform additional appraisal drilling and seismic work on the potential oil and gas field or while we seek government or co venturer approval of development plan or seek environmental permitting once all required approval and permit have been obtained the project are moved into the development phase and the oil and gas resource are designated proved reserve table of content management review suspended well balance quarterly continuously monitor the result of the additional appraisal drilling and

for additional information on suspended well development cost cost incurred to drill and equip development well including unsuccessful development well are capitalized depletion and amortization leasehold cost of producing property are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserve amortization of intangible development cost is based on the unit of production method using estimated proved developed oil and gas reserve capitalized interest interest from external borrowing is capitalized on major project with an expected construction period of one year or longer capitalized interest is added to the cost of the underlying asset and is amortized over the useful life of the asset in the same manner the underlying asset depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of pp on producing hydrocarbon property and certain pipeline and lng asset those which are expected to have declining utilization pattern are determined by the unit of production method depreciation and amortization of all other pp are determined by either the individual unit straight line method or the group straight line method for those individual unit that are highly integrated with other unit impairment of property plant and equipment pp used in operation are assessed for impairment whenever change in fact and circumstance indicate possible significant deterioration in the future cash flow expected to be generated by an asset group and annually in the fourth quarter following update to corporate planning assumption if there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered the asset is monitored by management through an established process where change to significant assumption such price volume and future development plan are reviewed if upon review the sum of the undiscounted before tax cash flow is le than the carrying value of the asset group the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value through additional amortization or depreciation provision and reported impairment in the period in which the determination of the impairment is made individual asset are grouped for impairment purpose at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset generally on field by field basis for exploration and production asset because there usually is lack of quoted market price for long lived asset the fair value of impaired asset is typically determined based on the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant or based on multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transaction of similar asset where possible long lived asset committed by management for disposal within one year are accounted for at the lower of amortized cost or fair value le cost to sell with fair value determined using binding negotiated price if available or present value of expected future cash flow previously described the expected future cash flow used for impairment review and related fair value calculation are based on estimated future production volume price and cost considering all available evidence at the date of review the impairment review includes cash flow from proved developed and undeveloped reserve including any development expenditure necessary to achieve that production additionally when probable and possible reserve exist an appropriate risk adjusted amount of these reserve may be included in the impairment calculation table of content impairment of investment in nonconsolidated entity investment in nonconsolidated entity are assessed for impairment whenever change in the fact and circumstance indicate loss in value ha occurred and annually following update to corporate planning assumption when such condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value the fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market price if available or upon the present value of expected future cash flow using discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participant plus market analysis of comparable asset owned by the investee if appropriate maintenance and repair cost of maintenance and repair which are not significant improvement are expensed when incurred property disposition when complete unit of depreciable property are sold the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated with any gain or loss reflected in the gain on disposition line of our consolidated income statement when le than complete unit of depreciable property are disposed of or retired which do not significantly alter the depreciation depletion and amortization dd rate the difference between asset cost and salvage value is charged or credited to accumulated depreciation asset retirement obligation and environmental cost the fair value of legal obligation to retire and remove long lived asset are recorded in the period in which the obligation is incurred typically when the asset is installed at the production location when the liability is initially recorded we capitalize this cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related pp if in subsequent period our estimate of this liability change we will record an adjustment to both the liability and pp over time the liability is increased for the change in it present value and the capitalized cost in pp is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset reduction to estimated liability for asset that are no longer producing are recorded credit to impairment if the asset had been previously impaired or credit to dd if the asset had not been previously impaired for additional information see note asset retirement obligation and accrued environmental cost environmental expenditure are expensed or capitalized depending upon their future economic benefit expenditure relating to an existing condition caused by past operation and those having no future economic benefit are expensed liability for environmental expenditure are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless acquired in purchase business combination which we record on discounted basis when environmental assessment or cleanup are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated recovery of environmental remediation cost from other party are recorded asset when their receipt is probable and estimable guarantee the fair value of guarantee is determined and recorded liability at the time the guarantee is given the initial liability is subsequently reduced we are released from exposure under the guarantee we amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period if one exists based on the fact and circumstance surrounding each type of guarantee in case where the guarantee term is indefinite we reverse the liability when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period the fair value of our guarantee exposure decline over time we amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee when it becomes probable that we will have to perform on guarantee we accrue separate liability if it is reasonably estimable based on the fact and circumstance at that time we reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee share based compensation we recognize share based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period the stated period of time required to earn the award or the period beginning

liability based on management best estimate using all information that is available at the time we measure estimate and base liability on currently available fact existing technology and presently enacted law and regulation taking into account stakeholder and business consideration when measuring environmental liability we also consider our prior experience in remediation of contaminated site other company cleanup experience and data released by the environmental protection agency epa or other organization we consider unasserted claim in our determination of environmental liability and we accrue them in the period they are both probable and reasonably estimable although liability of those potentially responsible for environmental remediation cost is generally joint and several for federal site and frequently so for other site we are usually only one of many company cited at particular site due to the joint and several liability we could be responsible for all cleanup cost related to any site at which we have been designated potentially responsible party we have been successful to date in sharing cleanup cost with other financially sound company many of the site at which we are potentially responsible are still under investigation by the epa or the agency concerned prior to actual cleanup those potentially responsible normally ass the site condition apportion responsibility and determine the appropriate remediation in some instance we may have no liability or may attain settlement of liability where it appears that other potentially responsible party may be financially unable to bear their proportional share we consider this inability in estimating our potential liability and we adjust our accrual accordingly result of various acquisition in the past we assumed certain environmental obligation some of these environmental obligation are mitigated by indemnification made by others for our benefit and some of the indemnification are subject to dollar limit and time limit we are currently participating in environmental assessment and cleanup at numerous federal superfund and comparable state and international site after an assessment of
