government spending and deficit the threat environment political condition and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt the current global supply chain and labor market challenge and inflationary pressure have negatively affected and we expect will continue to negatively affect our performance well the performance of our supplier and subcontractor in addition due to the nature of our government and commercial aerospace business and their respective customer and supplier contract we may be unable to increase our contract value or pricing to offset cost increase in particular on our fixed price contract our operating profit and margin under our contract could be adversely affected by these factor similarly interest rate increase have created financial market volatility and could further negatively impact financial market lead to an economic downturn or recession and tighten the availability of and increase the cost of capital for the company which could have an adverse effect on our operating result financial condition and liquidity tightening of credit in financial market also could adversely affect the ability of our customer and supplier to obtain financing for significant purchase and operation could result in decrease in or cancellation of order for our product and service could impact the ability of our customer to make payment and could increase the risk of supplier financial distress our global business is also adversely affected by decrease in the general level of economic activity such decrease in business and consumer spending air travel the financial strength of airline and business jet operator and government procurement in addition geopolitical risk could affect government priority budget and policy such approval of our foreign defense sale well sanction and other trade restrictive activity which could impact sale of defense and other product and service change in government defense spending could negatively impact our financial position result of operation liquidity and overall business government sale constitute significant portion of our consolidated sale our government revenue largely result from contract awarded under various government program primarily defense related program with the department of defense dod and broad range of program with the intelligence community and other department and agency change in government defense spending for various reason including result of potential change in policy or budgetary position or priority could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity our program are subject to government policy budget decision and appropriation process which are driven by numerous factor including domestic and broader geopolitical event macroeconomic condition and the ability of the government to enact relevant legislation such appropriation bill in recent year government appropriation have been affected by larger government budgetary issue and related legislation and the government ha been unable to complete it budget process the end of it fiscal year resulting in both governmental shutdown and continuing resolution cr providing only enough fund for government agency to continue operating at prior year level further if the government debt ceiling is not raised and the national debt reach the statutory debt ceiling the government could default on it debt result government defense spending level are subject to wide range of outcome and are difficult to predict beyond the near term due to numerous factor including the external threat environment future governmental priority and the state of governmental finance significant change in government defense spending or change in government priority policy and requirement could have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we face risk relating to our government contract and the mix of our government contract and program the termination of one or more of our government contract or the occurrence of performance delay cost overrun due to inflation or otherwise product failure shortage in material component or labor or contract definitization delay could negatively impact our competitive position result of operation financial condition and liquidity government contract generally permit the government to terminate the contract in whole or in part without prior notice at the government convenience or for default based on performance if one of our contract is terminated for convenience we would generally be entitled to payment for our allowable cost and would receive some allowance for profit on the work performed if one of our contract is terminated for default we would generally be entitled to payment for work accepted by the government termination arising of our default could expose to liability and have negative impact on our ability to obtain future contract and order in addition we are subcontractor on some contract and the government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise without regard to our performance subcontractor we may not be able to offset lost revenue resulting from contract termination moreover the funding of government program is subject to of contentscongressional appropriation made on fiscal year basis even for multi year program program are often only partially funded initially and may not continue to be funded in future year appropriation bill may be delayed which may result in delay to funding the collection of receivables and our contract performance due to lack of authorized fund to procure related product and service the timing of contract definitization can be affected by factor specific to the government including staffing limitation under certain circumstance we may use our own fund to meet our customer desired delivery date or other requirement but we may not be reimbursed further if appropriation for one of our program become unavailable reduced or delayed the government may terminate for convenience our contract or subcontract under that program in addition our government contract typically involve the development application and manufacture of advanced defense and technology system and product aimed at achieving challenging goal result of untested or unproven technology or modified requirement or specification we may experience technological and other performance difficulty including delay setback cost overrun or product failure our attention or resource may be diverted from other project and our future sale opportunity may be impacted additionally our customer demand more mature and proven solution we may be required to invest in development prior to contract award with no guarantee of award our government contract are typically either fixed priced contract or cost reimbursement contract fixed price contract are predominantly either firm fixed price ffp contract or fixed price incentive fpi contract under ffp contract we receive fixed price irrespective of the actual cost we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overrun under fpi contract we generally share with the government saving for cost underruns le than target cost and expense for cost overrun exceeding target cost to negotiated ceiling price we carry the entire burden of cost overrun exceeding the ceiling price amount under fpi contract under cost reimbursable contract we are reimbursed for allowable cost and paid fixed or performance based fee but we are generally not reimbursed for unauthorized cost exceeding cost ceiling amount or cost not allowable under the contract or applicable regulation if we are unable to control cost or if our initial cost estimate are incorrect our profitability could be negatively affected particularly under fixed price development contract we may also experience cost underruns which would reduce contract value and related expected revenue and we may be unable to expand the contract scope or secure additional work to offset the resulting lost revenue while contract for development program with complex design and technical challenge are typically cost reimbursable they can be ffp or fpi which can significantly increase our risk of potential negative profit adjustment development contract by nature involve element that have not been undertaken before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost growth in addition other contract in backlog are for the transition from development to production which includes starting and stabilizing manufacturing and test line while the final design is still being validated moreover over the past several year the dod ha increased it use of other transaction authority ota contract under which it award certain prototype research and production contract without all of the procurement requirement that typically apply to dod contract including justification of sole source award otas may use fixed price contracting during all phase of the contract or mandated contract cost sharing one third of program cost they may also require non traditional subcontractor participation and impose other requirement that differ from our other dod contract our business may be negatively impacted if we are unable to perform on our ota contract including any applicable non traditional requirement in addition in order to support government priority we may begin performance prior to completing contract negotiation for an undefinitized contract action with not to exceed price uncertainty in final contract price specification and term or loss of negotiating leverage associated with particularly long delay in contract definitization may negatively affect our profitability our government contract also require to comply with extensive and evolving procurement rule and regulation and subject to potential government audit investigation and dispute we are also involved in program that are classified by the government which have security requirement that place limit on our ability to discus our performance on these program including any risk dispute and claim our international business is subject to economic regulatory competition and other risk our international sale and operation are subject to risk associated with political and economic factor regulatory requirement competition and other risk significant portion of our sale are international including export sale our non operation transaction may be denominated in local currency foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation including their impact on supplier price may negatively affect demand for our product and our reported profit well our operating margin the majority of our commercial aerospace sale are in dollar while the majority of their non cost are incurred in the applicable local currency pratt whitney canada is especially susceptible to fluctuation in exchange rate for this reason in addition because our financial statement are denominated in dollar currency fluctuation may cause translation gain or loss for non operating unit financial statement our international sale and operation are also subject to risk associated with local government law regulation and policy including with respect to investment taxation exchange control capital control employment regulation and repatriation of earnings differing legal system custom and contract law and regulation pose additional risk international transaction may include contractual term that differ from those of similar contract in the or that may be interpreted differently in foreign country in addition in certain foreign country we engage foreign non employee representative and consultant for of contentsinternational sale and teaming with international subcontractor partner and supplier for international program while we have robust policy and control in place these engagement expose to various challenge including risk associated with the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and local antibribery law and regulation from time to time we have dispute with such representative regarding claimed commission and other matter which can result in litigation or arbitration in addition we face risk related to the unintended or unauthorized use of our product our international business face substantial competition from both company and foreign company in some instance foreign company may be owned by foreign government or may receive loan marketing subsidy and other assistance from their government that may not be available to company or our foreign subsidiary in addition foreign company may be subject to fewer restriction on technology transfer than company our international contract particularly for sale of defense product and service may include offset or industrial cooperation obligation requiring specific local purchase manufacturing agreement technology transfer agreement or financial support obligation sometimes in the form of in country industrial participation icip agreement approval of offset or icip threshold and requirement may be subjective and time consuming and may delay contract award certain customer demand are increasing for greater offset or icip commitment level higher value content including the transfer of technology and capability and local production and economic development result of the above factor we could experience financial penalty and award and funding delay on international program our profitability on these program could be negatively affected and we could incur loss on these program that could negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity geopolitical factor and change in policy and regulation could adversely affect our business our international sale and operation are sensitive to change in foreign national priority foreign government budget and regional and local political and economic factor including volatility in energy price or supply political or civil unrest change in threat environment and political relation geopolitical uncertainty and change in foreign policy our international sale and operation are also sensitive to change in foreign government law regulation and policy including those related to tariff sanction embargo export and import control and other trade restriction event such increased trade restriction or retaliatory trade policy renegotiation of existing trade agreement or regime change can affect demand for our product and service the competitive position of our product our supply chain and our ability to manufacture or sell product in certain country further operation in emerging market country are subject to additional risk including volatility in gross domestic product and rate of economic growth government instability cultural difference such employment and business practice the imposition of exchange and capital control and risk associated with exporting component manufactured in those country for incorporation into finished product completed in other country while these factor and their impact are difficult to predict any one or more of them could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation financial condition or liquidity in addition given the role of our defense business in the support of the national security interest of the and it ally we are subject to risk and uncertainty relating to policy of the and it ally well other country including those that are or become regarded potential adversary or threat we engage in both direct commercial sale which generally require government license and approval well foreign military sale which are government to government transaction initiated by and carried out at the direction of the government change in budget and spending level policy or priority which are subject to geopolitical risk and threat may impact our defense business including the timing of and delay in government license and approval for sale the risk of sanction or other restriction well potential human right issue associated with the use of our defense product these risk and uncertainty may directly or indirectly impact our commercial business well of note china previously announced it may take measure against raytheon technology corporation rtc in connection with certain foreign military sale to taiwan involving rtc product and service in addition china ha indicated that it decided to sanction our chairman and chief executive officer gregory hayes in connection with another potential foreign military sale to taiwan involving rtc product and service rtc is not aware of any specific sanction against mr hayes or rtc or the nature or timing of any future potential sanction or countermeasure if china were to impose sanction or take other regulatory action against rtc our supplier affiliate or partner it could potentially disrupt our business operation the impact of potential sanction or other action by china can not be determined at this time from time to time our business have sold and are expected to sell in the future additional defense product to taiwan and we are unable to determine the potential impact if any of any future sanction or other action by china in response to these sale moreover the chinese government ha generally expanded it ability to restrict china related import export and investment activity which may have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct business or sell our commercial aerospace product in china in addition in response to the russian military invasion of ukraine on february the government and the government of various jurisdiction in which we operate including canada the united kingdom the european union and others have of contentsimposed broad economic sanction and export control targeting specific industry entity and individual in russia the russian government ha implemented similar counter sanction and export control targeting specific industry entity and individual in the and other jurisdiction in which we operate including certain member of the company management team and board of director these government measure among other limitation restrict transaction involving various russian bank and financial institution and impose enhanced export control limiting transfer of various good software and technology to and from russia including broadened export control specifically targeting the aerospace sector these measure have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the company and or our supply chain business partner or customer our financial performance is dependent on the condition of the aerospace industry our aerospace business constitute substantial portion of our financial result and the performance of those business is directly tied to economic condition in the commercial aerospace industry which is cyclical in nature capital spending and demand for aircraft engine aerospace product and component aftermarket part and service by commercial airline lessor other aircraft operator and aircraft manufacturer are influenced by wide variety of factor including current and predicted traffic level load factor aircraft fuel price labor issue airline consolidation bankruptcy and restructuring activity competition the retirement of older aircraft regulatory change terrorism and related safety concern general economic condition tightening of credit in financial market corporate profitability cost reduction effort and remaining performance obligation level any of these factor could reduce the sale and margin of our aerospace business other factor including future terrorist action aviation safety concern pandemic health issue or major natural disaster could also dramatically reduce the demand for commercial air travel which could negatively impact the sale and margin of our aerospace business additionally because substantial portion of product delivery to commercial aerospace customer are scheduled for delivery in the future change in economic condition may cause customer to request that firm order be rescheduled or canceled at time our aerospace business also enter into firm fixed price or cost share development contract with customer which may require to bear cost overrun related to unforeseen technical and design challenge that arise during the development and early production stage of the program spare part sale and aftermarket service trend are affected by similar factor including usage pricing technological improvement regulatory change and the retirement of older aircraft furthermore because of the lengthy research and development cycle involved in bringing product in these business segment to market we can not predict the economic condition that will exist when any new product is ready to enter into service reduction in spending in the commercial aviation industry could have significant effect on the demand for our product which could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation financial condition or liquidity we design manufacture and service product that incorporate advanced technology the introduction of new product and technology involves risk and we may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated the design development production sale and support of innovative commercial aerospace and defense system and product involves advanced technology we invest substantial amount in research and development effort to pursue advancement in wide range of technology product and service aimed at meeting the ever evolving product program and service need of our customer our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of our investment depends on variety of factor including meeting development production certification and regulatory approval schedule receiving regulatory approval execution of internal and external performance plan achieving cost and production efficiency availability and quality of supplier and internally produced part and material availability of supplier and internal facility capacity to perform maintenance repair and overhaul service availability of test equipment development of complex software hiring and training of qualified personnel identification of emerging technological trend for our target end customer the level of customer interest in new technology and product and customer acceptance of our product and technology for example our customer manufacture or acquire end product and system that incorporate certain of our product these end product and system may also incorporate additional technology manufactured by third party and involve additional risk and uncertainty result the performance and industry acceptance of these larger system and end product could affect the level of customer interest in and acceptance of our product in the marketplace in addition many of our product must adhere to strict regulatory and market driven safety and performance standard in variety of jurisdiction the evolving nature of these standard along with the long duration of development production and aftermarket support program creates uncertainty regarding program profitability particularly with our aircraft engine product development effort divert resource from other potential investment in our business and these effort may not lead to the development of new technology or product on timely basis or meet the need of our customer fully competitive offering in addition the industry for our product or product that incorporate our technology may not develop or grow we anticipate we or our customer supplier or subcontractor may encounter difficulty in developing and producing new product and service and may not realize the degree or timing of benefit initially anticipated or may otherwise suffer significant adverse financial consequence due to the design complexity of our product or those of our customer or third party manufacturer that incorporate our product into or our customer product we may experience delay in completing the development and introduction of new product or we may experience the suspension of production these product enter into service due to safety concern delay and or of contentssuspension of production could result in increased development cost or deflect resource from other project any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation financial condition or liquidity in particular pratt whitney is currently producing and delivering the geared turbofan engine to power various aircraft the level of order received for the geared turbofan family of engine coupled with requirement to achieve mature production level in very short time frame require significant additional manufacturing and supply chain capacity if any of our production ramp up effort are delayed if supplier can not timely deliver or perform to our standard and or if we identify or experience issue with in service engine we may not meet customer delivery schedule which could result in material additional cost including liquidated damage or other liability that could be assessed under existing contract competition may reduce our revenue and limit our future opportunity we operate in highly competitive industry and our competitor may have more extensive or more specialized engineering manufacturing marketing and servicing capability than we do our contract are typically awarded on competitive basis our bid are based in part upon the cost to provide the product and service if we fail to accurately estimate these cost the profitability of our contract may be adversely affected in addition we may face customer directed cost reduction target that could have material adverse effect on the profitability of our contract if these target are not achieved when required we have also experienced highly competitive pricing in which bidder may anticipate making substantial investment in program in order to win the work moreover bid protest from unsuccessful bidder on new program award are frequent with respect to dod award in particular generally bid protest will delay the start of contract activity delay earnings and could result in the award decision being overturned and require re bid of the contract highly competitive activity within the commercial aerospace industry ha included substantial discount and other financial incentive performance and operating cost guarantee and participation in financing arrangement in order to secure both new engine business and the aftermarket revenue associated with these product further our competitor including our customer may develop competing technology which gain industry acceptance in advance of or instead of our product or meet particular in demand technological need before or with technology that is superior to our existing or new technology in addition our competitor or customer might develop new technology or offering that might cause our existing technology and offering to become obsolete or otherwise decrease demand for our offering in addition the possibility exists that competitor or customer will develop aftermarket service and part for our product that attract customer and adversely impact our return on investment on new product we also anticipate company continuing to enhance their competitive position against our defense business result of continued domestic and cross border defense industry consolidation and the expansion of competitor capability throughout the supply chain through vertical integration we are also facing heightened competition domestically and internationally from foreign and multinational firm additionally some customer including the dod are increasingly turning to commercial contractor rather than traditional defense contractor for space related technology and for information technology and other support work if we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitor in our core business we may experience decline in revenue and industry segment share which could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation financial condition or liquidity the coronavirus disease covid pandemic ha affected our business and we continue to face risk associated with it the covid pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy our business and operation and the industry in which we operate the pandemic and government business and individual action in response including lockdown quarantine border closing and other travel restriction and requirement remote working facility closure and reduced business and leisure travel led to significant decline in demand for commercial air travel in and and therefore for our commercial aerospace product and service while we have seen sign of ongoing recovery in the overall demand for commercial air travel and currently expect that recovery to continue some commercial aviation segment have recovered le quickly than others and it remains uncertain when commercial air traffic will fully return to and or exceed pre pandemic level the resulting financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to wide range of factor and future development in addition resurgence of the pandemic including covid variant regional lockdown or other negative development associated with the pandemic could hinder or reverse the commercial air traffic recovery negative development concerning the effect of the pandemic or additional variant the efficacy and acceptance of vaccine new or continued action to contain the pandemic spread or treat it impact and governmental business and individual action taken in response to the pandemic lockdown quarantine border closing and other travel restriction and requirement remote working facility closure and reduced business and leisure travel pattern and work environment could create significant business disruption for and our supplier subcontractor and customer exacerbate existing supply chain and labor shortage redirect government fund and decrease defense budget and negatively affect global economic condition these factor could hinder or delay our production capability impede our ability to perform on our obligation to our customer result in increased cost to and decreased demand for our product and service and could negatively affect our performance on our customer of contentscontracts and our business result of operation financial condition and liquidity the ultimate duration and financial impact of the covid pandemic remains unknown at this time operational riskswe depend on the availability of material and performance of our supplier and the impact of global supply chain and labor market disruption on our supply chain have negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business our performance requires variety of raw material supplier provided part component sub system and contract manufacturing service and we rely on and non supplier including third party manufacturing supplier subcontractor and service provider and commodity market for these material and service in some instance we depend upon single source of supply manufacturing service support or assembly or participate in commodity market that may be subject to allocation of limited supply by supplier in addition our defense business are subject to specific procurement requirement that limit the type of material they use our defense business also must require supplier to comply with various dod requirement including cybersecurity requirement any of which requirement may further limit the supplier and subcontractor they may utilize identifying and qualifying second or third source supplier can be difficult time consuming and may result in increased cost in addition global supply chain and labor market are continuing to experience high level of disruption causing significant material and part shortage well delivery delay labor shortage distribution issue energy cost increase and price increase current geopolitical condition including sanction and other trade restrictive activity and strained intercountry relation are contributing to these issue certain of our supplier and subcontractor have been unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel for their performance we and our supplier and subcontractor have also experienced difficulty in procuring necessary raw material and component including microelectronics all of the above have contributed to price increase these issue have led to significant supplier and subcontractor performance failure and delay result of these various problem we have difficulty receiving necessary material component other supply and third party service timely or at all which have negatively impacted production flow in our factory hindered our ability to perform on our commitment to customer and negatively affected our result of operation financial condition and liquidity our supply cost have increased due to the above factor continuing high inflation ha exacerbated these increase and increased our operating cost in addition we are largely dependent upon foreign source for certain raw material such cobalt tantalum chromium rhenium nickel and titanium moreover some of our single source component are sourced from foreign country some raw material and component have been in the past sourced from area now under sanction such russia or are currently sourced from area which are at risk of sanction or other trade restrictive action such china we work continuously to mitigate the effect of these supply chain issue and risk including providing raw material and technical support to our supplier and subcontractor well providing them with access to our contract labor network to augment supplier and subcontractor workforce seeking alternate supply source increasing our inventory of available material and part pursuing various cost reduction such long term agreement and leveraging our raw material supply contract to apply our negotiated rate to our supplier purchase the timing of the impact of these supply chain risk and issue and our ability to mitigate them are uncertain and difficult to predict however we expect the current supply chain labor availability and price issue and their negative impact on our business to continue in particular we expect to experience prolonged delay for certain critical component part and sub system furthermore the existing supply chain and labor market issue could be compounded by other event such an economic downturn supplier capacity constraint for other reason supplier quality issue for example defect or fraudulent part supplier closing bankruptcy or financial difficulty price increase for various reason worsening shortage of raw material or commodity and energy supply constraint including result of war or other geopolitical action natural disaster including the effect of climate change health pandemic or other business continuity event or transport and distribution issue any of which could further negatively impact our ability to meet our commitment to customer or increase our operating cost and therefore incrementally affect our result of operation financial condition and liquidity due to the nature of our product and service product safety failure or other failure affecting our or our customer or supplier product or system could seriously harm our business our product and service are highly sophisticated and specialized involve complex advanced technology are often integrated with third party product and service and are utilized for specific purpose that require precision reliability and durability many of our product and service include both hardware and software that involve industrial machinery and intricate aviation and defense system including commercial and military jet engine power and control system and other aircraft part air and missile defense system and military sensor and command and control system technical mechanical and other failure may occur from time to time whether result of manufacturing or design defect operational process or production issue attributable to our customer supplier third party integrator or others in addition our product could fail result of cyber attack such those that seize control and result in misuse or unintended use of our product or other intentional act the impact of catastrophic product or system failure or similar event affecting our or our customer or supplier product or service could be significant and could result in injury of contentsor death property damage loss of strategic capability loss of intellectual property loss of reputation and other significant negative effect product or system failure could lead to negative publicity diversion of management attention and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product and service it could also result in product recall and product liability and warranty claim including claim related to the safety or reliability of our product and related expense other service repair and maintenance cost significant damage and other cost including fine and other remedy and regulatory and environmental liability we may also incur increased cost delayed payment reputational harm or lost equipment or service revenue in connection with significant issue with third party product with which our product are integrated further our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all related cost and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them any of the foregoing could have material adverse effect on our competitive position result of operation financial condition or liquidity we depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel and our failure to attract train and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business due to the specialized nature of our business our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued service of our key technical personnel and executive officer and the hiring development and retention of qualified technical engineering manufacturing marketing sale and management personnel for our operation our defense business in particular requires qualified personnel with security clearance due to our classified program in addition we experienced personnel reduction when the covid pandemic caused significant decline in demand for our commercial aerospace product and service but current demand for our product and service across our business ha created significant need for to hire additional and replacement personnel moreover significant percentage of our current workforce is nearing or eligible for retirement to the extent that we lose experienced personnel in the future it is critical that we develop other employee hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the transfer of knowledge current macroeconomic industry and labor market condition have exacerbated an already highly competitive market for hiring and retaining employee with relevant qualification and experience there is an ongoing labor shortage particularly for highly qualified personnel including engineer skilled laborer and security clearance holder labor market trend also include high attrition and wage inflation and some candidate and new personnel may have different expectation from our current workforce result of the above factor we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant difficulty in hiring and retaining personnel with relevant qualification and experience which ha negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity in addition certain existing personnel may be required to receive various security clearance and substantial training in order to work on certain program or perform certain task necessary security clearance may be delayed which may impact our ability to perform on our government contract we also may not be successful in training or developing qualified personnel with the requisite relevant skill or security clearance loss of key employee increased attrition for various reason failure to adequately train newly hired employee delay in receiving required security clearance or delay in hiring key personnel could also seriously harm our business moreover we believe that critical element of our ability to successfully attract train and retain qualified personnel is our corporate culture which we believe foster innovation collaboration diversity and inclusion and focus on execution all in an environment of high ethical standard our global operation may present challenge in maintaining these important aspect of our corporate culture and failure to maintain our corporate culture could negatively impact further we rely on our key personnel to lead with integrity and to meet our high ethical standard that promote excellent performance and cultivate diversity equity and inclusion to the extent any of our key personnel were to behave in way that is inconsistent with our value including with respect to product safety or quality legal or regulatory compliance financial reporting or people management we could experience materially adverse impact to our reputation and our operating result in addition failure or perceived failure to meet increasing stakeholder expectation on environmental social and governance esg matter could harm our reputation

adversary including nation state which target and other defense contractor we continue to make investment and adopt measure designed to enhance our protection detection response and recovery capability and to mitigate potential risk to our technology product service and operation from potential cybersecurity threat however given the unpredictability nature and scope of cyber attack it is possible that we are unable to defend against all cyber attack that potential vulnerability could go undetected and persist in the environment for an extended period or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer loss and other potential consequence of these attack in addition some product and service that we provide to customer particularly those related to public security may raise potential liability related to privacy and intellectual property in some case we must rely on the safeguard put in place by our customer supplier subcontractor and other third party to protect against

successfully manage our current or future strategic initiative expected efficiency and benefit might be delayed or not realized and our operation and business could be disrupted in addition certain government contract and program have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capability and our inability to achieve these capability with respect to these program timely may result in loss of revenue risk associated with workforce management issue include unfavorable political response to such action unforeseen delay in the implementation of anticipated workforce reduction additional unexpected cost adverse effect on employee morale and the failure to meet operational target due to the loss of employee or work stoppage any of the above factor may impair our ability to

december unless the context otherwise requires the term we our the company raytheon technology and rtc mean raytheon technology corporation and it subsidiary industry considerationsour worldwide operation can be affected by industrial economic and political factor on both regional and global level our operation include original equipment manufacturer oem and extensive related aftermarket part and service related to our aerospace operation our defense business serf both domestic and international customer primarily prime contractor or subcontractor on broad portfolio of defense and related program for government customer our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycle in our commercial aerospace spare contract and certain service contract in our defense business primarily at ri and longer cycle in our aerospace oem and aftermarket maintenance contract and on our defense contract to design develop manufacture or modify complex equipment our customer are in the public and private sector and our business reflect an extensive geographic diversification that ha evolved with continued globalization collins and pratt whitney serve both commercial and government

environment in addition our defense business engage in both direct commercial sale which generally require government license and approval well foreign military sale which are government to government transaction initiated by and carried out at the direction of the government change in these budget and spending level policy or priority which are subject to domestic and foreign geopolitical risk and threat may impact our defense business including the timing of and delay in government license and approval for sale the risk of sanction or other restriction government legislation policy and regulation can impact our business and operation change in environmental and climate change law or regulation including regulation on greenhouse gas emission carbon pricing and energy tax could lead to new or additional investment in product design and facility upgrade and could increase our operational and environmental compliance expenditure including increased energy and raw material cost and cost associated with manufacturing change in addition government and industry driven safety and performance regulation restriction on aircraft engine noise and emission government imposed travel restriction and limitation and government procurement practice can impact our business business environmentglobal economic and political condition change in raw material and commodity price and supply labor availability and cost inflation interest rate international and domestic tax law change foreign currency exchange rate energy cost and of contentssupply level of air travel the financial condition of commercial airline and the impact from natural disaster and weather condition create uncertainty that could impact our business global supply chain and labor market global supply chain and labor market are continuing to experience high level of disruption causing significant material and part shortage including raw material microelectronics and commodity shortage well delivery delay labor shortage distribution problem and price increase current geopolitical condition including sanction and other trade restrictive activity and strained intercountry relation are contributing to these issue we have had difficulty procuring necessary material including raw material component and other supply and service on timely basis or at all we have also had difficulty hiring qualified personnel particularly personnel with specialized engineering experience and security clearance our supplier and subcontractor have been impacted by the issue well ongoing pandemic related issue compounding the shortage for because we rely on them sometimes sole source provider in addition the ongoing recovery in commercial air travel continues the anticipated increase in new aircraft delivery and increased demand for our product and service will add to these supply chain and labor market challenge we work continuously to mitigate the effect of these supply chain and labor constraint through targeted activity and ongoing program we work with our supplier and subcontractor to assist in mitigation arrange supply source alternative increase our inventory of available material and part and regularly pursue cost reduction through number of mechanism we also continuously monitor labor market condition and trend and work to mitigate constraint through talent acquisition partnership sourcing and recruiting arrangement workforce succession planning and initiative to attract retain and rehire former employee coronavirus disease covid pandemic the covid pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy our business and operation the labor market supply chain inflation and the industry in which we operate although we continue to see sign of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel while we believe that the long term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel demand uncertainty continues with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and or exceed pre covid level the pace of the commercial aerospace recovery is tied to general economic condition and may be impacted by inflation an economic downturn or government budget deficit among other factor and may also be impacted by resurgence of the pandemic and corresponding travel restriction and protocol our expectation regarding the covid pandemic and ongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumption that we believe are reasonable at this time however the actual financial impact is highly uncertain and subject to wide range of factor and future development geopolitical matter in response to the russian military invasion of ukraine on february the government and the government of various jurisdiction in which we operate including canada the united kingdom the european union and others have imposed broad economic sanction and export control targeting specific industry entity and individual in russia the russian government ha implemented similar counter sanction and export control targeting specific industry entity and individual in the and other jurisdiction in which we operate including certain member of the company management team and board of director these government measure among other limitation restrict transaction involving various russian bank and financial institution and impose enhanced export control limiting transfer of various good software and technology to and from russia including broadened export control specifically targeting the aerospace sector these measure have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the company and or our supply chain business partner or customer in the quarter ended march we reversed billion of backlog which would have been recognized over span of approximately year and recorded certain impairment charge and increase to reserve related to operation at our pratt whitney and collins business discussed further in note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle within item of this form these adverse impact have been mitigated in part by the identification of alternative supplier and an increase in the global demand for our product result of the current geopolitical environment based on information available to date we do not currently expect these issue will have material adverse effect on our financial result china previously announced that it may take measure against rtc in connection with certain foreign military sale to taiwan in addition china ha indicated that it decided to sanction our chairman and chief executive officer gregory hayes in connection with another potential foreign military sale to taiwan involving rtc product and service rtc is not aware of any specific sanction against mr hayes or rtc or the nature or timing of any future potential sanction or countermeasure if china were to impose sanction or take other regulatory action against rtc our supplier affiliate or partner it could potentially disrupt our business operation the impact of potential sanction or other action by china can not be determined at this time we have direct commercial sale contract for product and service to certain foreign customer for which government review and approval have been pending the government approval of these sale is subject to range of factor including it foreign policy related to these customer which are subject to continuing review and potential change of contentslikewise regulatory approval previously granted for prior sale can be paused or revoked if the product and service have not yet been delivered to the customer if we ultimately do not receive all of the regulatory approval or those approval are revoked it could have material effect on our financial result in particular of december our contract liability include approximately million of advance payment received from middle east customer on contract for which we no longer believe we will be able to execute or obtain required regulatory approval these advance payment may become refundable to the customer if the contract are ultimately terminated see item risk factor within part of this form for further discussion new legislation in august the creating helpful incentive to produce semiconductor chip and science act and the inflation reduction act were signed into law each effective of january these new piece of legislation include the implementation of new corporate alternative minimum tax an excise

contentscritical accounting estimatespreparation of our financial statement requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense management belief the most complex and sensitive judgment because of their significance to the consolidated financial statement result primarily from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain the most significant area involving management judgment and estimate are described below actual result in these area could differ from management estimate long term contract accounting we recognize revenue on an over time basis for substantially all defense contract and certain long term aerospace aftermarket contract we measure progress toward completion of these contract on percentage of completion basis generally using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion contract cost are incurred over period of time which can be several year and the estimation of these cost requires management judgment we review our estimate at completion eacs at least annually or when change in circumstance warrant modification to previous estimate for significant contract we review our eacs more frequently due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company performance obligation the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex subject to many variable and requires significant judgment by management on contract by contract basis part of this process management review information including but not limited to any outstanding key contract matter progress towards completion and the related program schedule identified risk and opportunity and the related change in estimate of revenue and cost the risk and opportunity relate to management judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule consideration of customer directed delay or reduction in scheduled delivery technical requirement customer activity level such flight hour or aircraft landing and related variable consideration management must make assumption and estimate regarding contract revenue and cost including estimate of labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of material including any impact from rising cost or inflation the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractor the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rate and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful life of component among others in particular fixed price development program involve significant management judgment development contract by nature have element that have not been done before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost change cost estimate may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes in the form of either offset obligation or in country industrial participation icip agreement required under certain contract these obligation may or may not be distinct depending on their nature if cash is paid to customer to satisfy our offset obligation it is recorded reduction in the transaction price change in estimate of net sale cost of sale and the related impact to operating profit on contract recognized over time are recognized on cumulative catch up basis which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit change on current and prior period based on performance obligation percentage of completion in the current period significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligation our eac adjustment also include the establishment of and change to loss provision for our contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis net eac adjustment had the following impact on our operating result dollar in million except per share amount net sale operating profit loss income loss from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner amount reflect statutory tax rate of which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustment result of the raytheon merger raytheon company contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the company this had the impact of reducing eac adjustment for these segment in the short term period following the merger most notably in for additional information related to the raytheon merger see note business acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset within item of this form of contentscosts incurred for engineering and development of certain aerospace product under contract with customer are capitalized contract fulfillment cost to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding and subsequently amortized the product are delivered to the customer the estimation of contract cost and margin considered part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment see note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle within item of this form for further discussion we regularly ass capitalized contract fulfillment cost for impairment in we recognized impairment of million related to contract fulfillment cost in conjunction with the related impact of the covid pandemic income tax management belief that our earnings during the period when the temporary difference become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefit which may be realized over an extended period of time for those jurisdiction where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating result indicate that realization is not likely valuation allowance is provided in assessing the need for valuation allowance we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating result projection of future taxable income the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategy and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards our projection of future taxable income include estimate and assumption regarding our volume pricing and cost well the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary difference valuation allowance related to deferred tax asset can be affected by change to tax law change to statutory tax rate and future taxable income level in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or portion of our deferred tax asset in the future we would reduce such amount through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law change are enacted conversely if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax asset in the future in excess of the net carrying amount we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax position significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax position and in determining our tax expense and benefit management ass our tax position based on an evaluation of the fact circumstance applicable tax law including regulation case law and other interpretive guidance well any other relevant information adjustment to our tax position are made new information becomes available or when our assessment change in addition we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transaction necessary to effectuate the separation transaction we have accrued tax on these transaction based on our interpretation of the applicable tax law and our determination of appropriate entity valuation see note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle and note income tax within item of this form for further discussion management ha determined that the distribution of carrier and otis on april and certain related internal business separation transaction qualified tax free under applicable law in making these determination we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdiction to our fact and circumstance and obtained tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority tax opinion and or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment if the completed distribution of carrier or otis in each case or certain internal business separation transaction were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment the company could be subject to significant liability and there could be material adverse impact on the company business result of operation financial condition and liquidity in future reporting period goodwill and intangible asset the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business intangible asset acquired in business combination consist of patent trademark tradenames developed technology customer relationship and other intangible asset the fair value for acquired customer relationship intangible is determined of the acquisition date based on estimate and judgment regarding expectation for the future after tax cash flow arising from the follow on revenue from customer relationship that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated life including the probability of expected future contract renewal and revenue le contributory asset charge all of which is discounted to present value the fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible asset are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is form of the income approach under this method royalty rate based on observed market royalty is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate see note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle within item of this form for further detail also included within intangible asset are exclusivity asset which are payment made to secure certain contractual right to provide product on new commercial aerospace platform at december our exclusivity asset net of accumulated amortization were approximately billion and our remaining estimated commitment net of collaborator share were approximately billion we regularly ass the recoverability of these intangible which is dependent upon our of contentsassumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platform including the associated aftermarket revenue stream and the related future cash flow goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate the asset might be impaired the impairment test compare carrying value of the reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset to their estimated fair value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the carrying value is reduced to fair value in testing our reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessment for the quantitative assessment that are performed for goodwill we utilize combination of discounted cash flow dcf and market based valuation methodology for the quantitative assessment of indefinite lived intangible asset fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method these quantitative assessment incorporate significant assumption that include sale growth rate projected operating profit terminal growth rate discount rate royalty rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry such assumption are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by among other thing global market condition we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing of october and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary for those reporting unit where we performed quantitative test we estimated the fair value of our reporting unit using combination of dcf and market based valuation methodology noted above these methodology involve significant assumption that are subject to variability the key assumption used in our quantitative analysis include our business projection including revenue growth rate and operating profit margin the long term growth rate used to calculate the terminal value of the reporting unit the discount rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry we consider both internal and external factor and refresh key assumption annually or considered necessary material change in these estimate could occur and result in impairment in future period based on our annual impairment analysis of october the reporting unit that were closest to impairment were two previously combined collins reporting unit with fair value in excess of book value including goodwill of and the combined value of goodwill allocated to these two reporting unit is approximately billion of the date testing wa performed all other reporting unit had fair value substantially in excess of book value the company continuously monitor and evaluates relevant event and circumstance that could unfavorably impact the significant assumption noted above including change to treasury rate and equity risk premium tax rate recent market valuation from transaction by comparable company volatility in the company market capitalization and general industry market and macro economic condition it is possible that future change in such circumstance or in the input and assumption used in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit could require the company to record non cash impairment charge in we recognized goodwill impairment of billion related to two collins reporting unit refer to note business acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset within item of this form for additional detail we also completed our annual indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing of october and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of these asset were necessary noted above our indefinite lived intangible asset impairment analysis involves significant assumption that are subject to variability material change in these assumption could occur and result in impairment in future period contingent liability described in note commitment and contingency within item of this form contractual regulatory and other matter in the normal course of business may arise that subject to claim or litigation including with respect to matter relating to technical issue on program government contract performance and operating cost guarantee employee benefit plan legal and environmental health and safety matter in particular the design development production and support of aerospace technology is inherently complex and subject to risk technical issue associated with these technology may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impact including increased warranty provision customer contract settlement and change in contract performance estimate these impact could be material to the company result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally we have significant contract with the government subject to government oversight and audit which may require significant adjustment of contract price we accrue for liability associated with these matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome and the cost associated with these matter requires significant judgment the inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matter could result in amount materially different from any provision made with respect to their resolution employee benefit plan we sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and prb plan assumption used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicator they are evaluated annually at december and when significant event require mid year remeasurement change in any of these assumption of contentsor actual experience that differs from these assumption are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income expense reported in the consolidated financial statement assumption used in the accounting for these employee benefit plan require judgement major assumption include the discount rate and eroa other assumption include mortality rate demographic assumption such retirement age rate of increase in employee compensation level and health care cost increase projection the weighted average discount rate used to measure pension and prb liability are based on yield curve developed using high quality corporate bond which are subject to macroeconomic factor well plan specific expected cash flow for our significant plan we utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost component of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flow the following table show the sensitivity of our pension and prb plan liability and net periodic benefit income to basis point change in the discount rate for benefit obligation interest cost and service cost of december dollar in million increase in discount rate of bpsdecrease in discount rate of bpsprojected benefit obligation increase decrease net periodic benefit income increase decrease the discount rate sensitivity assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflow for future benefit payment in order to calculate interest and service cost flattening of the yield curve result in narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rate and would decrease our net periodic benefit income conversely steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rate and would increase our net periodic benefit income the eroa is the average rate of earnings expected over the long term on asset invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligation in determining the eroa assumption we consider the target asset allocation of plan asset well economic and other indicator of future performance we consult with and consider the opinion of financial and other professional in determining the appropriate capital market assumption return projection are validated using simulation model that incorporates yield curve credit spread and risk premium to project long term prospective return result of this analysis at year end our weighted average pension eroa assumption for increased to difference between actual asset return in given year and the eroa do not necessarily indicate change in the assumption is required the eroa represents the expected average return over long term horizon net periodic benefit income is also sensitive to change in the eroa an increase or decrease of basis point in the eroa would have increased or decreased our net periodic benefit income by approximately million refer to note employee benefit plan within item of this form for discussion of current and prior year

mattersas described above in critical accounting estimate contingent liability our contract with the government are subject to audit such audit may recommend that certain contract price should be reduced to comply with various government regulation or that certain payment be delayed or withheld we are also the subject of one or more investigation and legal proceeding initiated by the government with respect to government contract matter see note commitment and contingency within item of this form for further discussion of these and other government matter of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskour primary market exposure are to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate it relates to our market risk sensitive instrument which are primarily cash debt and derivative instrument to quantify our market risk exposure we perform sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate refer to note basis of presentation and summary of accounting principle note borrowing and line of credit and note financial instrument within item of this form for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange interest rate and financial instrument foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipt from customer and payment to supplier in foreign currency and to various internal or external financing arrangement we use foreign currency forward contract to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payment and receipt related to our ongoing business and financing we actively manage foreign currency exposure that are associated with committed foreign currency purchase and sale and other asset and liability created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level more than insignificant exposure that can not be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivative foreign exchange exposure arising from intercompany loan and deposit transaction are also hedged regularly the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge wa billion and billion at december and respectively foreign currency forward contract are sensitive to change in foreign currency exchange rate unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contract would have resulted in an increase in unrealized loss of billion and billion at december and respectively such loss or gain would be offset by corresponding gain or loss in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged we believe these foreign currency forward exchange contract and the offsetting underlying commitment when taken together do not create material market risk within our aerospace business our sale are typically denominated in dollar however for our non based entity such pratt whitney canada wc substantial portion of their cost are incurred in local currency consequently there is foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational result dollar must be converted to local currency such the canadian dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligation additionally we transact business in various foreign currency which expose our cash flow and earnings to change in foreign currency exchange rate in order to minimize the exposure that exists from change in the exchange rate of the dollar against these other currency we hedge certain portion of sale to secure the rate at which dollar will be converted the majority of this hedging activity occurs at wc and collins and hedging activity also occurs to lesser extent at the remainder of pratt whitney at wc and collins firm and forecasted sale for both original equipment and spare part are hedged at varying amount for up to month on the dollar sale exposure represented by the excess of dollar sale over dollar denominated purchase hedging gain and loss resulting from movement in foreign currency exchange rate are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impact that are generated on the translation of local currency operating result into dollar for reporting purpose while the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating result there are typically variance between the hedging gain or loss and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contract change in the sale profile volatility in the exchange rate and other such operational consideration interest rate risk we have financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally fixed rate debt obligation basis point unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate billion and billion impact on the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december and the investor in our fixed rate debt obligation generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligation prior to maturity therefore we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed rate debt is not material from time to time we may hedge to floating rate using interest rate swap currently we do not hold any derivative contract that hedge our interest exposure but may consider such strategy in the future of contentsitem financial statement and supplementary

unprecedented downturn government business and individual reacted to the pandemic in way such lockdown quarantine border closing and other travel restriction and requirement the adoption of remote working and decreased leisure travel the unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customer and their demand for our product and service of our collins and pratt whitney business in addition the border closing lockdown and labor shortage resulting from covid negatively impacted global supply and distribution capability decrease in the availability of supply increase in the cost of supply and delivery issue have caused shortage and delay for the procurement of raw material component and other supply required for our performance although we continue to see sign of ongoing recovery in commercial air travel while we believe that the long term outlook for the aerospace industry remains positive due to the fundamental driver of air travel demand uncertainty continues with respect to when commercial air traffic capacity will fully return to and or exceed pre covid level the pace of the commercial aerospace recovery is tied to general economic condition and may be impacted by inflation an economic downturn or government budget deficit among other factor and may also be impacted by resurgence of the pandemic and corresponding travel restriction and protocol our expectation regarding the covid pandemic and of contentsongoing recovery and their potential financial impact are based on available information and assumption that we

classification the consolidated financial statement include the account of raytheon technology corporation and all wholly owned majority owned and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiary all intercompany transaction have been eliminated for our consolidated non wholly owned subsidiary noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of equity that is not attributable to for classification of certain current asset and liability the duration of our contract or program is utilized to define our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year included within our current asset and liability are contract asset and liability related to our aftermarket and development arrangement which can generally span up to fifteen year we reclassified certain immaterial prior period amount within the consolidated statement of cash flow to conform to our current period presentation use of estimate our consolidated financial statement are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principle gaap which require to make estimate and assumption about future event that affect the amount reported in our consolidated financial statement and the accompanying note actual result could differ from those estimate and any such difference may be material to our consolidated financial statement estimate and assumption are reviewed periodically and the effect of change if any are reflected in our consolidated financial statement in the period they are determined cash and cash equivalent cash and cash equivalent includes cash on hand demand deposit and short term cash investment that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturity of three month or le the estimated fair value of cash and cash equivalent approximates the carrying value due to their short maturity account receivable account receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected we are exposed to credit loss primarily on our account receivable and contract asset related to our sale of product and service to commercial customer the allowance for expected credit loss is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit loss by evaluating factor such customer creditworthiness historical payment and loss experience current economic condition including geographic and political risk and the age and status of outstanding receivables in certain circumstance we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecast over the contractual term of the financial asset for period beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecast we revert to historical loss experience and information we determine credit rating for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customer we conduct review of customer credit rating published historical credit default rate for different rating category and multiple third party aircraft value publication basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for expected credit loss on quarterly basis or when event and circumstance warrant credit limit is established for each of contentscustomer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factor discussed above in certain case we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk expected credit loss are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible unbilled receivables represent revenue that are not currently billable to the customer under the term of the contract and include unbilled amount under commercial contract where payment is solely subject to the passage of time these item are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business account receivable of december and includes unbilled receivables of million and million respectively which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customer other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factor beyond the passage of time are included in contract asset in the consolidated balance sheet contract asset and liability contract asset and liability represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our customer contract asset reflect revenue recognized and performance obligation satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing contract liability relate to payment received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract we receive payment from customer based on the term established in our contract contract asset and contract liability are generally classified current our operating cycle is generally longer than one year see note contract asset and liability for further discussion of contract asset and liability described in more detail above in account receivable we are exposed to credit loss on our contract asset related to our sale of product and service to commercial customer and regularly ass our allowance for expected credit loss it relates to our contract asset inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first in first out fifo or average cost method valuation reserve for excess obsolete and slow moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory level of individual part to both future sale forecast or production requirement and historical usage rate in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is le than inventoriable cost other factor that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserve include whether individual inventory part meet current specification and can be substituted for part currently being sold or used service part overall market condition and other inventory management initiative manufacturing cost are allocated to current production contract in our commercial aerospace business excess cost beyond standard manufacturing cost are expensed when they meet certain threshold equity investment investment in entity we do not control are included in other asset on the consolidated balance sheet for investment where we have significant influence we apply the equity method of accounting and such our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is recorded for investment where we do not have significant influence we record them at cost under the measurement alternative and record adjustment for observable price change equity investment income and loss are included in other income net on the consolidated statement of operation since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with our operation we evaluate our equity investment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period our sale to and purchase from unconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method which are considered related party are not material customer financing asset customer financing asset cfa relate to our commercial aerospace business in which we provide financing to airline customer our financing predominantly relates to product under lease and to lesser extent note and lease receivables in certain limited circumstance we pay deposit on behalf of our airline customer to secure production slot with the airframers and such pre delivery payment are included in account receivable net if current and customer financing asset if non current in our consolidated balance sheet any unfunded pre delivery payment are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitment further discussed in note commitment and contingency interest income from note and financing lease and rental income from operating lease asset is generally included in other income net in the consolidated statement of operation while gain or loss on sale of operating lease asset are included in product sale and cost of sale the current portion of these financing arrangement are aggregated in account receivable net and the non current portion of these financing arrangement are aggregated in cfa in the consolidated balance sheet the increase and decrease in cfa from funding receipt and certain other activity are generally reflected investing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow leased asset are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable note and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected for note and lease receivables we determine specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with of contentsthe evaluation of credit risk and collectability of december and the reserve related to cfa were not material at december and we did not have any significant balance that are considered to be delinquent on non accrual status past due day or more or considered to be impaired fixed asset net fixed asset net are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation major improvement are capitalized while expenditure for maintenance repair and minor improvement are expensed for asset sale or retirement the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the account gain and loss on sale of our fixed asset net are generally recorded in operating income business combination business is acquired the fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill required preliminary fair value is determined once business is acquired with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition in connection with the acquisition of rockwell collins in and goodrich in and to lesser extent the acquisition of raytheon company in we recorded assumed liability related to customer contractual obligation on certain contract with economic return that were lower than could be realized in market transaction of the acquisition date we measured these assumed liability based on the estimated cash flow of the program plus reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contract to market participant these liability are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligation reflected by the expense incurred on the contract the balance of the contractual obligation wa million and million at december and respectively total consumption of the contractual obligation for the year ended december and wa million million and million respectively with future consumption expected to be follows million in million in million in million in million in and million thereafter goodwill and intangible asset goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying net asset of acquired business goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate the asset might be impaired the goodwill impairment test compare carrying value of the reporting unit to their estimated fair value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value in developing our estimate for the fair value of our reporting unit and indefinite lived intangible asset significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment for the quantitative assessment that are performed fair value is primarily based on market based valuation method income based method using discounted cash flow model relief from royalty method or combination of such these assessment utilize significant assumption including sale growth rate projected operating profit terminal growth rate discount rate royalty rate and comparable multiple from publicly traded company in our industry such assumption are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by among other thing global market condition finite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment when event occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flow intangible asset consist of patent trademark tradenames customer relationship exclusivity asset developed technology and other intangible asset including collaboration asset acquired intangible asset are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting finite lived intangible asset are amortized to cost of sale and selling general and administrative expense over the applicable useful life exclusivity asset are commercial aerospace payment made to secure certain contractual right to provide product on new aircraft platform we classify amortization of such payment reduction of sale such payment are capitalized when there are distinct right obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flow to support the recoverability of the asset established otherwise the applicable portion of the payment are expensed in addition in connection with our agreement to acquire roll royce ownership and collaboration interest in international aero engine ag iae additional payment are due to roll royce contingent upon each hour flown through june by the powered aircraft in service of the acquisition date these flight hour payment are being capitalized collaboration asset and amortized to cost of sale useful life of finite lived intangible asset are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and the industry in which the intangible asset is used these intangible asset are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the intangible asset are consumed represented by the underlying cash flow which may result in an amortization method other than straight line for both our commercial aerospace collaboration asset and exclusivity arrangement the pattern of economic benefit generally result in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning program enter full rate production and aftermarket cycle if pattern of economic benefit can not be reliably determined or if straight of contentsline amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit straight line amortization method may be used the range of estimated useful life is follows yearscollaboration relationship and related to to and to to lessee we record right of use asset and lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet for lease with term longer than month lease are classified either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated statement of operation we enter into lease agreement for the use of real estate space vehicle information technology equipment and certain other equipment under both operating and finance lease we determine if an arrangement contains lease at inception operating lease are included in operating lease right of use asset and operating lease liability non current on our consolidated balance sheet the current portion of our operating lease liability is included in accrued liability on our consolidated balance sheet finance lease are not considered significant to our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of operation right of use asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease lease right of use asset and liability are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payment and use the implicit rate when readily determinable we determine our incremental borrowing rate through market source including relevant industry rate our lease right of use asset also include any initial direct cost and lease pre payment made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentive received at or before the commencement date certain of our lease include variable payment which may vary based upon change in fact or circumstance after the start of the lease we exclude variable payment from lease right of use asset and lease liability to the extent such payment are not considered fixed and instead expense variable payment incurred variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contract are not material component of lease expense some of our lease include the option to extend or terminate the lease we include these option in the recognition of our right of use asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option lease expense is generally recognized on straight line basis over the lease term in limited instance we act lessor primarily for commercial aerospace engine the majority of which are classified operating lease these lease are not significant to our consolidated balance sheet or consolidated statement of operation other long lived asset we evaluate the potential impairment of other long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the related carrying amount may not be recoverable if the carrying value of other long lived asset held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flow the carrying value is written down to fair value in order for long lived asset to be considered held for disposal we must have committed to plan to dispose of the asset once deemed held for disposal the asset are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value income tax future income tax represent the tax effect of transaction which are reported in different period for tax and financial reporting purpose these amount consist of the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax and financial reporting balance sheet and tax carryforwards future income tax benefit and payable within the same tax paying component of particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the consolidated balance sheet in the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax position we ass our income tax position and record tax benefit for all year subject to examination based upon management evaluation of the fact circumstance and information available at the reporting date for those tax position where it is more likely than not that tax benefit will be sustained we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information for those income tax position where it is not more likely than not that tax benefit will be sustained no tax benefit ha been recognized in the financial statement where applicable associated interest expense ha also been recognized we recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefit in interest expense penalty if incurred would be recognized component of income tax expense state income tax amount are generally included in income tax expense however state income tax payment related to our raytheon intelligence space ri and raytheon missile defense rmd segment are generally recoverable through the pricing of product and of contentsservices to the government and accordingly we have recorded the future recovery of these cost from the government within other asset current in the consolidated balance sheet accordingly these state income tax are generally allocated to contract and then classified selling general and administrative expense when paid recovered or otherwise agreed allocable with the government we have elected to account for tax on global intangible low taxed income gilti period cost incurred revenue recognition the vast majority of our revenue are from long term contract associated with the design development manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related service collins and pratt whitney primarily serve commercial and government customer in both the original equipment manufacturer oem and aftermarket part and service market of the aerospace industry while ri and rmd primarily provide product and service to government customer in the defense industry we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable for certain contract that meet the foregoing requirement primarily contract that are directly with foreign government we are required to obtain certain regulatory approval in these case we recognize revenue based on the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval based upon all known fact and circumstance performance obligation is promise in contract with customer to transfer distinct good or service to the customer some of our contract with customer contain single performance obligation while others contain multiple performance obligation most commonly when contract contains multiple distinct unit such engine or certain aerospace component or span multiple phase of the product life cycle such production maintenance and support contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied when there are multiple performance obligation within contract we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on it standalone selling price when available if standalone selling price is not available we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation which is generally based on an expected cost plus margin approach we consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and ass variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price including contractual discount contract incentive payment estimate of award fee flight hour aircraft landing or other customer usage activity on long term maintenance contract and other source of variable consideration when determining the transaction price of each contract when reasonably able to estimate we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved these estimate are based on historical experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time we also consider whether our contract contain significant financing component which they generally do not timing of the satisfaction of performance obligation varies across our business due to our diverse product and service mix customer base and contractual term performance obligation are satisfied of point in time for certain aerospace component engine and spare part revenue is recognized when control of the product transfer to the customer generally upon product shipment since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment we generally do not have contract asset or contract liability balance related to point in time sale performance obligation are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefit we perform work if the customer control the asset it is being produced continuous transfer of control or if the product being produced for the customer ha no alternative use and we have contractual right to payment for performance to date we recognize revenue on an over time basis for substantially all defense contract and certain long term aerospace oem and aftermarket contract substantially all of our defense business revenue which primarily relates to our ri and rmd segment and to lesser extent pratt whitney and collins is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customer for performance obligation satisfied over time revenue is recognized on percentage of completion basis generally using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress incurred cost represent work performed which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer contract cost can include labor material subcontractor cost or other direct cost and indirect cost our contract with the government are typically subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and are priced based on estimated or actual cost of producing good or providing service the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service provided under government contract the pricing for non government contract is based on the specific negotiation with each customer under the typical payment term of our government fixed price contract the customer pay either performance based payment pbps or progress payment pbps are interim payment equal to negotiated percentage of the of contentscontract price based on quantifiable measure of performance or on the achievement of specified event or milestone progress payment are interim payment up to of cost incurred the work progress because the customer retains portion of the contract price until completion of the contract our government fixed price contract generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billing which we present contract asset on the consolidated balance sheet for our government cost type contract the customer generally pay for our cost incurred within short period of time for non government contract we typically receive interim payment work progress although for some contract we may be entitled to receive an advance payment such advance are not considered significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demand that can be higher in the early stage of contract and to protect from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of it obligation under the contract we recognize liability for advance payment in excess of revenue recognized and present it contract liability on the consolidated balance sheet for certain of our long term aftermarket contract revenue is recognized over the contract period we generally account for such contract series of daily performance obligation to stand ready to provide spare part product maintenance and aftermarket service these arrangement include the sale of spare part with integral service to our customer and are generally classified service sale with the corresponding cost classified in cost of sale service within the consolidated statement of operation revenue is primarily recognized on percentage of completion basis using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing service under the contract is incurred on an other than straight line basis for some of our long term aftermarket contract we receive payment prior to delivery of product and service resulting in contract liability balance while for others we deliver product or service in advance of payment resulting in contract asset balance contract are often modified to account for change in contract specification or requirement we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new or change existing enforceable right and obligation contract modification for good or service that are not distinct are accounted for part of the existing contract either on cumulative catch up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification loss provision on contract are recognized to the extent that estimated contract cost exceed the estimated consideration from the product or service contemplated under the contractual arrangement for new commitment we generally record loss provision at contract signing except for certain contract under which loss are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates to perform for existing commitment anticipated loss on contractual arrangement are recognized in the period in which loss become evident in estimating loss product contemplated under contractual arrangement include firm quantity of product sold under contract and in the commercial engine and wheel and brake business future highly probable sale of replacement part required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment in our commercial engine and wheel and brake business when the oem product is sold for loss but the combined oem and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sale campaign is profitable we record oem product loss at the time of product delivery we review our estimate at completion eacs at least annually or when change in circumstance warrant modification to previous estimate for significant contract we review our eacs more frequently due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the company performance obligation the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex subject to many variable and requires significant judgment by management on contract by contract basis part of this process management review information including but not limited to any outstanding key contract matter progress towards completion and the related program schedule identified risk and opportunity and the related change in estimate of revenue and cost the risk and opportunity relate to management judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule consideration of customer directed delay or reduction in scheduled delivery technical requirement customer activity level such flight hour or aircraft landing and related variable consideration management must make assumption and estimate regarding contract revenue and cost including estimate of labor productivity and availability the complexity and scope of the work to be performed the availability and cost of material including any impact from rising cost or inflation the length of time to complete the performance obligation execution by our subcontractor the availability and timing of funding from our customer overhead cost rate and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful life of component among others in particular fixed price development program involve significant management judgment development contract by nature have element that have not been done before and thus are highly subject to future unexpected cost change cost estimate may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes in the form of either offset obligation or in country industrial participation icip agreement required under certain contract these obligation may or may not be distinct depending on their nature if cash is paid to customer to satisfy our offset obligation it is recorded reduction in the transaction price change in estimate of net sale cost of sale and the related impact to operating profit on contract recognized over time are recognized on cumulative catch up basis which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit change on current and prior period based on performance obligation percentage of completion in the current period significant change in one or of contentsmore of these estimate could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligation our eac adjustment also include the establishment of and change to loss provision for our contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis net eac adjustment had the following impact on our operating result dollar in million except per share amount net sale operating profit loss income loss from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner diluted earnings loss per share from continuing operation attributable to common shareowner amount reflect statutory tax rate of which approximates our tax rate on our eac adjustment for additional discussion on significant unfavorable eac adjustment in see the covid pandemic discussion above result of the raytheon merger raytheon company contract accounted for on percentage of completion basis were reset to zero percent complete of the merger date because only the unperformed portion of the contract at the merger date represented the obligation of the company this had the impact of reducing eac adjustment for these segment in the short term period following the merger most notably in for additional information related to the raytheon merger see note business acquisition disposition goodwill and intangible asset in our collins and pratt whitney business

our performance obligation under these contract we capitalize these cost contract fulfillment cost to the extent the cost are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding and subsequently amortize the cost the related performance obligation are satisfied in instance where intellectual property doe not transfer to the customer we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligation are satisfied capitalized contract fulfillment cost were billion and billion of december and respectively and are classified in other asset current in our consolidated balance sheet and are included in other current asset in our consolidated statement of cash flow we regularly ass capitalized contract fulfillment cost for impairment and recognized million of impairment for contract fulfillment cost in in conjunction with the related impact of the covid pandemic cost to obtain contract are not material in view of the risk and cost associated with developing new engine and the large up front investment required that often require return generated over the full estimated life of the engine pratt whitney ha entered into certain collaboration arrangement in which sale cost and risk are shared sale generated from engine program spare part sale and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangement are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policy in our consolidated financial statement amount attributable to our collaborator for their share of sale are recorded cost of sale in our consolidated financial statement based upon the term and nature of the arrangement cost associated with engine program under collaborative arrangement are expensed incurred under these arrangement collaborator contribute their program share of engine part incur their own production cost and make certain payment for shared or joint program cost the reimbursement from collaborator of their share of program cost is recorded reduction of the related expense item at that time of december the collaborator interest in all commercial engine program ranged from to inclusive of portion of pratt whitney interest held by other participant pratt whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangement with the exception of the engine alliance ea joint venture with ge aviation which provides aftermarket support spare part and service for the engine for the airbus aircraft there are no individually significant collaborative arrangement and

concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties while there can be no assurance we do not anticipate any material non performance by any of these counterparties we enter into transaction that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement with various counterparties however we have not elected to offset multiple contract with single counterparty and result the fair

liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available fact with respect to each individual site including existing technology current law and regulation and prior remediation experience where no amount within range of estimate is more likely the minimum is accrued for site with multiple responsible party we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation cost and the ability of the other party to fulfill their obligation in establishing provision for those cost liability with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payment are discounted portion of these cost is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our product and service to the government we regularly ass the probability of recovery of these cost which requires to make assumption about the extent of cost recovery under our contract and the amount of future contract activity with the government we consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulation and our history of receiving reimbursement for such cost and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these cost from the government within other asset current in the consolidated balance sheet accrued environmental liability are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursement or potential recovery from pursuing other party we also lease certain government owned property and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these site result we generally do

major assumption include the discount rate and expected return on plan asset eroa these gain or loss are recorded in other comprehensive income net of tax effect until they are amortized component of net periodic benefit income expense calculated market related value of our plan asset is used to develop the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized the market related value of asset is equal to the fair value of asset adjusted to reflect the recognition and subsequent amortization of the difference between actual and expected asset return over five year period the market related value of asset is used to calculate the expected return on asset included in the net periodic benefit income expense the company ha elected to use the corridor approach in the amortization of gain and loss which limit the expense recognition to the net outstanding gain and loss in excess of the greater of of the pbo or of the market related value of asset gain and loss exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit income expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participant depending on the plan net periodic benefit income expense is classified between operating and non operating whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining component are included in non service pension income expense product performance obligation we extend performance and operating cost guarantee beyond our normal service and warranty policy for extended period on some of our product particularly commercial aircraft engine liability under such guarantee is based upon future product performance and durability we accrue for such cost that are probable and can be reasonably estimated in addition we incur discretionary cost to service our product in connection with product performance issue the cost associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantee require estimate over the full term of the agreement and require management to consider factor such the extent of future maintenance requirement interval between flight and repair time and the future cost of material and labor to perform the service these cost estimate are largely based upon historical experience see note guarantee for further discussion government grant we may receive

transferred were primarily international plan with the majority of the utc defined benefit liability remaining with raytheon technology upon separation the pension participant within carrier and otis were effectively terminated from raytheon technology the termination triggered mid year remeasurement of the utc domestic plan the remeasurement which wa calculated using discount rate and asset value of april using march practical expedient resulted in billion increase to our pension liability primarily due to decrease in the fair market value of the plan asset since december all service cost previously associated with carrier and otis wa reclassified to discontinued operation for non service pension income expense and pension liability generally only the portion related to the defined benefit plan transferred to carrier and otis part of the separation transaction were reclassified to discontinued operation the fair value of the customer relationship intangible asset were determined by using discounted cash flow valuation method which is form of the income approach under this approach the estimated future cash flow attributable to the asset are adjusted to exclude the future cash

market participant future cash flow which required significant management judgment included forecasted revenue growth rate remaining developmental effort operational performance including company specific synergy program life cycle material and labor pricing and other relevant customer contractual and market factor where appropriate the net cash flow were probability adjusted to reflect the uncertainty associated with the underlying assumption including cancellation rate related to backlog government demand for sole source and recompete contract and win rate for recompete contract well the risk profile of the net cash flow utilized in the valuation the probability adjusted future cash flow were then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate that required significant judgment by management the customer relationship intangible asset are being amortized based on the pattern of economic benefit we expect to realize over the estimated economic life of the underlying program the fair value of the tradename intangible asset were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is form of the income approach under this method royalty rate based on observed market royalty is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using forecasted revenue growth rate projection and discount rate respectively that

year to complete the government also reserve the right to debar contractor from receiving new government contract for fraudulent criminal or other seriously improper conduct the government could void any contract found to be tainted by fraud like many defense contractor we have received audit report recommending the reduction of certain contract price because for example cost or pricing data or cost accounting practice used to price and negotiate those contract may not have conformed to government regulation some of these audit report recommend that certain payment be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amount we have made voluntary refund in those case we believe appropriate have settled some allegation and in some case continue to negotiate and or litigate the company may be and in some case ha been required to make payment into escrow of disputed liability while the related litigation is pending if the litigation is resolved in the company favor any such payment will be returned to the company with interest our final allowable incurred cost for each year are also subject to audit and have from time to time resulted in dispute between and the government with litigation resulting at the court of federal claim cofc or the armed service board of contract appeal asbca or their related court of appeal in addition the doj ha from time to time convened grand jury to investigate possible irregularity by we also provide product and service to customer outside of the and those sale are subject to local government law regulation and procurement policy and practice our compliance with such local government regulation or any applicable government regulation the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and international traffic in arm regulation itar may also be investigated or audited in addition we accrue for liability associated with those matter that are probable and can be reasonably estimated the most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon range of estimate where no amount within range of estimate is more likely then we accrue the minimum amount other than specifically disclosed in this form we do not expect these audit investigation or dispute to have material effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity either individually or in the aggregate tax treatment of carrier and otis disposition management ha determined that the distribution of carrier and otis on april and certain related internal business separation transaction qualified tax free under applicable law in making these determination we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdiction to our fact and circumstance and obtained tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority tax opinion and or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment if the completed distribution of carrier or otis or certain internal business separation transaction were to fail to qualify for tax free treatment the company could be subject to significant liability and there could be material adverse impact on the company business result of operation financial condition or liquidity in future reporting period legal proceeding the company and it subsidiary are subject to various contract pricing dispute government investigation and litigation matter across jurisdiction update to certain of which are set forth below cost accounting standard claimsas previously disclosed in april divisional administrative contracting officer daco of the united state dcma asserted claim against pratt whitney to recover alleged overpayment of approximately billion plus interest million at december the claim is based on pratt whitney alleged noncompliance with cost accounting standard ca from january to march due to it method of allocating independent research and development cost to government contract pratt whitney belief that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the asbca on june previously disclosed in december dcma daco asserted claim against pratt whitney to recover alleged overpayment of approximately million plus interest million at december the claim is based on pratt whitney alleged noncompliance with ca from january to december due to it method of determining the cost of collaborator part used in the calculation of material overhead cost for government contract in pratt whitney filed an appeal to the asbca an evidentiary hearing wa held and completed in june on november the asbca issued it written decision sustaining in part and denying in part pratt whitney appeal the asbca rejected the dcma asserted measure of the cost of collaborator part and ruled substantially in pratt whitney favor on other liability issue the asbca remanded the appeal to the party for resolution of damage issue which could require further proceeding at the asbca on december the dcma filed motion with the asbca seeking partial reconsideration of the november decision the motion for reconsideration wa denied on august on december the dcma filed an appeal to the united state court of appeal for the federal circuit we continue to believe that the of contentsasbca rejection of the dcma asserted measure of the cost of collaborator part is well supported in fact and law and likely will be sustained in december dcma daco issued second claim against pratt whitney that similarly alleges that it method of determining the cost of collaborator part doe not comply with the ca for calendar year through this second claim which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator part rejected by the asbca recent decision demand payment of million plus interest million at december pratt whitney appealed this second claim to the asbca in january although subject to further litigation at the asbca and potentially further litigation at the asbca and potentially further appellate proceeding we continue to believe that the november decision in the first claim will apply with equal legal effect to the second claim accordingly we believe that the amount demanded by the dcma set forth in the two claim are without legal basis and that any damage owed to the government for the two claim will not have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity thales raytheon system and related mattersas previously disclosed in raytheon company received subpoena from the security and exchange commission sec seeking information in connection with an investigation into whether there were improper payment made by raytheon company our joint venture known thales raytheon system trs or anyone acting on their behalf in connection with trs or raytheon company contract in certain middle east country since in the first quarter of the doj advised raytheon company it had opened parallel criminal investigation in the third quarter of raytheon company received an additional subpoena from the sec seeking information and document part of it ongoing investigation the company maintains rigorous anti corruption compliance program and continues to cooperate fully with the sec and doj inquiry and to examine through our own investigation whether there were any improper payment or any such conduct that wa in violation of raytheon company policy at this time the company is unable to predict the outcome of the sec or doj inquiry based on the information available to date however we can not reasonably estimate the range of any potential loss or impact to the business that may result but do not believe that the result of these inquiry will have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity doj investigation contract pricing dispute and related civil litigation previously disclosed on october the company received criminal subpoena from the doj seeking information and document in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting internal control over financial reporting and

pricing claim for three rmd contract entered into between and part of the same investigation on march the company received second criminal subpoena from the doj seeking document relating to different rmd contract entered into in we are cooperating fully with and will continue to review the issue raised by the doj ongoing investigation we continue to make substantial progress in our internal review of the issue raised by the doj investigation although we believe we have defense to the potential claim the company ha determined that there is probable risk of liability for damage interest and potential penalty and ha accrued approximately million for this matter we are currently unable to estimate an incremental loss if any which may result when the doj investigation is complete based on the information available to date we do not believe the result of the doj investigation or of any pending or potential civil litigation will have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity four shareholder lawsuit were filed against the company after the doj investigation wa first disclosed putative security class action lawsuit wa filed in the united state district court for the district of arizona against the company and certain of it executive alleging that the defendant violated federal security law by making material misstatement in regulatory

former raytheon company board of director the company and certain of it executive each alleging that defendant violated federal security law and breached their fiduciary duty by engaging in improper accounting practice failing to implement sufficient internal financial and compliance control and making series of false and misleading statement in regulatory filing we believe that each of these lawsuit lack merit darnis et al and related matteras previously disclosed on august several former employee of utc or it subsidiary filed putative class action complaint in the united state district

the equity compensation plan against the company otis and carrier but no longer asserts erisa claim further no claim is made in the amended complaint against any current or former director of any of the three company plaintiff seek money damage attorney fee and other relief on september in response to motion to dismiss filed by the company otis and carrier the court dismissed the class action in it entirety with prejudice on october plaintiff filed an appeal to the united state court of appeal for the second circuit we continue to believe that this matter will not have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition or liquidity on december shareholder derivative lawsuit wa filed in the delaware court of chancery against the company and certain current and former member of it board of director alleging that defendant breached their fiduciary duty in may by amending the method by which utc equity award were converted to certain company equity award following the separation of utc into three independent publicly traded company we believe that the lawsuit lack merit doj grand jury investigation and related civil litigationthe company received grand jury subpoena in late part of doj criminal investigation into purported agreement not to solicit or hire employee in violation of the federal antitrust law while the investigation ha focused on alleged hiring restriction between and among pratt whitney and certain of it supplier of outsourced engineering service the subpoena also included request regarding collins since receipt of the subpoena the

affiliate after the criminal charge against the individual were filed numerous civil class action antitrust lawsuit have been filed against pratt whitney and other corporate and individual defendant in the united state district court for the district of connecticut the allegation in each of the civil lawsuit track the factual assertion in the criminal indictment and generally allege that pratt whitney and the other defendant agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineer and skilled laborer in manner that violated federal antitrust law plaintiff in each of the civil lawsuit seek to represent different purported class of engineer and skilled laborer employed by pratt whitney and other supplier defendant since plaintiff in each of the lawsuit seek treble damage in an undetermined amount plus attorney fee and cost of suit all of the lawsuit have been consolidated and single amended class action complaint wa filed we believe that the claim asserted lack merit
