emergence of new variant impact to the labor market supply chain disruption and inflation and the impact of the pandemic may continue even the pandemic subsides the extent to which our business and

disruption to the global supply chain and the availability of certain natural resource and other adverse effect on macroeconomic condition hurricane and other natural disaster have impacted spending

business result of operation and infrastructure including our technology and system climate change may exacerbate certain of these threat including the frequency and severity of weather related event card member in california new york florida texas georgia and new jersey account for significant portion of consumer and small business billed business and card member loan and our result of operation could be impacted by event or condition that disproportionately or specifically affect one or more of those state our operating result may materially suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payment industry the payment industry is highly competitive and we compete with card network issuer and acquirer paper based transaction cash and check bank transfer model wire transfer and ach well evolving and growing alternative payment and financing provider if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor develop compelling value proposition for our customer and or effectively grow in area such mobile and online payment and emerging technology we may not be able to compete effectively we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most country based on purchase volume result card issuer and acquirer on the visa and mastercard network may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resource marketing and pricing of those network our business may also be negatively affected if we are unable to continue increasing merchant acceptance including by merchant that accept card on the visa and mastercard network and perception of coverage or if our card member do not experience welcome acceptance of our card some of our competitor have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have and may offer richer value proposition or wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective strategy to acquire and retain more customer capture greater share of spending and borrowing develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner program and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have government action or initiative may also provide competitor with increased opportunity to derive competitive advantage and may create new competitor including in some case government entity we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat or respond or adapt to change in consumer spending and borrowing habit effectively our competitor cost such card member reward and card member service expense could continue to increase we evolve our value proposition including in response to increased competition spending on our card could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of credit and debit card issued on other network well adoption of alternative payment mechanism system and product the fragmentation of customer spending to take advantage of different merchant or card incentive or for convenience with technological solution may continue to increase revolving credit balance on our card could also be impacted by alternative financing provider such point of sale lender and buy now pay later product to the extent other payment and financing mechanism system and product continue to successfully expand our discount revenue earned from card member spending and our net interest income earned from card member borrowing could be negatively impacted in addition company that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choice at the point of sale or through digital wallet commerce related experience mobile application or other technology could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our product or could restrict our access to our customer and transaction data such company could also require payment from to participate in such digital wallet experience or application or negotiate incentive or pricing concession impacting our profitability on transaction the competitive value of our closed loop data and demand for our product and service may also be diminished traditional and non traditional competitor use other new data source and technology to derive similar insight and by certain regulation such open banking initiative which may result in disintermediating existing financial service provider steering customer away from our product and service or decreasing our attractiveness to partner to the extent we expand into or further grow in new business area and new geographic region such mainland china we will face competitor with more experience and more established relationship with relevant customer regulator and industry participant which could adversely affect our ability to compete law and business practice that favor local competitor require card transaction to be routed over domestic network or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain business could limit our growth in international region we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business area and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resource to comply with regulatory requirement than our competitor particularly those that are not regulated financial institution of contentsmany of our competitor are subject to different and in some case le stringent legislative and regulatory regime and some may have lower cost structure and more agile business model and system more restrictive law and regulation that do not apply to all of our competitor can put at disadvantage including prohibiting from engaging in certain transaction regulating our business practice or adversely affecting our cost structure we face intense competition for partner relationship which could result in loss or renegotiation of these arrangement that could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different type of contractual arrangement with business partner in variety of industry for example we have partnered with delta marriott hilton and british airway well many others globally to offer cobranded card for consumer and small business and through our membership reward program we have partnered with business in many industry including delta and others in the airline industry to offer benefit to card member participant see partner and relationship under business for additional information on our business partnership including with delta competition for relationship with key business partner is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationship or that they will remain profitable or valued by our customer establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnership is particularly competitive among card issuer and network these partnership typically appeal to high spending loyal customer all of our cobrand portfolio in the aggregate accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide network volume for the year ended december card member loan related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide card member loan of december cobrand arrangement are entered into for fixed period generally ranging from five to ten year and will terminate in accordance with their term including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the party or upon early termination result of an event of default or otherwise we face the risk that we could lose partner relationship even after we have invested significant resource in the relationship we may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationship network volume could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationship in addition some of our cobrand arrangement provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate third party to purchase the loan generated with respect to it program which could result in the loss of the card account and significant decline in our card member loan outstanding we regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangement in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationship will be renegotiated with le favorable term for or that we may be unable to renegotiate on term that are acceptable to competition for such relationship continues to increase we make payment to our cobrand partner which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding reward earned on such spending and under certain arrangement on the number of account acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partner ha increased particularly in the united state and may continue to increase arrangement are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partner among card issuer and network the loss of exclusivity arrangement with business partner the loss of the partner relationship altogether whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such the end of our relationship with costco in the united state in or the result of merger legal or regulatory action or otherwise such the withdrawal of american airline in from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card member or the renegotiation of existing partnership with term that are significantly worse for could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation see our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationship in the eu in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partner could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card member and merchant and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partner arrangement with our business partner represent significant portion of our business we are exposed to risk associated with our business partner including reputational issue business slowdown bankruptcy liquidation restructurings and consolidation and the possible obligation to make payment to our partner our success is in many way dependent on the success of our partner from customer acquisition to cobranding arrangement from participation in our reward program to facilitating supplier payment for our corporate client we rely on our business partner across many aspect of our company and our arrangement with business partner represent significant portion of our business some of our partner manage certain aspect of our customer relationship such our optblue partner to the extent any of our partner fail to effectively promote and support our product experience slowdown in their business operational disruption reputational issue or loss of consumer confidence or are otherwise unable to meet our expectation or those of their other stakeholder our business may be materially negatively impacted we face the risk that existing relationship will be renegotiated with le favorable term for or that we may be unable to renegotiate on term that are acceptable to in addition we may be obligated to make or accelerate payment to certain business partner such of contentscobrand partner upon the occurrence of certain triggering event such shortfall in certain performance and revenue level if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering event we could unexpectedly have to make payment to these partner which could have negative effect on our financial condition and result of operation see note to our consolidated financial statement for additional information on financial commitment related to agreement with certain cobrand partner similarly we are exposed to risk from bankruptcy liquidation insolvency financial distress restructurings consolidation operational outage cyber security incident and other similar event that may occur in any industry representing significant portion of our network volume which could negatively impact particular card product and service and volume generally and our financial condition and result of operation we have previously and may in the future pre purchase loyalty point from certain of our cobrand partner the value of which may diminish to the extent such partner cease operation or such point become le desirable to our customer we could also be materially impacted if we were obligated or elected to reimburse card member for product and service purchased from merchant that have ceased operation or stopped accepting our card for example we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect card member against non delivery of purchase such where we have remitted payment to an airline for card member purchase of ticket that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member at december our best estimate of the maximum amount of billed business for purchase that had yet to be delivered by or could be charged back to merchant wa billion this amount assumes all such merchant worldwide cease operation and thus are no longer available to deliver such purchase or to accept such chargebacks and that all such billed business result in claim in full by card member such maximum amount ha not been indicative of our actual loss exposure in the past and we have not experienced significant loss related to these exposure to date however our historical experience may not be representative in the current environment given the current global economic financial and geopolitical condition see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding this exposure for additional information relating to the general risk related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline and travel industry under md we face continued intense competitive pressure that may materially impact the price we charge for accepting our card for payment well the risk of losing merchant relationship which could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation we face pressure from competitor that primarily rely on source of revenue other than discount revenue or have lower cost that can make their pricing for card acceptance more attractive merchant business partner and third party merchant acquirer and aggregator are also able to negotiate incentive pricing concession and other favorable contractual provision from condition to accepting our card being cobrand partner offering benefit to our card member or signing merchant on our behalf merchant become even larger such the largest tech company we may have to increase the amount of incentive and or concession we provide to them we also face the risk of losing merchant relationship that could materially adversely affect our network volume ability to retain current card member and attract new card member and therefore our business and result of operation our average merchant discount rate ha been impacted by regulatory change affecting competitor pricing in certain international country and may in the future be impacted by pricing regulation we have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate we increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volume at new merchant in addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment model and technology from non traditional player in the alternative payment space could pose challenge to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate some merchant including large tech company and other large merchant continue to invest in their own payment and financing solution such proprietary branded mobile wallet using both traditional and new technology platform if merchant are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and network and loan volume continuing priority of ours is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchant that if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial result we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rate or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rate for the reason discussed above and others which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added service for merchant business partner and card member surcharging or steering by merchant could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation in certain country such australia and certain member state in the eu and in certain state in the united state merchant are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchase and result of litigation settlement surcharging of credit card purchase is permitted by merchant in certain jurisdiction in canada in jurisdiction allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on american express card in certain merchant category and in some case either the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard card or visa and mastercard card are not surcharged at all practice that are known differential surcharging even though there are many card issued on competing network that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant of contentswe also encounter merchant that accept our card but tell their customer that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our card or certain of our card which could become more prevalent with the existence of debit card on the american express network our card member value the ability to use their card where and when they want to and we therefore take step to meet our card member expectation and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting discrimination through provision in our merchant contract including non discrimination and honor all card provision subject to local legal requirement we have increasingly relied on merchant acquirer aggregator and processor to manage certain aspect of our merchant relationship when we work with such third party we are dependent on them to promote and support the acceptance and usage of our card but they may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours new product such debit card on the american express network could fail to gain market acceptance and american express card could become le desirable to consumer and business generally due to surcharging steering or other form of discrimination which could result in decrease in card in force coverage and transaction volume the impact could vary depending on such factor the industry or manner in which surcharge is levied how card member are surcharged or steered to other card product or payment form at the point of sale the ease and speed of implementation for merchant merchant acquirer aggregator processor or other merchant service provider including result of new or emerging technology the size and recurrence of the underlying charge and whether and to what extent these action are applied to other form of payment including whether it varies depending on the type of card credit or debit product network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express card could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation particularly where it only or disproportionately impact credit card usage or card usage generally our card member or our business we may not be successful in our effort to promote card usage including through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member reward and service or to effectively control the cost of such investment both of which may materially impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our card growing loan balance and increasing fee revenue we have been investing in number of growth initiative including to attract new card member retain existing card member and capture greater share of customer total spending and borrowing there can be no assurance that our investment will continue to be effective particularly consumer and business behavior continue to change in addition if we develop new product or offer that attract customer looking for short term incentive rather than incentivize long term loyalty card member attrition and cost could increase increasing spending on our card also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our card if we are unable to continue growing merchant acceptance and perception of coverage or merchant decide to no longer accept american express card our business could suffer expanding our service offering adding customer acquisition channel and forming new partnership or renewing current partnership could have higher cost than our current arrangement fail to resonate with customer adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand another way we invest in customer value is through our membership reward program well other card member benefit any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemption of membership reward point and associated redemption cost could adversely affect our profitability we rely on third party for certain redemption option and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption option in the future which could diminish the value of the program for our card member our two largest redemption partner are amazon and delta in addition many credit card issuer have instituted reward and cobrand program and may introduce program and service that are similar to or more attractive than ours our inability to differentiate our product and service could materially adversely affect we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefit including containing the growth of marketing promotion reward and card member service expense in the future if such expense increase beyond our expectation we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing other area of revenue such fee based revenue decreasing operating expense or other investment in our business or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment in addition increased cost result of inflation colleague retention and recruitment supply chain issue and shortage of material such chip for our card may require that we reduce investment in other area our brand and reputation are key asset of our company and our business may be materially affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and it attribute are key asset and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and realize the benefit of the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card member and corporate client is highly dependent upon the external perception of our level of service trustworthiness business practice privacy and data protection management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition response to political and social issue or catastrophic event including our response to the covid pandemic and natural disaster and other subjective quality negative perception or publicity regarding these matter even if related to seemingly isolated incident and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card member corporate client merchant and partner which could make it difficult for to attract new customer and of contentsmaintain existing one negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activity or circumstance including card practice regulatory compliance the use and protection of customer information conduct by our colleague and policy engagement including activity of the american express company political action committee and from action taken by regulator or others in response thereto discussion about such matter in social medium channel can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by action taken by third party that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of or controversy related to third party service provider business partner merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by card member and merchant to thus damaging our reputation and brand value our brand may also be negatively impacted by acceptance of american express card by merchant in certain industry when american express card are used for payment for legal but controversial product and service or any government inquiry or legislative scrutiny related to card acceptance or usage the lack of acceptance suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchant can also negatively impact perception of our brand and our product lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment product or system adverse development with respect to our industry including the creation and implementation of new merchant category code may also negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against furthermore corporation with headquarters and operation located in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor development for area of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perception or publicity could materially and adversely affect our business volume revenue and profitability we publicly share certain information about our esg initiative we may face increased scrutiny related to these activity from government regulator the medium investor colleague customer and other stakeholder including from party that oppose esg initiative responding to esg consideration and the implementation of our esg goal and initiative involves risk and uncertainty requires investment and depends in part on third party performance or data that is outside of our control there can be no assurance that we will achieve our esg goal and initiative or that any such achievement will have the desired result our failure to achieve progress in these area on timely basis if at all could impact our reputation colleague retention and public perception of our business major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and material legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our product and service we and third party collect process transfer host store analyze retain provide access to and dispose of account information payment transaction information and certain type of personally identifiable and other information pertaining to our customer and colleague in connection with our card and other product and in the normal course of our business global financial institution like well our customer colleague regulator service provider and other third party have experienced significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent year and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer virus malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attack including phishing impersonation and identity takeover attempt corporate espionage hacking website defacement denial of service attack exploitation of vulnerability and other attack and similar disruption from the misconfiguration or unauthorized use of or access to computer system these threat can arise from external party well insider who knowingly or unknowingly engage in or enable malicious cyber activity there are number of motivation for cyber threat actor including criminal activity such fraud identity theft and ransom corporate or nation state espionage political agenda public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm intent to disrupt information technology system and supply chain and to expose and exploit potential security and privacy vulnerability in corporate system and website cyber threat including attack from state sponsored or nation state actor can increase during period of diplomatic or armed conflict such the ongoing conflict in ukraine our network and system are subject to constant attempt to disrupt our business operation and capture destroy manipulate or expose various type of information relating to corporate trade secret customer information including card member travel and loyalty program data colleague information and other sensitive business information including acquisition activity non public financial result and intellectual property for example we and other financial service provider have been the target of distributed denial of service attack from sophisticated third party we develop and maintain system and process aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incident and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating technology and regulatory requirement change new vulnerability and exploit are discovered and effort to overcome security measure become more sophisticated in addition we maintain cyber crisis response procedure and regularly test our procedure to remain prepared and reduce the risk of harm to our business operation customer and third party in the event of an information or cyber security incident despite our effort and the effort of third party that process transmit or store our data and data of our customer and colleague or support our operation such service provider merchant and regulator the possibility of information operational and cyber security incident malicious social engineering corporate espionage fraudulent or other malicious activity and human error or malfeasance can not be eliminated entirely and will evolve new and emerging technology is of contentsdeployed including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing device and communication platform that are outside of our network and control environment for example we are aware that certain of our third party vendor have been the victim of ransomware and other cyberattacks in some instance affecting our data or the service they provide to in addition new product and service such checking account and non card lending may lead to an increase in the number or type of cyber attack and our exposure to fraud and other malfeasance risk associated with such incident and activity include theft of fund and other monetary loss disruption of our operation and the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary trade secret or other information including account data information an incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for substantial period of time after it ha been discovered our ability to address incident may also depend on the timing and nature of assistance that may be provided from relevant governmental or law enforcement agency information operational or cyber security incident fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failure to maintain confidentiality integrity availability of service privacy and or security ha led to increased regulatory scrutiny and may lead to regulatory investigation and intervention such mandatory card reissuance consent decree increased litigation including class action litigation response cost including notification and remediation cost fine negative assessment of and our subsidiary by banking regulator and rating agency reputational and financial damage to our brand negative impact to our partner relationship and reduced usage of our product and service all of which could have material adverse impact on our business the disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resource successful cyberattacks data breach disruption or other incident related to the actual or perceived failure to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security at other large financial institution large retailer travel and hospitality company government agency or other market participant whether or not we are impacted could lead to general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measure or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our product and service such event could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirement although we maintain cyber insurance there can be no assurance that liability or loss we may incur will be covered under such policy or that the amount of insurance will be adequate the uninterrupted operation of our information system is critical to our success and significant disruption could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our information technology system and those of our third party upon which we rely including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement system and data center have experienced in limited instance and may continue to experience service disruption or degradation which may result from technology malfunction sudden increase in processing or other volume natural disaster and weather event fire accident technology change management issue power outage internet outage telecommunication failure fraud denial of service ransomware and other cyberattacks inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed market technology capacity management issue terrorism computer virus vulnerability in hardware or software physical or electronic break in or similar event service disruption or degradation can prevent access to our online service and account information compromise or limit access to company or customer data impede or prevent transaction processing and financial reporting disrupt ordinary business operation result in contractual penalty or obligation trigger regulatory reporting obligation and lead to regulatory investigation and fine increased regulatory oversight and litigation including class action litigation any such service disruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our product and service and materially adversely affect our overall business reputation and result of operation we rely on third party provider for acquiring and servicing customer technology platform and other service integral to the operation of our business these third party may act in way that could materially harm our business we rely on third party service provider cobrand partner merchant affiliate marketing firm processor aggregator network partner and other third party for service that are integral to our operation and are subject to the risk that activity of such third party may adversely affect our business outsourcing specialization of function third party digital service and technology innovation within the payment industry increase including with respect to mobile technology tokenization big data artificial intelligence and cloud based solution more third party are involved in processing card transaction handling our data and supporting our operation for example we rely on third party for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of service to our customer we have experienced in certain limited circumstance and may continue to experience disruption or other event at our third party or our third party service provider including their failure to fulfill their obligation and the information cyber security and operational incident described above such disruption could interrupt or compromise the quality of our service to customer impact the confidentiality integrity availability and security of our data lead to fraudulent transaction on our card or other product impact our business cause brand or reputational damage and lead to cost associated with responding to such disruption including notification and remediation cost cost to switch vendor or move operation in house regulatory investigation and fine and increased regulatory oversight and litigation third party could also cease providing data to or use our data in way that wa not authorized or diminishes the value of our closed loop of contentsthe management and oversight of multiple third party increase our operational complexity and governance challenge and decrease our control failure to exercise adequate oversight over third party including compliance with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirement could result in regulatory action fine litigation sanction or economic and reputational harm to in addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risk relating to our third party provider service provider we are also exposed to the risk that service disruption at service provider common to our third party could impede their ability to provide service to notwithstanding any attempt to diversify our reliance on third party in certain case there may be limited alternative or high cost for diversification and we also may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risk relating to the service provider of our third party provider if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological development and new product and service across all our business our revenue and profitability could be materially adversely affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in technology across all area of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence customer interaction and communication open banking and alternative payment and financing mechanism authentication technology and digital identification tokenization real time settlement and risk management and compliance system incorporating new technology into our product and service including developing the appropriate governance and control consistent with regulatory expectation requires substantial expenditure and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technology in the payment industry will continue to emerge and these new technology may be superior to or render obsolete our existing technology the process of developing new product and service enhancing existing product and service and adapting to technological change and evolving industry standard is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technological trend accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is key competitive factor and our competitor may develop product platform or technology that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the resource needed and our ability to develop new product and service particularly beyond our traditional card product and travel related service our use of artificial intelligence and machine learning is subject to risk related to flaw in our algorithm and datasets that may be insufficient or contain biased information these deficiency could undermine the decision prediction or analysis such technology produce subjecting to competitive harm legal liability and brand or reputational harm our ability to adopt new technology may be inhibited by the emergence of industry wide standard changing legislative and regulatory environment an inability to develop appropriate governance and control lack of internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card member or merchant lack of appropriate change management process or the complexity of our system in addition our adoption of new technology and our introduction of new product and service may expose to new or enhanced risk particularly in area where we have le experience or our existing governance and control system may be insufficient which could require to make substantial expenditure or subject to legal liability and brand or reputational harm we may not be successful in realizing the benefit associated with our acquisition strategic alliance joint venture and investment activity and our business and reputation could be materially adversely affected we have acquired number of business and have made number of strategic investment and continue to evaluate potential transaction there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify suitable candidate value potential investment or acquisition opportunity accurately negotiate acceptable term for those opportunity or complete proposed acquisition and investment the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure including in integrating system and personnel or further developing the acquired business or technology result in unanticipated liability including legal claim violation of law commercial dispute and information security vulnerability or breach including from not integrating the acquired company business or technology quickly or appropriately from activity that occurred prior to the acquisition and from exposure to third party relationship of the acquired company or business or new law and regulation and harm our business generally it may take longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefit of these transaction and those benefit may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could materially adversely affect our business and operating result including result of write down of goodwill and other intangible asset joint venture including our joint venture in china and minority investment in company such gbtg inherently involve lesser degree of control over business operation thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational and or compliance risk associated with the joint venture or minority investment including result of being subject to different law or regulation joint venture and other partnership or minority investment operating in foreign jurisdiction may also face risk from adverse regulatory action which could adversely affect their operation or our investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partner controlling shareholder or management who may have business interest strategy or goal that are inconsistent with ours and we have been and may in the future be involved in litigation with our joint venture partner and other shareholder and party related to the joint venture and investment during the second quarter of gbtg became publicly traded company following the completion of business combination between american express global business travel and apollo strategic growth capital we have extensive commercial arrangement with gbtg including among other thing long term trademark license agreement pursuant to which gbtg us the american express of contentsbrand gbtg support of our partnership gbtg negotiation with travel supplier on our behalf and strategic relationship between gbtg and our commercial service business business decision or other action or omission of joint venture partner other shareholder or management of our joint venture and company in which we have minority investment may adversely affect the value of our investment result in litigation or regulatory action against and otherwise damage our reputation and brand in addition trade secret and other proprietary information we may provide to joint venture may become available to third party beyond our control the ability to enforce intellectual property and contractual right to prevent disclosure of our trade secret and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdiction we may also face risk with other type of strategic transaction such the sale to incomm of the operation relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business the reloadable operation have experienced disruption in the past impacting the ability of our prepaid customer to load and use their card if such operation are interrupted suspended or terminated in the future it could further negatively impact our customer experience result in additional cost litigation and regulatory action and harm our business and reputation our success is dependent on maintaining culture of integrity and respect the resilience of our colleague through change in the working environment and upon our executive officer and other key personnel and misconduct by or loss of personnel could materially adversely affect our business we rely upon our personnel not only for business success but also to act with integrity and promote culture of respect to the extent our colleague behave in manner that doe not comport with our company value the consequence to our brand and reputation could be severe and could negatively affect our financial condition and result of operation our colleague have had to adapt to rapidly changing condition during the pandemic and the related return to office arrangement and if we are unable to continue addressing the safety health and productivity of our colleague well their expectation regarding workplace flexibility our business could suffer the changing nature of the office environment such return to office arrangement and the prevalence of remote and hybrid working may result in increased cost and present operational and workplace culture challenge that may also adversely affect our business the market for qualified individual with diverse perspective and reflecting the diversity of our community is highly competitive with elevated level of turnover in recent year and we may not be able to attract and retain such individual we have and may continue to experience increased cost related to compensation and other benefit necessary to attract and retain qualified personnel change in immigration and work permit law and regulation or the administration or enforcement of such law or regulation or other change in the legal or regulatory environment can also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel or to employ colleague in the location of our choice our compensation practice are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve and the compensation practice of aenb are subject to review and oversight by the occ this regulatory review and oversight could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officer and other key personnel our inability to attract and retain highly skilled motivated and diverse personnel could materially adversely affect our business and our culture our operation business customer and partner could be materially adversely affected by climate change there are increasing and rapidly evolving concern over the risk of climate change and related environmental sustainability matter the physical risk of climate change include rising average global temperature rising sea level and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather event and natural disaster such event and disaster could disrupt our operation or the operation of customer or third party on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customer spending behavior or ability to pay outstanding loan additionally we may face risk related to the transition to low carbon economy change in consumer preference travel pattern and legal requirement could increase expense or otherwise adversely impact our business our customer and partner we and other party in our value chain are expected to be subject to additional climate and other environmental related obligation arising from legislation and regulation in the united state and abroad for example banking regulator and other governmental authority and stakeholder are increasingly focused on the issue of climate risk at financial institution and several of the federal bank regulatory agency have issued proposal for principle designed to provide framework for the management of climate related risk disclosure of additional climate related information by company ha also begun to be mandated by legislation and regulator even the availability and quality of such information remains limited we could also be required to change our business and management practice and experience increased expense resulting from strategic planning litigation and change to our technology operation product and service well reputational harm result of negative public sentiment regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence due to our response to climate change and our effort relating to the advancing climate solution pillar of our esg strategy our risk management framework may not be effective in identifying measuring and controlling our exposure to climate related risk particularly given that the timing nature and severity of the impact of climate change may not be predictable legal regulatory and compliance risksour business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could materially adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we are subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdiction around the world which significantly affect our business and requires continual enhancement of our compliance effort supervision effort and the enforcement of existing law and regulation impact the scope and profitability of our existing business activity limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunity and adopt new technology compromise our competitive position and affect our relationship of contentswith card member partner merchant service provider and other third party new law or regulation could similarly affect our business increase our cost of doing business impact what we are able to charge for or offer in connection with our product and service impose conflicting obligation and require to change certain of our business practice and invest significant management attention and resource all of which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition legislator and regulator around the world are aware of each other approach to the regulation of the financial service industry consequently development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another in preparation for the completion of brexit numerous eu law and regulation were separately adopted into uk domestic legislation in order to ensure continuity however the uk plan to evaluate the extent to which these eu legacy law and regulation should change going forward and ha already indicated some area where it may take different approach from the eu to the extent that different regulatory system impose overlapping or inconsistent requirement on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional cost in our compliance effort well potential regulatory enforcement action and penalty if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirement or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital action such declaring dividend or repurchasing outstanding share or engage in certain business activity or acquisition which could compromise our competitive position additionally our banking regulator have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statute and regulation and may restrict our ability to engage in certain business activity or acquisition or require to maintain more capital legislator and regulator continue to focus on the operation of card network including interchange fee paid to card issuer in payment network such visa and mastercard network routing practice and the fee merchant are charged to accept card even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fee significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decrease in competitor pricing in connection with cap on interchange fee in some case regulation also extend or may extend to certain aspect of our business such network and cobrand arrangement new product or service we may offer or the term of card acceptance for merchant including term relating to non discrimination and honor all card for example we have exited our network business in the eu and australia result of regulation in those jurisdiction in addition there is uncertainty to when or how interchange fee cap and other provision of payment legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partner and agent in the eu in ruling issued on february the eu court of justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee cap and other provision in circumstance where three party network issue card with cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance to when or how the provision might apply in such circumstance and remains subject to differing interpretation by regulator and participant in cobrand arrangement result we are subject to regulatory action penalty and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationship in the eu we are subject to certain provision of the bank secrecy act amended by the patriot act and the amla with regard to maintaining effective aml cft program similar aml cft requirement apply under the law of most jurisdiction where we operate regulator increase their focus in this area new technology such digital currency develop and we introduce new product like checking account we face increased cost related to oversight supervision and potential fine our aml cft program have become the subject of heightened scrutiny in some country including certain member state in the eu any error failure or delay in complying with aml cft law perceived deficiency in our aml cft program or association of our business with money laundering terrorist financing tax fraud or other illicit activity can give rise to significant supervisory criminal and civil proceeding and lawsuit which could result in significant penalty and forfeiture of asset loss of license or restriction on business activity or other enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customer association with certain country person or entity or the existence of any such transaction various regulatory agency and legislature are also considering regulation and legislation covering identity theft account management guideline credit bureau reporting disclosure rule security and marketing that would impact directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standard any new requirement may restrict our ability to issue card or partner with other financial institution which could adversely affect our revenue growth see supervision and regulation for more information about certain law and regulation to which we are subject and their impact on litigation and regulatory action could subject to significant fine penalty judgment and or requirement resulting in significantly increased expense damage to our reputation and or material adverse effect on our business at any given time we are involved in number of legal proceeding including class action lawsuit many of these action have included claim for substantial compensatory or punitive damage while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreement with customer to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future including result of possible regulation that would require that our consumer arbitration clause not apply to case filed in court class action and claim of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexity risk and cost associated with class action case the continued focus of merchant on issue relating to the acceptance of various form of payment may lead to additional litigation and other of contentslegal action given the inherent uncertainty involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damage sought in some matter asserted against there is significant uncertainty to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation we are also involved at any given time with governmental and regulatory inquiry investigation and proceeding regulatory action could subject to significant fine penalty or other requirement resulting in card member reimbursement increased expense limitation or condition on our business activity and damage to our reputation and our brand all of which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we expect that financial institution such will continue to face significant regulatory scrutiny with regulator taking formal enforcement action against financial institution in addition to addressing supervisory concern through non public supervisory action or finding which could involve restriction on our activity among other limitation that could adversely affect our business in addition violation of law or regulation by another financial institution could give rise to an investigation by regulator and other governmental agency of the same or similar practice by further single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigation and proceeding external publicity concerning investigation can increase the scope and scale of investigation and lead to further regulatory inquiry for example previously disclosed in may we began responding to review by the occ and the department of justice doj civil division regarding historical sale practice relating to sale to small business customer in the united state in january we received grand jury subpoena from the united state attorney office for the eastern district of new york edny regarding these sale practice issue well civil investigative demand from the cfpb pertaining to it investigation into sale practice related to consumer in january the cfpb notified that it investigation wa completed and that it doe not intend to recommend an enforcement action be taken against at this time the occ doj and edny review and investigation are ongoing and could result in enforcement action or other regulatory proceeding against seeking fine or other remedial action we are cooperating with all inquiry we continue to review and enhance our process and control related to our sale practice and business conduct generally take disciplinary and remedial action where appropriate and provide information regarding our review to our regulator including the federal reserve we also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny result of the effect of the pandemic on market and economic condition such renewed focus on fair lending law and action governmental authority take in response to those condition and in connection with our esg related disclosure and initiative legal proceeding regarding provision in our merchant contract including non discrimination and honor all card provision could have material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and or arbitration change to our merchant agreement and or business practice substantial monetary damage and damage to our reputation and brand we are and have been in the past defendant in number of action including legal proceeding and proposed class action challenging certain provision of our card acceptance agreement see note to the consolidated financial statement for description of certain outstanding legal proceeding an adverse outcome in these proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation require to change our merchant agreement in way that could expose our card to increased merchant steering and other form of discrimination that could impair the card member experience result in additional litigation and or arbitration impose substantial monetary damage and damage our reputation and brand even if we were not required to change our merchant agreement change in visa and mastercard policy or practice result of legal proceeding lawsuit settlement or regulatory action pending against them could result in change to our business practice and materially and adversely impact our profitability we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rule and if we fail to meet these rule our business would be materially adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirement could compromise our competitive position and could result in restriction imposed by the federal reserve or the occ with respect to aenb including limiting our ability to pay dividend repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisition some element of the capital and liquidity regime are not yet final and certain development could significantly impact the requirement applicable to financial institution for example if the basel committee revision to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirement are adopted in the united state and applicable to we are likely to be required to hold significantly more capital in addition it may be necessary for to hold additional capital because of an increase in the scb requirement based on result from supervisory stress test compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rule requires material investment of resource an inability to meet regulatory expectation regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rule may also negatively impact the assessment of and our bank subsidiary by federal banking regulator for more information on capital adequacy requirement see capital and liquidity regulation under supervision and regulation we are subject to restriction that limit our ability to pay dividend and repurchase our capital stock our subsidiary are also subject to restriction that limit their ability to pay dividend to which may adversely affect our liquidity of contentswe are limited in our ability to pay dividend and repurchase capital stock by our regulator who have broad authority to prohibit any action that would be considered an unsafe or unsound banking practice we are subject to requirement to submit capital plan to the federal reserve for review that include among other thing projected dividend payment and repurchase of capital stock part of the capital planning and stress testing process our proposed capital action are assessed against our ability to satisfy applicable capital requirement in the event of stressed market environment if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirement including the stress capital buffer our ability to undertake capital action may be restricted our ability to declare or pay dividend on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire share of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exception in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividend for the last preceding dividend period of our preferred stock american express company relies on dividend from it subsidiary for liquidity and such dividend may be limited by law regulation or supervisory policy for example our bank subsidiary aenb is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitation on it declaration and payment of dividend these limitation may hinder our ability to access fund we may need to make payment on our obligation make dividend payment on outstanding american express company capital stock or otherwise achieve strategic objective any future reduction or elimination of our common stock dividend or share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and market perception of american express for more information on bank holding company and depository institution dividend restriction see stress testing and capital planning and dividend and other capital distribution under supervision and regulation well consolidated capital resource and liquidity dividend and share repurchase under md and note to our consolidated financial statement regulation in the area of privacy data protection data governance resiliency data transfer third party oversight account access and information and cyber security could increase our cost and affect or limit our business opportunity and how we collect and or use personal information legislator and regulator in the united state and other country in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy data protection data governance resiliency data transfer third party oversight account access and information and cyber security law including data localization authentication and notification law such law are interpreted and applied in some case with significant difference or conflicting requirement across jurisdiction compliance and technology cost will continue to increase particularly in the context of ensuring that adequate data governance data protection incident management resiliency third party management data transfer security control and account access mechanism are in place compliance with current or future privacy data protection data governance resiliency data transfer third party oversight account access and information and cyber security law could significantly impact our collection use sharing retention and safeguarding of consumer and or colleague information and could restrict our ability to fully maximize our closed loop capability or provide certain product and service or work with certain service provider which could materially and adversely affect our profitability our failure to comply with such law could result in potentially significant regulatory and or governmental investigation and or action litigation fine sanction ongoing regulatory monitoring customer attrition decrease in the use or acceptance of our card and damage to our reputation and our brand in recent year there ha been increasing regulatory enforcement and litigation activity in the area of privacy data protection and information and cyber security in the united state the eu and various other country in which we operate for more information on regulatory and legislative activity in this area see privacy data protection data governance information and cyber security under supervision and regulation we may not be able to effectively manage the operational and compliance risk to which we are exposed we consider operational risk to be the risk of loss due to among other thing inadequate or failed process people or information system or impact from the external environment natural disaster operational risk includes among others the risk that error or misconduct could result in material financial misstatement failure to monitor third party compliance with regulatory or legal requirement or failure to adequately monitor and control access to or use of data in our system we grant to third party process or organization are changed or new product and service are introduced such new lending feature debit product and checking account we may not fully appreciate or identify new operational risk that may arise from such change through human error fraud or malfeasance conduct risk can result in harm to customer legal liability fine sanction customer remediation and brand damage compliance risk arises from violation of or failure to conform or comply with law rule regulation internal policy and procedure and ethical standard we need to continually update and enhance our control environment to address operational and compliance risk operational and compliance failure deficiency in our control environment or an inability to maintain an ethical workplace and high standard of business conduct can expose to reputational and legal risk well fine civil money penalty or payment of damage and can lead to diminished business opportunity and diminished ability to expand key operation if we are not able to protect our intellectual property or successfully defend against any infringement or misappropriation assertion brought against our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected we rely on variety of measure to protect our intellectual property and control access to and distribution of our trade secret and other proprietary information these measure may not prevent infringement of our intellectual property right or of contentsmisappropriation of our proprietary information and resulting loss of competitive advantage the ability to enforce intellectual property right to prevent disclosure of our trade secret and other proprietary information may be limited in certain jurisdiction in addition competitor or other third party may allege that our product system process or technology infringe on their intellectual property right given the complex rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate and the potential risk and uncertainty of intellectual property related litigation future assertion of an infringement or misappropriation claim against could cause to lose significant revenue incur significant defense license royalty or technology development expense and or pay significant monetary damage tax legislative initiative or assessment could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we are subject to income and other tax in the united state and in various foreign jurisdiction the law and regulation related to tax matter are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretation although management belief our position are reasonable we are subject to audit by the internal revenue service in the united state and by tax authority in all the jurisdiction in which we conduct business operation we are being challenged in number of country regarding our application of value added tax vat to certain transaction while we believe we comply with all applicable vat and other tax law rule and regulation in the relevant jurisdiction the tax authority may determine that we owe additional tax or apply existing law and regulation more broadly which could result in significant increase in liability for tax and interest in excess of accrued liability new tax legislation could be enacted in the country in which we have operation for example new guideline issued by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd would impact how multinational enterprise mnes are taxed on their global profit in particular the oecd guideline on global minimum tax of percent could impact the effective tax rate for many mnes number of country including the member state in the eu have adopted or plan to adopt these minimum tax guideline starting in which we expect would impact our effective tax rate when the rule become effective in addition to legislative change action by tax authority including an increase in tax audit activity could have an adverse impact on our tax liability credit liquidity and market risksour risk management policy and procedure may not be effective our risk management framework seek to identify and mitigate risk and appropriately balance risk and return although we have devoted significant resource to develop our risk management policy and procedure and expect to continue to do so in the future these policy and procedure well our risk management technique such our hedging strategy may not be fully effective there may also be risk that exist or develop in the future that we have not appropriately identified or mitigated regulation technology and competition continue to evolve our risk management framework may not always keep sufficient pace with those change if our risk management framework doe not effectively identify or mitigate our risk we could suffer unexpected loss and could be materially adversely affected management of our risk in some case depends upon the use of analytical and or forecasting model although we have governance framework for model development and independent model validation the modeling methodology or key assumption could be erroneous or the model could be misused in addition issue with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedure well the quality and integrity of data input could result in ineffective or inaccurate model output and report for example model based on historical data set might not be accurate predictor of future outcome and they may not be able to predict future outcome our model also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent the cecl methodology requires measurement of expected credit loss for the estimated life of certain financial instrument not only based on historical experience and current condition but also by including forecast incorporating forward looking information if our business decision or estimate for credit loss are based on incorrect or misused model and assumption or we fail to manage data input effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner our result of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected we are exposed to credit risk and trend that affect card member spending and the ability of customer and partner to pay which could have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to both individual credit risk principally from consumer and small business card member loan and receivables and institutional credit risk principally from corporate card member loan and receivables merchant network partner loyalty coalition partner and treasury and investment counterparties third party may default on their obligation to due to bankruptcy lack of liquidity operational failure or other reason general economic factor such gross domestic product unemployment inflation and interest rate may result in greater delinquency that lead to greater credit loss customer ability and willingness to repay can be negatively impacted not only by economic market political and social condition but also by customer other payment obligation and increasing leverage can result in higher risk that customer will default or become delinquent in their obligation to we rely principally on the customer creditworthiness for repayment of loan or receivables and therefore often have no other recourse for collection our ability to ass creditworthiness may be impaired result of change in our underwriting practice or if the criterion or model we use to manage our credit risk prove inaccurate in predicting future loss which could have negative impact on our result of operation this may be exacerbated to the extent information we have historically relied upon to make credit decision doe not accurately portray customer creditworthiness including result of the of contentscurrent high rate of inflation and economic slowdown further our pricing strategy particularly for new lending feature and non card lending product may not offset the negative impact on profitability caused by increase in delinquency and loss thus any material increase in delinquency and loss beyond our current estimate could have material adverse impact on although we make estimate to provide for credit loss in our outstanding portfolio of loan and receivables these estimate may not be accurate in addition the information we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete we have experienced higher delinquency and write off rate for the year ended december compared to the year ended december and such rate are expected to continue to increase rising delinquency and rising rate of bankruptcy are often precursor of future write offs and may require to increase our reserve for credit loss higher write off rate and the resulting increase in our reserve for credit loss adversely affect our profitability and the performance of our securitizations and may increase our cost of fund although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific client and counterparties and to specific industry country and region that we believe may present credit concern default risk may arise from event or circumstance that are difficult to foresee or detect such fraud in addition our ability to manage credit risk or collect amount owed to may be adversely affected by legal or regulatory change such restriction on collection or change in bankruptcy law minimum payment regulation and age guidance increased credit risk

may incur an unattractive cost to raise capital which could decrease profitability and significantly reduce financial flexibility additional factor affecting the extent to which we may securitize loan and receivables in the future include the overall credit quality of our loan and receivables the cost of securitizing our loan and receivables the demand for credit card asset backed security and the legal regulatory accounting or tax rule affecting securitization transaction and asset backed security generally our liquidity and cost of fund would also be adversely affected by the occurrence of

limit our access to the capital market and adversely affect the cost and other term upon which we are able to obtain funding our ability to raise funding through the securitization market also depends in part on the credit rating of the security we issue from our securitization trust if we are not able to satisfy rating agency requirement to confirm the rating of our asset backed security it could limit our ability to access the securitization market adverse currency fluctuation and foreign exchange control could decrease earnings we receive from our international operation and impact our

variety of interest rate scenario to inform of the potential impact from interest rate change on earnings and the value of asset liability and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time result of among other thing the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposit compared to our card member loan and receivables interest rate swap are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuance to variable rate from fixed rate or vice versa refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our derivative financial instrument of december hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rate would have detrimental impact of approximately million on our annual net interest income this measure first project net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rate the detrimental impact from rate change is measured by instantaneously increasing or decreasing the anticipated future interest rate by basis point our estimated repricing risk assumes that our interest rate sensitive asset and liability that reprice within the twelve month horizon generally reprice by the same magnitude subject to applicable interest rate cap or floor benchmark rate change it is further assumed that within our interest rate sensitive liability certain deposit reprice at lower magnitude than benchmark rate movement and the magnitude of this repricing in turn depends on among other factor the direction of rate movement these assumption are consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual change in our net interest income will depend on many factor and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to change in market interest rate foreign exchange riskforeign exchange exposure arise in four principal way card member spending in currency that are not the billing currency cross currency transaction and balance from our funding activity cross currency investing activity such in the equity of foreign subsidiary and revenue generated and expense incurred in foreign currency which impact earnings these foreign exchange risk are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transaction or hedged with foreign exchange forward contract when the hedge cost are economically justified and in notional amount designed to offset pretax impact from currency movement in the period in which they occur of december foreign currency derivative instrument with total notional amount of approximately billion were outstanding of contentswith respect to card member spending and cross currency transaction including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding the impact of hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would have been immaterial to projected earnings of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balance including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity of december with respect to anticipated earnings denominated in foreign currency for the next twelve month the adverse impact on pretax income of hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would be approximately million of december to much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activity conducted by our foreign exchange international payment business we aim to minimize market risk from these activity through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limit the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate change will depend on among other factor the timing of rate change the extent to which different rate do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree change in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activity and change in the volume and mix of our business funding liquidity risk management processwe define funding and liquidity risk our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligation at reasonable cost they become due our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guide and governs liquidity risk management funding and liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee to manage this risk we seek to maintain access to diverse set of cash readily marketable security and contingent source of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirement and expected future financing obligation for at least twelve month period in the event we are unable to raise new fund under our regular funding program during substantial weakening in economic condition we consider the trade offs between maintaining too much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during liquidity event funding and liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level well at certain subsidiary in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resource are maintained the funding and liquidity committee review forecast of our aggregate and subsidiary cash position and financing requirement approves funding plan designed to satisfy those requirement under normal and stressed condition establishes guideline to identify the amount of liquidity resource required and monitor position and determines any action to be taken model risk management processwe define model risk the risk of adverse consequence such financial loss poor business and strategic decision making

the meaningfulness and measurability of the risk furthermore esg risk with an emphasis on climate related risk are currently identified an emerging risk within our risk governance framework of contentscritical accounting estimatesrefer to note to the consolidated financial statement for summary of our significant accounting policy certain of our accounting policy requiring significant management assumption and judgment are follows reserve for card member credit lossesreserves for card member credit loss represent our best estimate of the expected credit loss in our outstanding portfolio of card member loan and receivables of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology which became effective january requires to estimate lifetime expected credit loss by incorporating historical loss experience well current and future economic condition over reasonable and supportable period period beyond the balance sheet date in estimating expected credit loss we use combination of statistically based model and analysis of the result produced by these model to determine the quantitative and qualitative component of our total balance sheet reserve for credit loss these quantitative and qualitative component entail significant amount of judgment the primary area of judgment used in measuring the quantitative component of our reserve relate to the determination of the appropriate period the modeling of the probability of and exposure at default and the methodology to incorporate current and future economic condition we use these model and assumption combined with historical loss experience to determine the reserve rate that are applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce our reserve for expected credit loss for the period the qualitative component is intended to capture expected loss that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure we consider certain external and internal factor including emerging portfolio characteristic and trend which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserve for card member credit loss the period which is approximately three year represents the maximum time period beyond the balance sheet date over which we can reasonably estimate expected credit loss using all available portfolio information current economic condition and forecast of future economic condition card member loan product do not have contractual term and balance can revolve if minimum required payment are made causing some balance to remain outstanding beyond the period to determine expected credit loss beyond the period we immediately revert to long term average loss rate card member receivable product are contractually required to be paid in full therefore we have assumed the balance will be either paid or written off no later than day past due within the period our model use past loss experience and current and future economic condition to estimate the probability of default exposure at default and expected recovery to estimate net loss at default significant area of judgment relates to how we apply future card member payment to the reporting period balance when determining the exposure at default the nature of revolving loan product inherently includes relationship between future payment and spend behavior which creates complexity in the application of how future payment are either partially or entirely attributable to the existing balance at the end of the reporting period using historical customer behavior and other factor we have assumed that future payment are first allocated to interest and fee associated with the reporting period balance and future spend we then allocate portion of the payment to the estimated higher minimum payment amount due because of any future spend any remaining portion of the future payment is then allocated to the remaining reporting period balance cecl requires that the period include an assumption about current and future economic condition we incorporate multiple macroeconomic scenario provided to by an independent third party the estimated credit loss calculated from each macroeconomic scenario are reviewed each period and weighted to reflect management judgment about uncertainty surrounding these scenario these macroeconomic scenario contain certain variable including unemployment rate and real gdp that are significant to our model of contentsmacroeconomic sensitivityto demonstrate the sensitivity of estimated credit loss to the macroeconomic scenario we compared our modeled estimate under baseline scenario to that under pessimistic downside scenario of december for every percentage point change in weighting from the baseline scenario to the pessimistic downside scenario the estimated credit loss increased by approximately million the modeled estimate under these scenario were influenced by the duration severity and timing of change in economic variable within each scenario and these macroeconomic scenario under different condition or using different assumption could result in significantly different estimated credit loss it is difficult to estimate how potential change in specific factor might affect the estimated credit loss and current result may not be indicative of the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast change in addition this sensitivity analysis relates only to the modeled credit loss estimate under two scenario without considering management judgment on the relative weighting for those and other scenario including the weight that ha been placed on the downside scenario at the balance sheet date or any potential change in other adjustment to the quantitative reserve component or the impact of management judgment for the qualitative reserve component which may have positive or negative effect on the result thus the result of this sensitivity analysis are hypothetical and are not intended to estimate or reflect our expectation of any change in the overall reserve for credit loss due to change in the macroeconomic environment refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further information on the range of macroeconomic scenario key variable used in conjunction with other input described above to calculate reserve for card member credit loss the process of estimating these reserve requires high degree of judgment to the extent our expected credit loss model are not indicative of future performance actual loss could differ significantly from our judgment and expectation resulting in either higher or lower future provision for credit loss in any period of contentsliability for membership rewardsthe membership reward program is our largest card based reward program card member can earn point for purchase charged on their enrolled card product significant portion of our card by their term allow card member to earn bonus point for purchase at merchant in particular industry category membership reward point are redeemable for broad variety of reward including but not limited to travel shopping gift card and covering eligible charge point typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of point card member may earn membership reward expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled card customer participation in the program and contractual arrangement with redemption partner we record membership reward liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of point earned that are expected to be redeemed by card member in the future the membership reward liability is impacted over time by enrollment level attrition the volume of point earned and redeemed and the associated redemption cost we estimate the membership reward liability by determining the urr and the weighted average cost wac per point which are applied to the point of current enrollee refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of point earned by current enrollee that will ultimately be redeemed in future period we use statistical and actuarial model to estimate the urr of point earned to date by current card member based on redemption trend card product type enrollment tenure card spend level and credit attribute the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption cost and is primarily based on redemption choice made by card member reward offering by partner and membership reward program change the wac per point assumption is derived from month of redemption and is adjusted appropriate for certain change in redemption cost that are not representative of future cost expectation and expected development in redemption pattern we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumption based on development in redemption pattern cost per point redeemed partner contract change and other factor the process of estimating the membership reward liability includes high degree of judgment actual redemption and associated redemption cost could differ significantly from our estimate resulting in either higher or lower membership reward expense change in the membership reward urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership reward expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all point previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollee of the end of the reporting period of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollee of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million goodwill recoverabilitygoodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when event or circumstance arise such adverse change in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below it carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factor in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount the qualitative factor may include but are not limited to economic condition industry and market consideration cost factor overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit specific event if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment of contentsour methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting unit which inherently entail the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use combination of the income approach discounted cash flow and market approach market multiple in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit when preparing discounted cash flow model under the income approach we estimate future cash flow using the reporting unit internal multi year forecast and terminal value calculated using growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic condition to discount these cash flow we use our expected cost of equity determined using capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded company multiple earnings revenue to our reporting unit operating result the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flow discount rate and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting unit we could be exposed to an increased risk of goodwill impairment if future operating result or macroeconomic condition differ significantly from management current assumption income taxeswe are subject to the income tax law of the united state it state and municipality and those of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing provision for income tax expense we must make judgment about the application of inherently complex tax law unrecognized tax benefitswe establish liability for unrecognized tax benefit which are the difference between tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statement in establishing liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumption may be made in determining whether and the extent to which tax position should be sustained tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on it technical merit the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement new information becomes available we evaluate our tax position and adjust our unrecognized tax benefit appropriate tax benefit ultimately realized can differ from amount previously recognized due to uncertainty with any such difference generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realizationdeferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse since deferred tax measure the future tax effect of item recognized in the consolidated financial statement certain estimate and assumption are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary difference and available tax planning strategy these assessment are performed quarterly taking into account any new information change in fact or circumstance can lead to change in the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset due to uncertainty of contentsother mattersas previously disclosed we identified during an internal review that over time certain current and former card member with

and receivables of the balance sheet date the cecl methodology requires to estimate lifetime expected credit loss by incorporating historical loss experience well current and future economic condition over reasonable and supportable period period which is approximately three year beyond the balance sheet date we make various judgment combined with historical loss experience to determine reserve rate that is applied to the outstanding loan or receivable balance to produce reserve for expected credit loss we use combination of statistically based model that incorporate current and future economic condition throughout the period the process of estimating expected credit loss is based on several key model probability of default pd exposure at default ead and future recovery for each month of the period beyond the period we estimate expected credit loss by immediately reverting to long term average loss rate pd model are used to estimate the likelihood an account will be written off ead model are used to estimate the balance of an account at the time of write off this includes balance le expected repayment based on historical payment and revolve behavior which vary by customer due to the nature of revolving loan portfolio the ead model are complex and involve assumption regarding the relationship between future spend and payment behavior recovery model are used to estimate amount that are expected to be received from card member after default occurs typically result of collection effort future recovery are estimated taking into consideration the time of default time elapsed since default and macroeconomic condition we also estimate the likelihood and magnitude of recovery of previously written off account considering how long ago the account wa written off and future economic condition even if such expected recovery exceed expected loss our model are developed using historical loss experience covering the economic cycle and consider the impact of account characteristic on expected loss future economic condition that are incorporated over the period include multiple macroeconomic scenario provided to by an independent third party management review these economic scenario each period and applies judgment to weight them in order to reflect the uncertainty surrounding these scenario these macroeconomic scenario contain certain variable including unemployment rate and real gross domestic product gdp that are significant to our model we also evaluate whether to include qualitative reserve to cover loss that are expected but in our assessment may not be adequately represented in the quantitative method or the economic assumption we consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve higher or lower to address possible limitation within the model or factor not included within the model such external condition emerging portfolio trend the nature and size of the portfolio portfolio concentration the volume and severity of past due account or management risk action lifetime loss for most of our loan and receivables are evaluated at an appropriate level of granularity including assessment on pooled basis where financial asset share similar risk characteristic such past spend and remittance behavior credit bureau score where available delinquency status tenure of balance outstanding amongst others credit loss on accrued interest are measured and presented part of reserve for credit loss on the consolidated balance sheet and within the provision for credit loss in the consolidated statement of income rather than reversing interest income separate model are used for account deemed troubled debt restructuring which are measured individually and incorporate discounted cash flow model see note for information on troubled debt restructurings loan and receivable balance are written off when we consider amount to be uncollectible which is generally determined by the number of day past due and is typically no

some matter have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and or development of important factual information and legal issue to enable to estimate an amount of loss or range of possible loss while other matter have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceeding an accrual is recorded when it is both probable that loss ha occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instance in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on quarterly basis development in legal proceeding that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that ha been previously recorded or revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible loss applicable for those disclosed legal proceeding where loss is reasonably possible in future period whether in excess of recorded accrual for legal or tax contingency or where there is no

these instrument derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variable including interest rate and foreign exchange rate and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet these instrument enable end user to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risk and for that reason are an integral component of our market risk management we do not transact in derivative for trading purpose market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability value resulting from movement in market price our market risk exposure include interest rate risk due to change in the relationship between the interest rate on our asset such loan receivables and investment security and the interest rate on our liability such debt and deposit and foreign exchange risk related to transaction funding investment and earnings in currency other than the dollar we centrally monitor market risk using market risk limit and escalation trigger defined in our asset liability management policy our market exposure are in large part by product of the delivery of our product and service interest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of card member receivables and fixed rate loan with variable rate borrowing well through the risk to net interest margin from change in the relationship between benchmark rate such prime the secured overnight financing rate and the overnight indexed swap rate interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed rate lending product is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short term and variable rate debt and deposit compared to fixed rate debt and deposit in addition interest rate swap are used from time to time to economically convert fixed rate debt obligation to variable rate obligation or to convert variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate obligation we may change the mix between variable rate and fixed rate funding based on change in business volume and mix among other factor foreign exchange exposure arise in four principal way card member spending in currency that are not the billing currency cross currency transaction and balance from our funding activity cross currency investing activity such in the equity of foreign subsidiary and revenue generated and expense incurred in foreign currency which impact earnings our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreement to buy and sell currency on spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economical through various mean including the use of derivative such foreign exchange forward derivative may give rise to counterparty credit risk which is the risk that derivative counterparty will default on or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to an uncollateralized derivative exposure we manage this risk by considering the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contract on the measurement date well estimating the maximum potential future exposure of the contract over the next month considering such factor the volatility of the underlying or reference index to mitigate derivative credit risk counterparties are required to be pre approved by and rated investment grade and counterparty risk exposure are centrally monitored majority of our derivative asset and liability of december and are subject to master netting agreement with our derivative counterparties accordingly where appropriate we have elected to present derivative asset and liability with the same counterparty on net basis in the consolidated balance sheet to further mitigate counterparty credit risk we exercise our right under executed credit support agreement with the respective derivative counterparties for our bilateral interest rate swap and select foreign exchange contract these agreement require that in the event the fair value change in the net derivative position between the two party exceeds certain dollar threshold the party in the net liability position post collateral to it counterparty all derivative contract cleared through central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contract in relation to our credit risk certain of our bilateral derivative agreement include provision that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position of december these derivative were not in material net liability position and we had no material risk exposure to any individual derivative counterparty based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties and our own credit risk of december and no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio wa required of contentsour derivative are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet the accounting for change in fair value depends on the instrument intended use and the resulting hedge designation if any

derivative balance derivative financial instrument that qualify for hedge accountingderivatives executed for hedge accounting purpose are documented and designated such when we enter into the contract in accordance with our risk management policy we structure our hedge with term similar to those of the item being hedged we formally ass at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on quarterly basis whether derivative designated hedge are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flow of the hedged item these assessment usually are made through the application of regression analysis method if it is determined that derivative is not highly effective hedge we will discontinue the application of hedge accounting fair value hedgesa fair value hedge involves derivative designated to hedge our exposure to future change in the fair value of an asset or liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to particular risk interest rate contractswe are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate debt obligation at the time of issuance certain fixed rate long term debt obligation are designated in fair value hedging relationship using interest rate swap to economically convert the fixed interest rate to floating interest rate we had billion and billion of fixed rate debt obligation designated in fair value hedging relationship of december and respectively gain or loss on the fair value hedging instrument principally offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the hedged item may not fully offset due to difference between debt obligation interest rate and the benchmark rate primarily due to credit spread at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap of contentsthe following table present the gain and loss recognized in interest expense on the
