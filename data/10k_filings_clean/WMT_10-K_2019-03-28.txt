discussing our operating result the term currency exchange rate refers to the currency exchange rate we use to convert the operating result for country where the functional currency is not the dollar

generally report comparable sale using the retail calendar also known the calendar to be consistent with the retail industry we provide comparable sale using the retail calendar in our quarterly

comparable sale using the retail calendar calendar comparable sale well the impact of fuel for fiscal and were follows fiscal year ended january with fuel fuel impactwalmart sam club total walmart comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively driven by ticket and traffic growth walmart ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and fiscal respectively we continue to focus on seamless omni channel experience for our customer sam club comparable sale increased and in fiscal and respectively sam club fiscal comparable sale were driven by strong traffic which wa aided by transfer of sale from our closed club to our existing club and fuel sale these increase were partially offset by reduced tobacco sale due to our decision to remove tobacco from certain location in fiscal sam club fiscal comp sale were driven by strong traffic and fuel sale sam club ecommerce sale positively contributed approximately and to comparable sale for fiscal and respectively operating disciplinewe operate with discipline by managing expense optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in which we have sustainable lowest cost to serve we invest in technology and process improvement to increase productivity manage inventory and reduce cost we measure operating discipline through expense leverage which we define net sale growing at faster rate than operating selling general and administrative expense fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative expense change from comparable period operating selling general and administrative expense percentage of net sale for fiscal operating selling general and administrative operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the primary driver of the expense leverage were strong sale performance in conjunction with productivity improvement and lapping fiscal charge discussed in the following paragraph the improvement in fiscal were partially offset by additional investment in ecommerce and technology well million charge related to security class action lawsuit for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale increased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year while our increase in net sale and improving expense management had positive impact on our operating expense percentage of net sale we not leverage expense result of approximately billion in charge related to sam club closure and discontinued real estate project million related to lump sum bonus paid to associate million related to home office severance the legal accrual of million related to the fcpa matter charge of million related to discontinued real estate project in walmart and the decision to exit certain international property and wind the first party brazil ecommerce operation strategic capital allocationwe are allocating more capital to ecommerce technology supply chain and store remodels and le to new store and club opening when compared to prior year this allocation aligns with our initiative of improving our customer proposition in store and club and seamless omni channel experience for our customer total fiscal capital expenditure increased slightly compared to the prior year the following table provides additional detail amount in million fiscal year ended january allocation of capital expenditure technology supply chain and other store and club including expansion and relocation international capital expenditure we execute our financial framework we believe our return on capital will improve over time we measure return on capital with our return on asset return on investment and free cash flow metric we also provide return in the form of share repurchase and dividend which are discussed in the liquidity and capital resource section return on asset and return on investment we include return on asset roa the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statement presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle in the gaap and return on investment roi metric to ass return on asset while roi is considered non gaap financial measure management belief roi is meaningful metric to share with investor because it help investor ass how effectively walmart is deploying it asset trend in roi can fluctuate over time management balance long term strategic initiative with possible short term impact roa wa and for the fiscal year ended january and respectively for fiscal the decline in roa wa primarily due to the decrease in consolidated net income resulting from the billion net loss related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and also the billion net unrealized loss on our jd com investment for fiscal the decline in roa wa primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt and the decrease in operating income roi wa for fiscal which wa flat compared to fiscal define roi adjusted operating income operating income plus interest income depreciation and amortization and rent expense for the trailing month divided by average invested capital during that period we consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total asset plus average accumulated depreciation and average amortization le average account payable and average accrued liability for that period plus rent factor equal to the rent for the fiscal year or trailing month multiplied by factor of our calculation of roi is considered non gaap financial measure because we calculate roi using financial measure that exclude and include amount that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure for example we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of roi in addition we include factor of for rent expense that estimate the hypothetical capitalization of our operating lease mentioned above we consider roa to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle most directly comparable to our calculation of roi roi differs from roa which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total asset for the period because roi adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense item and add interest income adjusts total asset for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization account payable and accrued liability and incorporates factor of rent to arrive at total invested capital because of the adjustment mentioned above we believe roi more accurately measure how we are deploying our key asset and is more meaningful to investor than roa although roi is standard financial measure numerous method exist for calculating company roi result the method used by management to calculate our roi may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their roi beginning in fiscal our calculation of roi will change upon adoption of asu lease primarily to replace the factor of for rent expense with gaap operating lease asset the calculation of roa and roi along with reconciliation of roi to the calculation of roa the most comparable gaap financial measure is follows fiscal year ended january amount in million of return on assetsnumerator consolidated net income average total asset on asset roa calculation of return on investmentnumerator operating income interest income depreciation and amortization rent adjusted operating income denominator average total asset average accumulated depreciation and amortization average account payable average accrued liability rent average invested capital on investment roi of january balance sheet data total asset depreciation and amortization payable liability the average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing by free cash flowfree cash flow is considered non gaap financial measure management belief however that free cash flow which measure our ability to generate additional cash from our business operation is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the company financial performance free cash flow should be considered in addition to rather than substitute for consolidated net income measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activity measure of our liquidity see liquidity and capital resource for discussion of gaap metric including net cash provided by operating activity net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity we define free cash flow net cash provided by operating activity in period minus payment for property and equipment made in that period we had net cash provided by operating activity of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively we generated free cash flow of billion billion and billion for fiscal and respectively net cash provided by operating activity for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal primarily due to timing of vendor payment partially offset by lower tax payment mainly resulting from tax reform enacted on december tax reform and the timing of tax payment free cash flow for fiscal declined when compared to fiscal due to the same reason the decline in net cash provided by operating activity well billion in increased capital expenditure the decrease in net cash provided by operating activity and free cash flow in fiscal from fiscal were primarily due to the timing of tax and other payment well lapping the previous year improvement in working capital management and the benefit from the application of tax regulation adopted in fiscal walmart definition of free cash flow is limited in that it doe not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditure due to the fact that the measure doe not deduct the payment required for debt service and other contractual obligation or payment made for business acquisition therefore we believe it is important to view free cash flow measure that provides supplemental information to our consolidated statement of cash flow other company report their free cash flow numerous method may exist for calculating company free cash flow result the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the method used by other company to calculate their free cash flow the following table set forth reconciliation of free cash flow non gaap financial measure to net cash provided by operating activity which we believe to be the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow well information regarding net cash used in investing activity and net cash used in financing activity fiscal year ended january amount in million cash provided by operating activity for property and equipment free cash flow net cash used in investing activity net cash used in financing activity net cash used in investing activity includes payment for property and equipment which is also included in our computation of free cash flow result of operationsconsolidated result of operation fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count revenue change from comparable period

at period end total revenue which are mostly comprised of net sale but also include membership and other income increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year net sale increased billion or and billion or for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal net sale were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sale for walmart and sam club segment along with positive comparable sale in the majority of our international market and net sale from flipkart which we acquired in the third quarter of fiscal additionally for fiscal the increase in net sale wa partially offset by billion decrease in net sale due to club closure in the sam club segment during fiscal billion reduction in net sale due to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil in the international segment and billion of negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate for fiscal net sale were positively impacted by overall positive comparable sale the impact from new store opening and sale generated from ecommerce acquisition the positive effect of such factor on our consolidated net sale for fiscal wa partially offset by reduction in net sale of billion due to divesting our yihaodian and suburbia business and the billion of negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate our gross profit rate decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease wa due to the mix effect from our growing ecommerce business the consolidation of flipkart our planned pricing strategy and increased transportation expense for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effect from our growing ecommerce business membership and other income decreased for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year primarily due to the prior year recognition of million gain from the sale of suburbia in our international segment membership and other income wa relatively flat for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year while fiscal included million gain from the sale of suburbia along with million gain from land sale higher recycling income from our sustainability effort and higher membership income from increased plus member penetration at sam club these gain were offset by gain recognized in fiscal for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale decreased basis point when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year the primary driver of the expense leverage were strong sale performance in conjunction with productivity improvement and lapping fiscal charge discussed in the following paragraph the improvement in fiscal were partially offset by additional investment in ecommerce and technology well million charge related to security class action lawsuit for fiscal operating expense percentage of net sale increased basis point when compared to the previous fiscal year while our increase in net sale and improving expense management had positive impact on our operating expense percentage of net sale we did not leverage expense result of approximately billion in charge related to sam club closure and discontinued real estate project million related to lump sum bonus paid to associate million related to home office severance the legal accrual of million related to the fcpa matter charge of million related to discontinued real estate project in walmart and the decision to exit certain international property and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operation other loss were billion for fiscal primarily the result of the billion pre tax loss on the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and billion pre tax decrease in the market value of our investment in jd com fiscal result included loss on extinguishment of debt of billion our effective income tax rate wa for fiscal for fiscal and for fiscal although the statutory rate wa lowered due to the tax cut and job act of the tax act our effective income tax rate increased in fiscal primarily because we recognized minimal tax benefit related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil and flipkart result additionally our effective income tax rate may also fluctuate result of factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix and size of earnings among our operation and international operation which are subject to statutory rate that beginning in fiscal are generally higher than the statutory rate the reconciliation from the statutory rate to the effective income tax rate for fiscal and is presented in note in the note to consolidated financial statement result of the factor discussed above we reported billion and billion of consolidated net income for fiscal and respectively which represents decrease of billion and billion for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year diluted net income per common share attributable to walmart eps wa and for fiscal and respectively segment

sale for fiscal and additionally for fiscal year over year growth in retail square foot further contributed to the year over year increase gross profit rate decreased and basis point for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to our planned pricing strategy increased transportation expense and the mix effect from our growing ecommerce business for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to our planned pricing strategy and the mix effect from our growing ecommerce business partially offsetting the negative factor for fiscal wa the positive impact of saving from procuring merchandise operating expense percentage of segment net sale decreased basis point for fiscal and wa relatively flat for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in fiscal wa primarily due to strong sale performance in conjunction with productivity improvement and the prior year comparable period including charge related to discontinued real estate project of million these improvement more than offset investment in ecommerce technology and omni channel initiative and raising the starting wage rate at the beginning of fiscal result of the factor discussed above segment operating income increased million for fiscal and wa relatively flat for fiscal respectively when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year walmart international segment fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count sale change from comparable period operating income income percentage of net sale unit count at period

billion reduction in net sale due to our sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil billion negative impact from fluctuation in currency exchange rate the continued wind down of our first party brazil ecommerce operation and reduction in net sale of million due to divesting our suburbia business in the second quarter of fiscal for fiscal the increase in net sale wa due to positive comparable

the million gain from the sale of suburbia and million gain from land sale these gain were le than gain recognized in fiscal which included million gain from the sale of our yihaodian business and million gain from the sale of shopping mall in chile expense percentage of segment net sale decreased basis point for fiscal and wa flat for when compared to the previous fiscal year the decrease in operating expense percentage of segment net sale for fiscal wa primarily due to impairment charge in the previous fiscal year of approximately billion which included charge from decision to exit certain property and wind down the first party brazil ecommerce operation this decrease in operating expense wa partially offset by the addition of operating expense from flipkart in fiscal while fiscal wa benefited by an increase in net sale this benefit wa offset by restructuring and impairment charge in certain market of approximately billion including charge from decision to exit certain

segment fiscal year ended january amount in million except unit count fuel net sale change from comparable period calendar comparable sale increase operating income income percentage of net sale unit count at period end square foot at period end excluding fuel net sale change from comparable period operating income income percentage of net sale we believe the excluding fuel information is useful to investor because it permit investor to understand the effect of the sam club segment fuel sale on it result of operation which are impacted by the volatility of fuel price volatility in fuel price may continue to impact the operating result of the sam club segment in the future net sale for the sam club segment decreased billion or for fiscal and increased billion or for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease wa primarily due to billion decrease in net sale resulting from the net closure of club during fiscal well reduced tobacco sale due to our decision to

to comparable sale for fiscal gross profit rate wa relatively flat for fiscal and decreased basis point for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal gross profit rate wa benefited by lapping the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closure in fiscal and decreased tobacco sale in fiscal which have lower margin this benefit to the gross profit rate wa offset by higher transportation cost and ecommerce shipping cost investment in price and increased shrink in fiscal for fiscal the decrease in gross profit rate wa primarily due to the impact of markdowns to liquidate inventory related to club closure reclassification of certain supply expense from operating expense to cost of good sold increased shrink increased ecommerce shipping cost and the investment in cash reward membership and other income increased and for fiscal and respectively when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the increase wa due to an increase of in membership income resulting from increased plus member penetration and gain on property sale these increase were partially offset by lower recycling income when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the

penetration operating expense percentage of segment net sale decreased basis point for fiscal and increased basis point for fiscal when compared to the previous fiscal year for fiscal the decrease in operating expense percentage of segment net sale wa primarily due to charge of approximately billion in the prior year comparable period related to club closure and discontinued real estate project

material liability upon their final resolution summary of critical accounting estimatesmanagement strives to report our financial result in clear and understandable manner although in some case accounting and disclosure rule are complex and require to use technical terminology in preparing the company consolidated financial statement we follow accounting principle generally accepted in the these principle require to make certain estimate and apply judgment that affect our financial position and result of operation reflected in our financial statement these judgment and estimate are based on past event and expectation of future outcome actual result may differ from our estimate management continually review our accounting policy how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statement following is summary of our critical accounting estimate and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statement inventorieswe value inventory at the lower of cost or market determined primarily by the retail inventory method of accounting using the last in first out lifo method for walmart segment inventory the inventory at the sam club segment is valued using the weighted average cost lifo method when necessary we record lifo provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation and these estimate are adjusted to actual result determined at year end our lifo provision is calculated based on inventory level markup rate and internally generated retail price index measure of sensitivity increase to our retail price index would not have resulted in decrease to the carrying value of inventory of january and our inventory valued at lifo approximated those inventory if they were valued at fifo impairment of assetswe evaluate long lived asset for indicator of impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying amount may not be recoverable management judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator are based on market condition and financial performance the evaluation of long lived asset is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow which is generally at the individual store level the variability of these factor depends on number of condition including uncertainty about future event and change in demographic thus our accounting estimate may change from period to period these factor could cause management to conclude that indicator of impairment exist and require impairment test be performed which could result in management determining the value of long lived asset is impaired resulting in write down of the related long lived asset while fiscal included pre tax loss of billion related to the sale of the majority stake in walmart brazil which included full impairment of all related asset there were no other material impairment charge for fiscal measure of sensitivity fiscal impairment would not change materially with decrease in the undiscounted cash flow for the store or club with indicator of impairment for fiscal although impairment charge were billion these charge primarily related to restructuring activity described in note well discontinued real estate project in the and decision to exit certain international property impairment charge not related to restructuring activity or decision to exit property for fiscal and were not material combination goodwill and acquired intangible assetswe account for business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that control is obtained all the asset acquired and liability assumed including amount attributable to noncontrolling interest be recorded at their respective fair value at the date of acquisition the determination of fair value of identifiable asset and liability requires estimate and the use of valuation technique when market value is not readily available for intangible asset acquired in business combination we typically use the income method significant estimate in valuing certain intangible asset include but are not limited to the amount and timing of future cash flow growth rate discount rate and useful life the excess of the purchase price over fair value of identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition component within the same reportable segment are aggregated and deemed single reporting unit if the component have similar economic characteristic of january our reporting unit consisted of walmart walmart international and sam club goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible asset are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the value of certain asset may be impaired generally this evaluation begin with qualitative assessment to determine whether quantitative impairment test is necessary if we determine after performing an assessment based on the qualitative factor that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not le than the carrying amount or that fair value of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount can not be assured then quantitative impairment test would be performed the quantitative test for impairment requires management to make judgment relating to future cash flow growth rate and economic and market condition these evaluation are based on determining the fair value of reporting unit or asset using valuation method such discounted cash flow or relative market based approach historically our reporting unit and other indefinite lived acquired intangible asset have generated sufficient return to recover the cost of goodwill and other indefinite lived acquired intangible asset because of the nature of the factor used in these test if different condition occur in future period future operating result could be materially impacted for approximately million of certain acquired indefinite lived intangible asset the fair value approximated the carrying value any deterioration in the fair value may result in an impairment charge income taxesincome tax have significant effect on our net earnings we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction accordingly the determination of our provision for income tax requires significant judgment the use of estimate and the interpretation and application of complex tax law our effective income tax rate is affected by many factor including change in our assessment of certain tax contingency increase and decrease in valuation allowance change in tax law outcome of administrative audit the impact of discrete item and the mix of earnings among our and international operation where the statutory rate are generally lower than the statutory rate and may fluctuate result our tax return are routinely audited and settlement of issue raised in these audit sometimes affect our tax provision the benefit of uncertain tax position are recorded in our financial statement only after determining more likely than not probability that the uncertain tax position will withstand challenge if any from taxing authority when fact and circumstance change we reassess these probability and record any change in the financial statement appropriate we account for uncertain tax position by determining the minimum recognition threshold that tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statement this determination requires the use of significant judgment in evaluating our tax position and assessing the timing and amount of deductible and taxable item deferred tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax asset are evaluated for future realization and reduced by valuation allowance to the extent that portion is not more likely than not to be realized many factor are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized including recent cumulative earnings expectation of future taxable income carryforward period and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factor the recoverability of the deferred tax asset is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy this evaluation relies heavily on estimate on december the tax cut and job act of the tax act wa enacted and contains significant change to income tax law effective beginning january the tax act reduced the statutory tax rate from to and created new tax on foreign sourced earnings and related party payment discussed in note to our
