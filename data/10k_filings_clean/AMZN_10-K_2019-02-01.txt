limit our growth and negatively affect our operating result we may experience significant fluctuation in our operating result and growth ratewe may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate we base our expense level and investment plan on sale estimate significant portion of our expense and investment is fixed and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sale are le than expected our revenue growth may not be sustainable and our percentage growth rate may decrease our revenue and operating profit growth depends on the continued growth of demand for the product and service offered by or our seller and our business is affected by general economic and business condition worldwide softening of demand whether caused by change in customer preference or weakening of the or global economy may result in decreased revenue or growth our sale and operating result will also fluctuate for many other reason including due to risk described elsewhere in this section and the following our ability to retain and increase sale to existing customer attract new customer and satisfy our customer demand our ability to retain and expand our network of seller our ability to offer product on favorable term manage inventory and fulfill order the introduction of competitive store website product service price decrease or improvement change in usage or adoption rate of the internet commerce electronic device and web service including outside the of content timing effectiveness and cost of expansion and upgrade of our system and infrastructure the success of our

our service is affected by spyware virus phishing and other spam email denial of service attack data theft computer intrusion outage and similar event and terrorist attack and armed hostility our international operation expose to number of risksour international activity are significant to our revenue and profit and we plan to expand internationally in certain international market segment we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantage or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operation and store and promote our brand internationally our international operation may not be profitable on sustained basis in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international sale and operation are subject to number of risk including local economic and political condition government regulation such regulation of our product and service offering and of competition restrictive governmental action such trade protection measure including export duty and quota and custom duty and tariff nationalization and restriction on foreign ownership restriction on sale or distribution of certain product or service and uncertainty regarding liability for product service and content including uncertainty result of le internet friendly legal system local law lack of legal precedent and varying rule regulation and practice regarding the physical and digital distribution of medium product and enforcement of intellectual property right business licensing or certification requirement such for import export web service and electronic device limitation on the repatriation and investment of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycle and the resultant negative impact on cash flow law and regulation regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payment and restriction on pricing or discount lower level of use of the internet lower level of consumer spending and fewer opportunity for growth compared to the lower level of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation result of distance language and cultural difference of content different employee employer relationship and the existence of work council and labor union compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act and other applicable and foreign law prohibiting corrupt payment to government official and other third party law and policy of the and other jurisdiction affecting trade foreign investment loan and tax and geopolitical event including war and terrorism international physical commerce and omnichannel retail and other service grow competition will intensify including through adoption of evolving business model local company may have substantial competitive advantage of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer well their more established local brand name we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth the people republic of china prc and india regulate amazon and it affiliate business and operation in country through regulation and license requirement that may restrict foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data center retail delivery and other sector ii internet content and iii the sale of medium and other product and service for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirement www amazon cn is operated by prc company that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc national in addition we provide certain technology service in china in conjunction with third party that hold prc license to provide service in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian company by foreign entity involved in online multi brand retail trading activity for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tool and logistics service to third party seller to enable them to sell online and deliver to customer and we hold indirect minority interest in entity that are third party seller on the www amazon in marketplace although we believe these structure and activity comply with existing law they involve unique risk and the prc and india are actively considering change in their foreign investment rule that could impact these structure and activity are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation of prc and indian law and regulation and it is possible that these government will ultimately take view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian business and operation may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliate are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationship with respect to management and control of such business if our international activity were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other law or regulation or if interpretation of those law and regulation were to change our business in those country could be subject to fine and other financial penalty have license revoked or be forced to restructure our operation or shut entirely if we not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data center our business could be harmedif we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data center successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased cost impairment charge or or harm our business in other way we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new business with different requirement our fulfillment and data center network become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively in addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipment we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center if the other business on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment service deliver product to our fulfillment center in excess of forecast we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network we rely on limited number of shipping company to deliver inventory to and completed order to our customer if we are not able to negotiate acceptable term with these company or they experience performance problem or other difficulty it could negatively impact our operating result and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed order to customer also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquake labor dispute act of war or terrorism act of god and similar factor under some of our commercial agreement we maintain the inventory of other company thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other company to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected cost and other harm to our business and reputation of contentsthe seasonality of our business place increased strain on our operationswe expect disproportionate amount of our net sale to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular product in sufficient amount such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock product we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment cost which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrade split shipment and additional long zone shipment necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if many customer access our website within short period of time due to increased demand we may experience system interruption that make our website unavailable or prevent from efficiently fulfilling order which may reduce the volume of good we sell and the attractiveness of our product and service in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center during these peak period and delivery and other fulfillment company and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risk described elsewhere in this item relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory we generally have payment term with our retail vendor that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customer result of holiday sale of december of each year our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance typically reach their highest level other than result of cash flow provided by or used in investing and financing activity this operating cycle result in corresponding increase in account payable of december our account payable balance generally decline during the first three month of the year resulting in corresponding decline in our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining commercial agreement strategic alliance and other business relationshipswe provide physical commerce and omnichannel retail and other service to business through commercial agreement strategic alliance and business relationship under these agreement we provide web service technology fulfillment computing digital storage and other service well enable seller to offer product or service through our store these arrangement are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity personnel and other resource commitment which may limit the amount of business we can service we may not be able to implement maintain and develop the component of these commercial relationship which may include web service fulfillment customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and third party software and engaging third party to perform service the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreement is partially dependent on the volume of the other company sale therefore if the other company offering are not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationship and strategic alliance on favorable term we also may be subject to claim from business to which we provide these service if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these service our agreement terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these agreement on comparable term or at all we may in the future enter into amendment on le favorable term or encounter party that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligation to which could adversely affect our operating result our present and future commerce service agreement other commercial agreement and strategic alliance create additional risk such disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing business impairment of other relationship variability in revenue and income from entering into amending or terminating such agreement or relationship and difficulty integrating under the commercial agreement our business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making integrating and maintaining acquisition and investmentswe have acquired and invested in number of company and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint venture with additional company these transaction such our acquisition of whole food market inc create risk such disruption of our ongoing business including loss of management focus on existing business problem

operation the difficulty of completing such transaction and achieving anticipated benefit within expected timeframes or at all the difficulty of incorporating acquired operation technology and right into our offering and unanticipated expense related to such integration the difficulty of integrating new company accounting financial reporting management information and information security human resource and other administrative system to permit effective management and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented for investment in which an investee financial performance is incorporated into our financial result either in full or in part the dependence on the investee accounting financial reporting and similar system control and process the difficulty of implementing at company we acquire the control procedure and policy appropriate for larger public company the risk associated with business we acquire or invest in which may differ from or be more significant than the risk our other business face potential unknown liability associated with company we acquire or in which we invest and for foreign transaction additional risk related to the integration of operation across different culture and language and the economic political and regulatory risk associated with specific country result of future acquisition or merger we might need to issue additional equity security spend our cash or incur debt contingent liability or amortization expense related to intangible asset any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or be available on unfavorable term if at all in addition valuation supporting our acquisition and strategic investment could change rapidly given the current global economic climate we could determine that such valuation have experienced impairment or other than temporary decline in fair value which could adversely impact our financial result we have foreign exchange riskthe result of operation of and certain of our intercompany balance associated with our international store and product and service offering are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuation upon translation operating result may differ materially from expectation and we may record significant gain or loss on the remeasurement of intercompany balance we have expanded our international operation our exposure to exchange rate fluctuation ha increased we also hold cash equivalent and or marketable security in foreign currency including british pound euro and japanese yen if the dollar strengthens compared to these currency cash equivalent and marketable security balance when translated may be materially le than expected and vice versa the loss of key senior management personnel or the failure to hire and retain highly skilled and other key personnel could negatively affect our businesswe depend on our senior management and other key personnel particularly jeffrey bezos our president ceo and chairman we do not have key person life insurance policy we also rely on other highly skilled personnel competition for qualified personnel in the technology industry ha historically been intense particularly for software engineer computer scientist and other technical staff the loss of any of our executive officer or other key employee or the inability to hire train retain and manage qualified personnel could harm our business we could be harmed by data loss or other security breachesbecause we process store and transmit large amount of data including personal information failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breach including breach of our vendor or customer technology and system could expose or our customer to risk of loss or misuse of such information adversely affect our operating result result in litigation or potential liability for deter customer or seller from using our store and service and otherwise harm our business and reputation we use third party technology and system for variety of reason including without limitation encryption and authentication technology employee email content delivery to customer back office support and other function some of our system have experienced past security breach and although they not have material adverse effect on our operating result there can be no assurance of similar result in the future although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breach including of contentssystems and process designed to reduce the impact of security breach at third party vendor or customer such measure can not provide absolute security we face risk related to system interruption and lack of redundancywe experience occasional system interruption and delay that make our website and service unavailable or slow to respond and prevent from efficiently fulfilling order or providing service to third party which may reduce our net sale and the attractiveness of our product and service if we are unable to continually add software and hardware effectively upgrade our system and network infrastructure and take other step to improve the efficiency of our system it could cause system interruption or delay and adversely affect our operating result our computer and communication system and operation could be damaged or interrupted by fire flood power loss telecommunication failure earthquake act of war or terrorism act of god computer virus physical or electronic break in and similar event or disruption any of these event could cause system interruption delay and loss of critical data and could prevent from accepting and fulfilling customer order and providing service which could make our product and service offering le attractive and subject to liability our system are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient in addition we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related loss any of these event could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy we face significant inventory riskin addition to risk described elsewhere in this

product launch rapid change in product cycle and pricing defective merchandise change in consumer demand and consumer spending pattern change in consumer taste with respect to our product spoilage and other factor we endeavor to accurately predict these trend and avoid overstocking or understocking product we manufacture and or sell demand for product however can change significantly between the time inventory or component are ordered and the date of sale in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing new product it may be difficult to establish vendor relationship determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain type of inventory or component may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable we carry broad selection and significant inventory level of certain product such consumer electronics and we may be unable to sell product in sufficient quantity or during the relevant selling season any one of the inventory risk factor set forth may adversely affect our operating result we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property right or may be accused of infringing

information about the likely method of disposition such through sale to individual customer return to product vendor or liquidation and expected recoverable value of each disposition category these assumption about future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material write down in the future measure of sensitivity for

foreign currency were billion billion and billion of december and and were primarily euro british pound and japanese yen cash provided by used in operating activity wa billion billion and billion in and our operating cash flow result primarily from cash received from our consumer seller developer enterprise and content creator customer and advertiser offset by cash payment we make for product and service employee compensation payment processing and related transaction cost operating lease and interest payment on our long term obligation cash received from our customer and other activity generally corresponds to our net sale because consumer primarily use credit card to buy from our receivables from consumer settle quickly the increase in operating cash flow in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to the increase in net income excluding non cash charge such depreciation amortization and stock based compensation cash provided by used in operating activity is also subject to change in working capital working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variable including seasonality inventory management and category expansion the timing of cash receipt and payment vendor payment term and fluctuation in foreign exchange rate cash provided by used in investing activity corresponds with cash capital expenditure including leasehold

security cash provided by used in investing activity wa billion billion and billion in and with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisition our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment and purchase maturity and sale of marketable security cash capital expenditure were billion billion and billion in and which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment operation and additional investment in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure the majority of which is to support aws during all three year in and we made cash

billion in and property and equipment acquired under capital lease wa billion billion and billion in and with the increase reflecting investment in support of continued business growth primarily due to investment in technology infrastructure for aws which investment we expect to continue over time cash inflow from financing activity primarily result from proceeds from long term debt and other proceeds from long term debt and other were million billion and million in and during cash inflow from financing activity consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of billion of senior unsecured note in seven tranche maturing in through the proceeds from note issued in august the august note were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of whole food market to repay note due in and for general corporate purpose of contentsin april we established commercial paper program the commercial paper program under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to total of billion at any time with individual maturity that may vary but will not exceed day from the date of issue there were no borrowing outstanding under the commercial paper program of

amount of december cash cash equivalent and marketable security held by foreign subsidiary wa billion we have tax benefit relating to excess stock based compensation deduction and accelerated

we had approximately billion of federal tax credit potentially available to offset future tax liability our federal tax credit are primarily related to the federal research and development credit we utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit we expect cash paid for tax to increase we endeavor to manage our global tax on cash basis rather than on financial reporting basis in connection with the european commission october decision against on state aid luxembourg tax authority computed an initial recovery amount consistent with the european commission decision of approximately million that we deposited into escrow in march subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeal our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balance that are pledged collateral for real estate lease amount due to third party seller in certain jurisdiction debt and standby and trade letter of credit to the extent we process payment for third party seller or offer certain type of stored value to our customer some jurisdiction may restrict our use of those fund these restriction would result in the reclassification of portion of our cash and cash equivalent from cash and cash equivalent to restricted cash which is classified within account receivable net and other on our consolidated balance sheet of december and restricted cash cash equivalent and marketable security were

asset additionally purchase obligation and open purchase order consisting of inventory and significant non inventory commitment were billion of december these purchase obligation and open purchase order are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provision we believe that cash flow generated from operation and our cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance well our borrowing arrangement will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash need for at least the next month however any projection of future cash need and cash flow are subject to substantial uncertainty see item of part risk factor we continually evaluate opportunity to sell additional equity or debt security obtain credit facility obtain capital finance and operating lease arrangement repurchase common stock pay dividend or repurchase refinance or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reason or to further strengthen our financial position the sale of additional equity or convertible debt security would likely be dilutive to our shareholder in addition we will from time to time consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary business product service capital infrastructure and technology which might affect our liquidity requirement or cause to secure additional financing or issue additional equity or debt security there can be no assurance that additional credit line or financing instrument will be available in amount or on term acceptable to if at all of contentsresults of operationswe have organized our operation into three segment

and billion for and we believe that operating income loss is more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product category and service the increase in north america operating income in absolute dollar in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to increased unit sale including sale by third party seller advertising sale and slower growth in certain operating expense partially offset by cost to expand our fulfillment network change in foreign exchange rate impacted operating income by million million and million for and the decrease in

equipment cost and inbound and outbound shipping cost including where we are the transportation service provider the increase in cost of sale in absolute dollar in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to increased product and shipping cost resulting from increased sale shipping cost to receive product from our supplier are included in our inventory and recognized cost of sale upon sale of product to our customer shipping cost which include sortation and delivery center and transportation cost were billion billion and billion in and we expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customer accept and use our shipping offer at an increasing rate we reduce shipping rate we use more expensive shipping method and we offer additional service we seek to mitigate cost of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sale volume optimizing our fulfillment network negotiating better term with our supplier and achieving better operating efficiency we believe that offering low price to our customer is fundamental to our future success and one way we offer lower price is through shipping offer cost to operate our aws segment are

cost primarily consist of those cost incurred in operating and staffing our north america and international fulfillment center customer service center and physical store and payment processing cost

several factor such payment processing and related transaction cost our level of productivity and accuracy change in volume size and weight of unit received and fulfilled timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion the extent we utilize fulfillment service provided by third party mix of product and service sold and our ability to affect customer service contact per unit by implementing improvement in our operation and enhancement to our customer self service feature additionally because payment processing and fulfillment cost associated with seller transaction are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transaction and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment cost are higher percentage of sale versus our retail sale sale by our seller have higher fulfillment cost percent of net sale the increase in fulfillment cost in absolute dollar in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to cost from expanding our fulfillment network which includes physical store and variable cost corresponding with increased product and service sale volume and inventory level we seek to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate greater selection and in stock inventory level and to meet anticipated shipment volume from sale of our own product well sale by third party for which we provide the fulfillment service we regularly evaluate our facility requirement marketingwe direct customer to our store primarily through number of targeted online marketing channel such our sponsored search third party customer referral social and online advertising television advertising and other initiative our marketing cost are largely variable based on growth in sale and change in rate to the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic source or to the extent our mix of these channel shift we would expect to see corresponding change in our marketing cost the increase in marketing cost in absolute dollar in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to payroll and related expense for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activity well increased spending on online marketing channel while cost associated with amazon prime membership and other shipping offer are not included in marketing expense we view these offer effective worldwide marketing tool and intend to continue offering

and technology infrastructure these cost are allocated to segment based on usage the increase in technology and content cost in absolute dollar in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related cost associated with technical team responsible for expanding our existing product and service and initiative to introduce new product and service offering general and administrativethe increase in general and administrative cost in absolute dollar in and compared to the comparable prior year is primarily due to increase in payroll and related expense of contentsother operating expense netother operating expense net wa million million and million during and and is primarily related to the

regulation case law and administrative practice principle and interpretation related to tax including change to the global tax framework competition and other law and accounting rule in various jurisdiction and relative change of expense or loss for which tax benefit are not recognized additionally our effective tax rate can be more or le volatile based on the amount of pre tax income or loss for example the impact of discrete item and non deductible expense on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre tax income is lower the tax act wa signed into law on december the tax act significantly revised the corporate income tax by among other thing lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from to eliminating certain deduction imposing mandatory one time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiary introducing new tax regime and changing how foreign earnings are subject to tax the tax act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deduction by allowing full expensing of qualified property primarily equipment through we reasonably estimated the effect of the tax act and recorded provisional amount in our financial statement of december we recorded provisional tax benefit for the impact of the tax act of approximately million this amount wa primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liability resulting from the permanent reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate to from after taking into account the mandatory one time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiary the amount
