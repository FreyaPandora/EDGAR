regulate or influence debit and credit interchange reimbursement rate in their region for example the dodd frank act in the limit interchange reimbursement rate for certain debit card transaction the interchange fee regulation ifr limit interchange rate in europe discussed below and the reserve bank of australia ha regulated average permissible level of interchange for over decade network exclusivity and routing in the the dodd frank act limit network exclusivity and preferred routing for the debit and prepaid market segment other jurisdiction impose similar limitation such the ifr prohibition on restriction that prevent multiple payment brand or functionality on the same card no surcharge rule we have historically enforced rule that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using visa product instead of other mean however merchant ability to surcharge varies by geographic market well visa product type and continues to be impacted by litigation regulation and legislation privacy and data protection aspect of our operation or business are subject to privacy data use and data security regulation which impact the way we use and handle data operate our product and service and even of contentsimpact our ability to offer product or service in addition regulator are proposing new law or regulation which could require visa to adopt certain cybersecurity practice in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach and such notification requirement continue to increase in scope and cost the european union general data protection regulation which will become effective in may will create new individual privacy right and impose worldwide obligation on company handling personal data anti corruption anti money

regulatory agency also continue to examine wide variety of other issue including mobile payment transaction tokenization money transfer identity theft account management guideline disclosure rule

the financial stability of the visa europe is also subject to the eurosystem oversight including the security of payment instrument and ecommerce security policy and scheme rule furthermore visa europe is regulated by the payment system regulator psr which ha wide ranging power and authority to review our business practice system rule and fee with respect to promoting competition and innovation in the and ensuring payment meet account holder need it also is the regulator responsible for monitoring and enforcing the ifr in the outside the in relation to ifr visa is also subject to compliance monitoring by national competent authority in all market the ifr regulates interchange rate within europe requires visa europe to separate it payment card scheme activity from processing activity for accounting organization and decision making purpose within the and imposes limitation on network exclusivity and routing there are other regulation in the that impact our business

report filed with or furnished to the sec item risk factor regulatory risk of contentsincreased regulation of the global payment industry including with respect to interchange reimbursement fee operating rule and related practice could harm our business regulator around the world have been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate certain aspect of the payment industry see item business government regulation for more information in the and many other jurisdiction we have historically set default interchange reimbursement fee even though we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fee in purchase transaction those fee are paid by the acquirer to the issuer interchange reimbursement fee are factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process consequently change to these fee whether voluntarily or by mandate can substantially affect our overall payment volume and revenue interchange reimbursement fee certain operating rule and related practice continue to be subject to increased government regulation globally and regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing these fee rule and practice for example in in accordance with the dodd frank act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate received by large financial institution at cent plus basis point plus possible fraud adjustment of cent this amounted to significant reduction in the average system wide interchange reimbursement fee received by large issuer the dodd frank act also limited issuer and our ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area which also impacted our business in the ifr placed an effective cap on consumer credit and consumer debit interchange fee for both domestic and cross border transaction basis point and basis point respectively significantly reducing the fee received by issuer member state have the ability to further restrict these interchange level within their territory more recently in september argentina senate approved bill to reduce existing cap on the merchant discount rate charged by acquirer to for credit transaction and zero for debit transaction in addition to the regulation of interchange reimbursement fee number of regulator impose restriction on other aspect of our payment business for example government regulation or pressure may require or allow other network to be supported by visa product or service or to have the other network functionality or brand mark on our product innovation in payment technology have enabled to expand into new product and service they have also expanded the potential scope of regulatory influence in addition the requirement to separate scheme and processing add cost and could impact the efficient integration of visa europe the execution of our commercial innovation and product strategy our ability to provide effective customer service and the amount of data available for use in fraud and risk system and loyalty service we are also subject to central bank oversight in the and the this oversight could result in new governance reporting licensing cybersecurity processing infrastructure capital or credit risk management requirement we could also be required to adopt policy and practice designed to mitigate settlement and liquidity risk including increased requirement to maintain sufficient level of capital and financial resource locally increased central bank oversight could also lead to new or different criterion for financial institution participation in and access to our payment system additionally regulator in other jurisdiction are considering or adopting approach based on similar regulatory principle regulator around the world increasingly take note of each other approach to regulating the payment industry consequently development in one jurisdiction may influence regulatory approach in another the risk created by new law or regulation in one jurisdiction have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another jurisdiction or in other product offering the dodd frank act and the ifr are development with such potential are approach taken by regulator in australia canada and other country see note legal matter of this report similarly new regulation involving one product offering may prompt regulator to extend the regulation to other product offering for example credit payment could become subject to the same regulation debit payment additionally regulation in an individual country could continue and expand for example in australia the reserve bank of australia rba initially capped credit interchange but subsequently capped debit interchange well when we can not set default interchange reimbursement rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer may find our payment system le attractive this may increase the attractiveness of other payment system such our competitor closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer we believe some issuer may react to such regulation by charging new or higher fee to consumer making our product le appealing to consumer some acquirer may elect to charge higher merchant discount rate regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchant not to accept our product or to steer customer to alternate of contentspayments system or form of payment in addition in an effort to reduce the expense of their card program some issuer and acquirer have obtained and may continue to obtain incentive from and reduction in the fee that we charge which may directly impact our revenue for these reason increased global regulation of the payment industry may make our product le desirable diminish our ability to compete reduce our transaction volume and harm our business government imposed restriction on payment system may prevent from competing against provider in certain country government in various jurisdiction such in asia and the gulf cooperation country in the middle east protect certain domestic payment card network brand and processor these government may impose regulatory requirement that favor domestic provider or that mandate domestic payment processing be done entirely in that country which would prevent from overseeing the end to end processing of certain transaction in china for example unionpay continues to enjoy advantage over other international network remains the sole processor of domestic payment card transaction and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark though the chinese state council ha announced that international scheme such visa would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for license to operate bank card clearing institution bcci in china the full implementation guideline for bcci have yet to be finalized in russia legislation ha effectively prevented from processing in the domestic market and mandated that we migrate our domestic processing business to the state owned nspk or national payment card system which is the only entity allowed to process domestically due to our inability to oversee the end to end processing of transaction for card carrying our brand in these country we depend on our close working relationship with our client or third party processor in these region to ensure transaction involving our product are processed effectively national law that protect domestic processing may increase our cost decrease the number of visa product issued or processed impede from utilizing our global processing capability and control the quality of the service supporting our brand restrict our activity force to leave country or prevent from entering new market all of which could harm our ability to operate our business maintain or increase our revenue globally and extend our global brand we are subject to complex and evolving global regulation that could harm our business and financial result global payment technology company we are subject to complex and evolving regulation that govern our operation see item business government regulation for more information on the most significant area of regulation that affect our business the impact of these regulation on and on our client and other third party could limit our ability to enforce our payment system rule or require to adopt new rule or change existing rule and it may increase our compliance cost and reduce our revenue opportunity we may face differing rule and regulation in matter like interchange reimbursement rate preferred routing domestic processing requirement currency conversion point of sale transaction rule and practice privacy data use or protection and associated product technology result the visa rule and our other contractual commitment may differ from country to country or by product offering complying with these and other regulation increase our cost and can reduce our revenue opportunity further regulation change they may affect our existing contractual arrangement if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offering service and fee and other important aspect of our business in the various region where we operate our compliance program and policy are designed to support our compliance with wide array of regulation and law and we continually enhance our compliance program regulation evolve however we can not guarantee that our practice will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authority in the event our control should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reason we could be subject to monetary damage civil and criminal penalty litigation and damage to our global brand and reputation furthermore the evolving and increased regulatory focus on the payment industry could reduce the number of visa product our client issue the volume of payment we process and our revenue negatively impact our brand and our competitive positioning and limit the type of product and service that we offer the country in which our product are used and the type of customer and merchant who can obtain or accept our product all of which could harm our business we may be subject to tax examination or dispute or change in the tax law of contentswe exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may limit their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in dispute with the internal revenue service the hm revenue custom well tax authority in other jurisdiction and we may be subject to additional examination or dispute in the future relevant tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matter could harm our cash flow and financial position in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform or those resulting from the base erosion and profit shifting beps project being conducted by the organization for economic cooperation and development may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax payment could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report litigation riskswe may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigation despite certain protection that are in place we are involved in numerous civil action and government investigation alleging violation of competition and antitrust law consumer protection law and intellectual property law among others detail of the claim and the status of those proceeding are described more fully in note legal matter legal and regulatory proceeding and investigation are inherently uncertain expensive and disruptive to our operation in the event we are found liable in any material litigation proceeding or investigation particularly in large class action lawsuit or an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damage we may be required to pay significant award or settlement in addition settlement term judgment or pressure resulting from legal proceeding or investigation may require to modify the default interchange reimbursement rate we set revise the visa rule or the way in which we enforce our rule modify our fee or pricing or modify the way we do business which may harm our business finally we are required by some of our commercial agreement to indemnify other entity for litigation asserted against them even if visa is not defendant for certain litigation matter like the covered litigation and the territory covered litigation which are described in note and europe retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter we have certain protection provided for in the respective retrospective responsibility plan the two retrospective responsibility plan are different in the protection they provide and the mechanism by which we are able to either fund the settlement and judgment in the case of the covered litigation or recoup covered loss in the case of the ve territory covered litigation the failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plan to adequately insulate from the impact of such settlement judgment loss or liability could materially harm our financial condition or cash flow or even cause to become insolvent business riskswe face intense competition in our industry the global payment space is intensely competitive technology evolves new competitor emerge and existing client and competitor assume different role our product compete with cash check electronic fund virtual currency payment global or multi regional network other closed loop payment system and alternative payment provider primarily focused on enabling payment through ecommerce and mobile channel the global payment space becomes more complex we face increasing competition from our client emerging payment provider and other digital and technology company many of these provider have developed payment system enabled through online activity in ecommerce and mobile channel and are seeking to expand into other channel that compete with or replace our product and service additionally some of our competitor may develop substantially better technology more widely adopted delivery channel or have greater financial resource they may offer wider range of program product and service including some that are more innovative they may use advertising and marketing strategy that are more effective than achieving broader brand recognition and greater issuance and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate in different market segment those business model may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to of contentsregulatory technological and other development in some case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for transaction within certain country and region some of our competitor including american express discover private label card network virtual currency provider technology company that enable the exchange of digital asset and certain alternate payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer government action or initiative such the dodd frank act or the federal reserve faster payment initiative may provide them with increased opportunity to derive competitive advantage from these business model similarly regulation in europe under and in the through the psr may require to open access to and allow participation in our network to additional participant and reduce the infrastructure investment and regulatory burden on potential competitor we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factor such emerging technology including mobile payment alternate payment credential other ledger technology or payment form and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that prefer not to use our payment network for processing payment for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly with issuer and acquirer we expect the competitive landscape to continue to shift and evolve for example competitor client and others are developing alternative payment network or product that could disintermediate from the transaction processing or the value added service we provide to support such processing example include initiative like the clearing house an ach based payment system comprised of large financial institution and ew an alternative to an ach payment system that provides faster fund or real time payment across corporate and government disbursement bill pay and deposit check transaction similarly multiple country are developing or promoting ach based real time payment system or mandating local network with client that also present risk of disintermediation to our business party that process our transaction may try to minimize or eliminate our position in the payment value chain party that access our payment credential token and technology including client technology solution provider or others might be able to migrate account holder and other client to alternate payment method or utilize our payment credential token and technology to establish or help bolster alternate payment method and platform competitor client and others may develop method to use our payment credential token and technology to compete with impair or replace digital payment product that use and support our network and processing over our network we may need to adjust our local rule and practice to remain competitive amidst evolving regulatory landscape and competitor practice we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspect of our payment service for use by our customer processor or other third party thereby increasing operational cost we may need to agree to business arrangement with term le protective of visa proprietary technology and interest in order to compete with others including those with issuer and with competing network participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enable or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service competition may increase from alternate type of payment service such mobile payment service ecommerce payment service payment service faster payment initiative and payment service that permit ach payment or direct debit of consumer checking account of content new player and intermediary in the payment value chain may redirect transaction or steer participant away from our network we may face increasing risk of others asserting their intellectual property right and potential litigation market entrant include technology company and company from industry where patent right are actively asserted this landscape is quickly evolving we may not be able to foresee or respond sufficiently to emerging risk associated with new business product service and practice or new or revised industry standard related to emv chip payment technology cloud based payment tokenization or other technology set by organization such the international organization for standardization american national standard institute and emvco may result in additional cost and expense for visa and it client or otherwise negatively impact the functionality and competitiveness of our product and service our failure to compete effectively in light of any such development could harm our business and prospect for future growth our revenue and profit are dependent on our client and merchant base which may be costly to win retain and maintain our financial institution client and merchant can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service while we have certain contractual protection our client including some of our largest client generally have flexibility to issue non visa product further in certain circumstance our financial institution client may decide to terminate our contractual relationship on relatively short notice without paying significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client the loss of business from any one of these larger client could harm our business result of operation and financial condition in order to stay competitive we offer incentive to our client to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand their use and acceptance of visa product and service these include up front cash payment fee discount and rebate credit performance based incentive marketing and other support payment that impact our revenue and profitability in addition we offer incentive to certain merchant or acquirer to win routing preference in situation where other network functionality is enabled on our product and there is choice of network routing option market pressure on providing incentive fee discount and rebate could moderate our growth if we are not able to implement cost containment and productivity initiative in other area of our business or increase our volume in other way to offset the financial impact of these incentive fee discount and rebate it may harm our net revenue and profit in addition it may be difficult or costly for to acquire or conduct business with financial institution or merchant that have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor these financial institution or merchant may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing client or merchant in addition if there is consolidation or acquisition of one or more of our largest client or co brand partner by financial institution client or merchant with strong relationship with one of our competitor it could result in our business shifting to competitor which could put at competitive disadvantage and harm our business merchant and processor continued push to lower acceptance cost and challenge industry practice could harm our business we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa product certain large retail merchant have been exercising their influence in the global payment system to attempt to lower their acceptance cost by lobbying for new legislation seeking regulatory enforcement filing lawsuit and in some case refusing to accept visa product if they are successful in their effort we may face increased compliance and litigation expense and issuer may decrease their issuance of our product in the the cost of payment card acceptance ha emerged in the context of payment security number of merchant trade association claim that emv card without pin cardholder verification are not worth the investment the october liability shift and ongoing transition to emv resulted in call for pin verification mandate more recently merchant affiliated group and processor have expressed concern regarding the emv certification process some of contentspolicymakers have called upon competition authority to consider potential concern arising from the role of industry body such emvco and the payment card industry security standard council additionally some merchant and processor have pushed for change to industry practice and our requirement for visa acceptance at the point of sale including the ability for merchant to accept only certain type of visa product to mandate only pin authenticated transaction to differentiate or steer among visa product type issued by different financial institution and to impose surcharge on customer presenting visa product their form of payment if successful these effort could adversely impact consumer usage of our product lead to regulatory enforcement and or litigation increase our compliance and litigation expense and harm our business we depend on relationship with our financial institution client acquirer merchant and other third party we depend significantly on relationship with our financial institution client and on their relationship with customer and merchant to support our program and service and thereby compete effectively in the marketplace our relationship with industry participant are complex and require to balance the interest of multiple third party for example in the the emv migration ha been resisted by certain merchant leading to conflict and litigation concerning the timing and scope of the liability shift chargebacks and debit routing among others we engage in discussion with merchant acquirer and processor to provide incentive to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we engage in many payment card co branding effort with merchant who receive incentive from these and other relationship become more prevalent and take on greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to continue to engage in these discussion in order to sustain and grow these relationship in addition we depend on third party including supplier and our financial institution client to provide various service associated with our payment network on our behalf to the extent that such party fail to perform or deliver adequate service our business and reputation could be harmed if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand if event occur that damage our reputation or brand or we experience brand disintermediation it could harm our business our brand are globally recognized and are key asset of our business we believe that our client and customer associate our brand with acceptance security convenience and universality our success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the value of our brand and reputation of our product and service in the payment ecosystem elevate the brand through new and existing product service and partnership and uphold our corporate reputation the increased use or popularity of product that we have developed in partnership with large technology and financial institution company could result in consumer confusion or brand disintermediation and decrease the value of our brand in addition our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted by number of factor including data security breach compliance failure negative perception of our industry or the industry of our client action by client or other third party such sponsorship partner that do not reflect our view or are inconsistent with our own business practice and fraudulent or other illegal activity using our payment product if we are unable to maintain our reputation or if event occur that damage our reputation the value of our brand may be impaired which could harm our relationship with client customer and the public well impact our business global economic political market and social event or condition may harm our business our revenue are dependent on the volume and number of payment transaction made by customer government and business whose spending pattern may be affected by prevailing economic condition in addition almost half of our operating revenue are earned outside the international transaction revenue represent significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy therefore adverse macroeconomic condition including recession inflation high unemployment currency fluctuation actual or anticipated large scale default or failure or slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer government and corporate spending which have direct impact on our revenue in addition outbreak of illness pandemic or other local or global health issue like the zika virus political uncertainty like brexit international hostility armed conflict or unrest and natural disaster could impact our operation our client and our activity in particular location these event could also reduce cross border travel and spend which impact our international transaction revenue which are generated by processing cross border payment and cash volume transaction well from foreign currency exchange transaction any of contentssuch decline in cross border activity could impact the number of cross border transaction we process and our foreign currency exchange activity and in turn reduce our revenue decline in economic condition could impact our client well and their decision to reduce the number of card account and credit line of their account holder which ultimately impact our revenue they may also implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate marketing budget and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added service from any event or condition that impair the functioning of the financial market tighten the credit market or lead to downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing cost and impair our ability to access the capital and credit market on favorable term which could affect our liquidity and capital resource or significantly increase our cost of capital if client default on their settlement obligation it may also impact our liquidity any of these event could adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue our indemnification obligation to fund settlement loss of our client expose to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to honor it settlement obligation in accordance with the visa rule in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement our indemnification exposure is generally limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client several of our smaller client or systemic operational failure lasting more than single day could cause to exceed our available financial resource which could negatively impact our financial position even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss and harm our business see note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the united kingdom proposed withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial result in june referendum wa held in the united kingdom to determine whether the country should remain member of the with voter approving withdrawal from the commonly referred to brexit the government is working towards triggering article of the lisbon treaty which will commence the official withdrawal process uncertainty over the term of the departure from the could harm our business and financial result in addition other member country may consider referendum regarding their membership any of these event along with any political change that may occur result of brexit could cause political and economic uncertainty in europe result our operation in the resulting from the recent acquisition of visa europe well our global operation could be impacted the announcement of brexit caused significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuation that resulted in the strengthening of the dollar the strengthening of the dollar relative to the british pound and other currency may harm our result of operation the local currency result of our international operation may translate into fewer dollar uncertainty over brexit and currency fluctuation could also impact our client who may curtail or postpone investment in growing their credit portfolio limit credit line modify fee and loyalty program or take other action that harm our volume and revenue in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national law and regulation in the and we well our client who have significant operation in the may incur additional cost and expense we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory framework from the rest of the and result our visa rule and contractual commitment in the may be impacted in addition because we conduct business in and have operation in the we may need to apply for regulatory authorization and permission in separate member state these factor may impact our ability to operate in the and seamlessly any of these effect of brexit among others could harm our business and financial result technology and information security risksfailure to anticipate adapt to or keep pace with new technology in the payment industry could harm our business and impact our future growth of contentsthe global payment industry is undergoing significant and rapid technological change including mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance technology ecommerce tokenization crypto currency distributed ledger and blockchain technology and result we expect new service and technology to continue to emerge and evolve in addition to our own initiative and innovation we work closely with third party including some potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology it is difficult however to predict which technological development or innovation will become widely adopted it is also difficult to predict how these technology may be regulated moreover some of these new technology could be subject to intellectual property related lawsuit or assertion potentially impacting our development effort and or requiring to obtain license if we or our partner fail to adapt or keep pace with new technology in the payment space in timely manner it could harm our ability to compete decrease the value of our product and service to our client impact our intellectual property or licensing right and harm our business and impact our future growth failure in or breach of our network or system including result of cyber attack could harm our business our information security and processing system well those of our client merchant and other third party service provider may experience damage or disruption from number of cause including power outage computer and telecommunication failure computer virus worm or other destructive software internal design manual or usage error cyber attack terrorism workplace violence or wrongdoing catastrophic event natural disaster and severe weather condition our visibility and role in the global payment industry may also put at greater risk of being targeted by hacker in the normal course of our business we have been the target of malicious cyber attack attempt additionally several merchant have encountered substantial cybersecurity breach and breach affecting their customer some of were visa account holder although these merchant breach have not had direct material impact on we believe these incident are likely to continue and we may be unable to predict the direct or indirect impact of these future attack to our business we may also be impacted by breach of our financial institution client and third party processor that affect the broader payment system in addition numerous and evolving information security threat including advanced and persistent cyber attack particularly on our internet facing and reliant application could compromise the confidentiality availability and integrity of our data the security measure and procedure we our client merchant and other service provider have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breach cyber attack or system failure although we devote significant resource to our information security program and have implemented security measure to protect our system and data there can be no assurance that our effort will prevent these known or unknown threat if we are sued in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice any of which could harm our business in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach cyber attack or system failure at one or more of our client merchant or other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our product which could harm our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally breach may also subject visa to additional regulation or governmental or regulatory investigation which could result in significant compliance cost fine or enforcement action or potential restriction imposed by regulator on our ability to process transaction we may experience error interruption delay or cessation of service in our information technology infrastructure and processing system which could significantly disrupt our operation impact our client and customer damage our reputation result in litigation violation of applicable privacy and other law and regulatory fine or penalty decrease the overall use and acceptance of our product and be costly time consuming and difficult to remedy in the event of damage or disruption to our business due to these occurrence we may not be able to successfully and quickly recover all of our critical business function asset and data through our current business continuity program furthermore while we maintain insurance our coverage may not sufficiently cover all type of loss or claim that may arise structural and organizational risksfailure to maintain interoperability with visa europe system during the integration phase of our acquisition could damage the business and global perception of our brand of contentswhile visa europe system are being integrated with our legacy system we and visa europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement system result we have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction involving both of our territory regardless of where it originates visa europe independent system operation could present challenge to our business in the event of increasing cost or difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective system during the integration phase the separation of payment card scheme and processing may also exacerbate this risk any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product between visa europe and our legacy operation could negatively affect the experience of customer using visa product globally failure to authorize clear and settle inter territory transaction quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brand we may not achieve the anticipated benefit of the visa europe acquisition or those of our other strategic investment or acquisition and may face other risk and uncertainty result in june we acquired of the share capital of visa europe we believe the acquisition position to create additional value through increased scale efficiency realized by the integration of both business and benefit related to visa europe transition from an association to for profit enterprise although there can be no guarantee that we will realize these benefit in addition we may make other strategic investment or acquisition which like the visa europe acquisition are inherently risky and subject to many factor outside our control the visa europe acquisition involves and any future strategic endeavor may involve significant risk and uncertainty which could include disruption to our ongoing business including diversion of resource and management attention from our existing business greater than expected investment of resource or operating expense failure to develop the acquired business adequately difficulty implementing control procedure and policy at the acquired company challenge of integrating new employee business culture business system and technology failure to retain employee client or partner of the acquired business in the case of foreign acquisition such the acquisition of visa europe risk related to the integration of operation across different culture and language and the economic political and regulatory risk associated with operating in new region or country for more information on regulatory risk please see item business government regulation and item risk factor regulatory risk above discovery of unidentified issue after the acquisition or investment wa made failure to mitigate the liability of the acquired business for example while we have attempted to mitigate the risk of loss associated with certain visa europe litigation through the issuance of the preferred stock there can be no guarantee that the liability associated with that litigation will not exceed the value of such preferred stock dilutive issuance of equity security if new security are issued potential incurrence of debt including the substantial amount of debt incurred in connection with the visa europe acquisition negative impact on our financial position and or statement of operation and anticipated benefit or value of the investment or acquisition not materializing we may be unable to attract hire and retain highly qualified and diverse workforce including key management of contentsthe talent and effort of our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success our management team ha significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term that are competitive with the rest of the labor market failure to attract hire develop motivate and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent or failure to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operation and adversely affect our business and our future success the conversion of our class and class common stock or series and series preferred stock into share of class common stock would result in voting dilution to and could impact the market price of our existing class common stock the market price of our class common stock could fall result of many factor under our retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our covered litigation all class common stock will become convertible into class common stock in connection with the acquisition of visa europe we issued series and series preferred stock which will become convertible into class common stock in stage based on development in current and potential litigation and will become fully convertible no later than subject to holdback to cover any pending claim conversion of our class and class common stock into class common stock or our series and series preferred stock into class common stock would increase the amount of class common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price of our existing class common stock and would dilute the voting power of existing class common stockholder holder of our class and common stock and series and series preferred stock may have different interest than our class common stockholder concerning certain significant transaction although their voting right are limited holder of our class and common stock and in certain specified circumstance holder of our series and series preferred stock can vote on certain significant transaction with respect to our class and common stock these transaction include proposed consolidation or merger decision to exit our core payment business and any other vote required under delaware law with respect to our series and series preferred stock voting right are limited to proposed consolidation or merger in which holder of the series and series preferred stock would either receive share of stock or other equity security with preference right and privilege that are not substantially identical to the preference right and privilege of the applicable series of preferred stock or ii receive security cash or other property that is different from what our class common stockholder would receive because the holder of class of capital stock other than class common stock are our current and former financial institution client they may have interest that diverge from our class common stockholder result the holder of these class of capital stock may not have the same incentive to approve corporate action that may be favorable to the holder of class common stock and their interest may otherwise conflict with interest of our class common stockholder delaware law provision in our certificate of incorporation and bylaw and our capital structure could make merger takeover attempt or change in control difficult provision contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaw and our capital structure could delay or prevent merger takeover attempt or change in control that our stockholder may consider favorable for example except for limited exception no person may beneficially own more than of our class common stock or of our total outstanding common stock on an converted basis unless our board of director approves the acquisition of such share in advance no competitor or an affiliate of competitor may hold more than of our total outstanding common stock on an converted basis the affirmative vote of the class and

transaction at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policy and procedure to manage settlement risk which may require client to post collateral if certain credit standard are not met see note summary of significant accounting policy and note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangement with financial institution and other client and partner under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain type of loss incurred relating to the service we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement contractual obligation our contractual commitment will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligation identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transaction that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligation of september we believe that we will be able to fund these obligation through cash generated from our operation and available credit facility of content payment due by period le year more year total in million long term debt order incentive and sponsorship purchase consideration in december we issued billion of fixed rate senior note in conjunction with the acquisition of visa europe with maturity ranging between and year interest on the note at rate ranging between and is payable semi annually on june and december of each year amount presented include payment for both interest and principal also see note debt to our consolidated financial statement represents agreement to purchase good and service that specify significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction includes operating lease for premise equipment and software license which range in term from le than one year to nineteen year represents future cash payment for long term contract with financial institution client and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these agreement which range in term from one to sixteen year can provide card issuance and or conversion support volume growth target and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirement payment under these agreement will generally be offset by revenue earned from higher corresponding payment and transaction volume these payment amount are estimate and will change based on client performance amendment to existing contract or execution of new contract related amount disclosed in note commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreement that we estimate we will record visa is party to contractual sponsorship agreement ranging from approximately three to sixteen year these contract are designed to increase visa brand recognition drive visa product usage and differentiate visa against competition over the life of these contract visa is required to make payment in exchange for certain advertising and promotional right in connection with these contractual commitment visa ha an obligation to spend certain minimum amount for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract for obligation where the individual year of spend are not specified in the contract we have estimated the timing of when these amount will be spent includes expected dividend amount of million dividend were declared in october and will be paid on december to all holder of record of visa common stock of november on june we acquired of the share capital of visa europe in connection with the purchase we will pay an additional billion plus compound annual interest on the third anniversary of the closing see note acquisition of visa europe to our consolidated financial statement we have liability for uncertain tax position of million at september we had also accrued million of interest and million of penalty associated with our uncertain tax position we can not determine the range of cash payment that will be made and the timing of the cash settlement if any associated with our uncertain tax position therefore no amount related to these obligation have been included in the table we evaluate the need to make contribution to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence expected contribution to our pension plan have not been included in the table such amount are dependent upon the consideration discussed above and may result in wide range of amount see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement and the liquidity and capital resource section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation of contentscritical accounting estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america which require to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported see note summary of significant accounting policy to our consolidated financial statement we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition client incentive critical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with financial institution client merchant and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these incentive are primarily accounted for reduction to operating revenue however if separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for operating expense we generally capitalize advance incentive payment under these agreement if select criterion are met the capitalization criterion include the existence of future economic benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language early termination clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amount deferred capitalized amount are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentive not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance these accrual are regularly reviewed and estimate of performance are adjusted appropriate based on change in performance expectation actual client performance amendment to existing contract or the execution of new contract assumption and judgment estimation of client incentive relies on forecast of payment volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client merchant and business partner impact if actual result differ from assumption if actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate client incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september client incentive represented of gross operating revenue legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate our retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal our europe of contentsretrospective responsibility plan only cover visa europe territory covered litigation and resultant liability and loss relating to the covered period subject to certain limitation see note and europe retrospective responsibility plan and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement impact if actual result differ from assumption due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement income tax critical estimate in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgment regarding certain tax position including the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction assumption and judgment we have various tax filing position with regard to the timing and amount of deduction and credit the establishment of liability for uncertain tax position and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by the taxing authority if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse change in market factor our exposure to financial market risk result primarily from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price aggregate risk exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are exposed to adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation are primarily related to adverse change in the functional currency value of revenue generated from foreign currency denominated transaction and adverse change in the functional currency value of payment in foreign currency we manage these risk by entering into foreign currency forward contract that hedge exposure of the variability in the functional currency equivalent of anticipated non functional currency denominated cash flow our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but doe not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contract not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were billion and billion at september and respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below predetermined and approved threshold however actual result could materially differ from our forecast the effect of hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the functional currency is estimated to create an additional fair value gain of approximately million or loss of approximately million respectively on our foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september see note summary of significant accounting policy and note derivative and non derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement on june we acquired of the share capital of visa europe on the third anniversary of the

balance sheet see note summary of significant accounting policy and note derivative and non derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement we are also subject to foreign

rate riskour investment portfolio asset are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate security these asset are included in cash equivalent and short term or long term available for sale investment investment in fixed rate instrument carry degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate security may be adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate additionally falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because security mature the proceeds are reinvested at lower rate generating le interest income historically we have been able to hold investment until maturity neither our operating result or cash flow have been are they expected to be materially impacted by sudden change in market interest rate the fair value balance of our fixed rate investment security at

benefit pension plan asset were billion and billion respectively and projected benefit obligation were billion and billion respectively material adverse decline in the value of pension plan asset and or the discount rate for benefit obligation would result in decrease in the funded status of the pension plan an increase in pension cost and an increase in required funding hypothetical decrease in
