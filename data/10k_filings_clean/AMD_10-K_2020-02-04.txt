distributor and mid sized and smaller oems and odms typically distributor handle wide variety of product and may include those that compete with our product distributor typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product price reduction and provide return right with respect to any product that we have removed from our price book that is not more than month older than the manufacturing code date in addition some agreement with our distributor may contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return add in board aib manufacturer and system integratorswe offer component level graphic and chipset product to aib manufacturer who in turn build and sell board level product using our technology to system integrator si retail buyer and sub distributor our agreement with aibs protect their inventory of our product against price reduction we also sell directly to our si customer si typically sell from position of regional or product based strength in the market they usually operate on short design cycle and can respond quickly with new technology si often use discrete graphic solution mean to differentiate their product and add value to their customer in the microprocessor and chipset marketintel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively to target our customer and our channel partner with special incentive and to influence customer who do business with these aggressive activity have in the past resulted in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for many of our product and adversely affected our margin and profitability intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturer and their channel of distribution through various brand and other marketing program result of intel position in the microprocessor market intel ha been able to control microprocessor and computer system standard and benchmark and to dictate the type of product the microprocessor market requires of intel also dominates the computer system platform which includes core logic chipsets graphic chip networking device wired and wireless non volatile storage and other component necessary to assemble computer system oems that purchase microprocessor for computer system are highly dependent on intel which can make them le innovative on their own and to large extent can become distributor of intel technology additionally intel is able to drive de facto standard and specification for microprocessor that could cause and other company to have delayed access to such standard long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy and pricing action which may limit our market share and margin product mix and introduction schedule product bundling marketing and merchandising strategy exclusivity payment to it current and potential customer retailer and channel partner that require or result in exclusive product arrangement de facto control over industry standard and heavy influence on pc manufacturer and other pc industry participant including motherboard memory chipset and basic input output system bios supplier and software company well the graphic interface for intel platform and marketing and advertising expenditure in support of positioning the intel brand over the brand of it oem customer and retailer intel ha substantially greater financial resource than we do and accordingly spends substantially greater amount on marketing and research and development than we do we expect intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company intel could take action that place our discrete gpus at competitive disadvantage including giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel ha announced that it is developing their own high end discrete gpus intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on other competitor include variety of company providing or developing arm based design at relatively low cost and low power processor for the computing market including tablet and thin client form factor well dense server set top box and gaming console arm holding design and license it arm core and architecture to third party including and offer supporting software and service our ability to compete with company who use arm based solution depends on our ability to timely design and bring to market energy efficient high performing product at an attractive price point competition in the graphic marketsin the graphic market our competitor include supplier of discrete graphic embedded graphic processor and integrated graphic processor igp chipsets intel manufacture and sell embedded graphic processor and igp chipsets and is dominant competitor with respect to this portion of our business higher unit shipment of our apus and intel integrated graphic may drive computer manufacturer to reduce the number of system they build paired with discrete graphic component particularly for notebook because they may offer satisfactory graphic performance for most mainstream pc user at lower cost intel could take action that place our discrete gpus and igp chipsets at competitive disadvantage such giving one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel is developing it own high end discrete gpus for both consumer and commercial application our principal competitor in the discrete graphic market is nvidia and they are considered the market share leader other competitor include number of smaller company which may have greater flexibility to address specific market need but le financial resource to do so especially we believe that the growing complexity of graphic processor and the associated research and development cost represent an increasingly higher barrier to entry in this market the data center our principal competitor is nvidia the adoption of their proprietary cuda software platform established their market share in high performance computing and machine learning other competitor include numerous deep learning accelerator company consisting mostly of early to late stage start ups we are the market share leader in semi custom game console product where graphic performance is critical and where we compete primarily against nvidia competition in the server marketsin the server market we compete against intel with our cpu server product and nvidia with our gpu server product research and developmentwe focus our research and development activity on improving product performance and enhancing product design our main area of focus is on delivering the next generation of cpu and gpu ip and designing that ip into our socs for our next generation of product with in each case improved system performance and performance per watt characteristic for example we are focusing on improving the battery life of our apu product for notebook and the performance and power efficiency of our discrete gpus and our microprocessor for server we are also focusing on delivering range of low power integrated platform to serve key market including commercial client mobile computing and gaming we believe that these platform will bring customer increased performance and energy efficiency we also work with industry leader on process technology software and other functional intellectual property and with others in the industry and industry consortium to conduct early stage research and development we conduct product and system research and development activity for our product in the united state with additional design and development engineering team located in canada china india taiwan and singapore who undertake specific activity at the direction of our headquarters manufacturing arrangement and assembly and test facilitiesthird party wafer foundry facilitiesglobalfoundries inc we are party to wafer supply agreement wsa with globalfoundries inc gf which governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product from gf manufactured at process node larger than nm with limited exception gf wa related party to may taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company we also have foundry arrangement with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc for the production of wafer for certain product other third party manufacturer we outsource board level graphic product manufacturing to third party manufacturer assembly test mark and packaging

product we are party to two assembly test mark and pack atmp joint venture collectively the atmp jv with tongfu microelectronics co ltd the majority of our atmp service are provided by the atmp jv intellectual property and licensing we rely on contract and intellectual property right to protect our product and technology from unauthorized third party copying and use intellectual property right include copyright patent patent application trademark trade secret and mask work right of december we approximately patent in the united state and approximately patent application pending in the united state in certain case we have filed corresponding application in foreign jurisdiction including united state and foreign matter we have approximately patent matter worldwide consisting of approximately issued patent and patent application pending we expect to file future patent application in both the united state and abroad on significant invention we deem appropriate we do not believe that any individual patent or the expiration of any patent is or would be material to our business is typical in the semiconductor industry we have numerous cross licensing and technology exchange agreement with other company under which we both transfer and receive technology and intellectual property right one such agreement is the cross license agreement that we entered into with intel on november under the cross license we granted to intel and intel granted to non exclusive royalty free license to all of each other patent that first filed no later than november and each party can exploit these patent anywhere in the world for making and selling certain semiconductor and electronic related product under the cross license agreement intel ha right to make semiconductor product for third party but the third party product design are not licensed result of such manufacture we have right to perform assembly and testing for third party but not right to make semiconductor product for third party the term of the cross license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the licensed patent unless earlier terminated party can terminate the cross license agreement or the right and license of the other party if the other party materially breach the cross license agreement and doe not correct the noticed material breach within day upon such termination the terminated party license right terminate but the terminating party license right continue subject to that party continued compliance with the term of the cross license agreement the cross license agreement will automatically terminate if party undergoes change of control defined in the cross license agreement and both party license will terminate upon the bankruptcy of party that party may assume but may not assign the cross license agreement and in the event that the cross license agreement can not be assumed the cross license agreement and the license granted will terminate backlogsales are made primarily pursuant to purchase order for current delivery or agreement covering purchase over period of time some of these order or agreement may be revised or canceled without penalty generally in light of current industry practice we do not believe that such order or agreement provide meaningful backlog figure or are necessarily indicative of actual sale for any succeeding period with respect to our semi custom soc product our order and agreement are more stringent resulting in meaningful backlog for the coming quarter seasonalityour operating result tend to vary seasonally historically our net revenue ha been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year although market condition and product transition could impact these trend employee of december we had approximately employee environmental regulation our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit if our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction we could also be held liable for any and all consequence arising of exposure to hazardous material used stored released disposed of by or located at under or emanating from our facility or other environmental or natural resource damage while we have budgeted for foreseeable associated expenditure we can not assure you that future environmental legal requirement will not become more stringent or costly in the future therefore we can not assure you that our cost of complying with current and future environmental and health and safety law and our liability arising from past and future release of or exposure to hazardous substance will not have material adverse effect on environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect environmental law including the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we are named responsible party on superfund clean up order for three site in sunnyvale california that are on the national priority list since we have discovered hazardous material release to the groundwater from former underground tank and proceeded to investigate and conduct remediation at these three site the chemical released into the groundwater were commonly used in the semiconductor industry in the united state in the wafer fabrication process prior to in we received final site clean up requirement order from the california regional water quality control board relating to the three site we have entered into settlement agreement with other responsible party on two of the order during the term of such agreement other party have agreed to assume most of the foreseeable cost well the primary role in conducting remediation activity under the order we remain responsible for additional cost beyond the scope of the agreement well all remaining cost in the event that the other party do not fulfill their obligation under the settlement agreement to address anticipated future remediation cost under the order we have computed and recorded an estimated environmental liability of approximately million and have not recorded any potential insurance recovery in determining the estimated cost of the cleanup cost could also increase result of additional test and remediation obligation imposed by the environmental protection agency or california regional water quality control board the progress of future remediation effort can not be predicted with certainty and these cost may change we believe that the potential liability if any in excess of amount already accrued will not have material adverse effect on our financial condition cash flow or result of operation risk factorsthe risk and uncertainty described below are not the only one we face if any of the following risk actually occurs our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially adversely affected in addition you should consider the interrelationship and compounding effect of two or more risk occurring simultaneously intel corporation dominance of the microprocessor market and it aggressive business practice may limit our ability to compete effectively intel corporation ha been the market share leader for microprocessor for many year intel market share margin and significant financial resource enable it to market it product aggressively

we do we expect intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing research and development new manufacturing facility and other technology company to the extent intel manufacture significantly larger portion of it microprocessor product using more advanced process technology or introduces competitive new product into the market we do we may be more vulnerable to intel aggressive marketing and pricing strategy for microprocessor product long intel remains in this dominant position we may be materially adversely affected by intel business practice including rebating and allocation strategy

one or more of our competitor in the graphic market such nvidia corporation preferential access to it proprietary graphic interface or other useful information also intel ha announced that it is developing their own high end discrete gpus intel position in the microprocessor market and integrated graphic chipset market it introduction of competitive new product it existing relationship with top tier oems and it aggressive marketing and pricing strategy could result in lower unit sale and lower average selling price for our product which could have material adverse effect on we rely on third party to manufacture our product and if they are unable to do so on timely basis in sufficient quantity and using competitive technology our business could be materially adversely affected we rely on third party wafer foundry to fabricate the silicon wafer for all of our product we also rely on third party manufacturer to assemble test mark and pack atmp our product it is important to have reliable relationship with all of these third party manufacturing supplier to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand we can not guarantee that these manufacturer or our other third party manufacturing supplier will be able to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirement if we experience supply constraint from our third party manufacturing supplier we may be required to allocate the affected product amongst our customer which could have material adverse effect on our relationship with these customer and on our financial condition in addition if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from our manufacturing supplier it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business we do not have long term commitment contract with some of our third party manufacturing supplier we obtain some of these manufacturing service on purchase order basis and these manufacturer are not required to provide with any specified minimum quantity of product beyond the quantity in an existing purchase order accordingly we depend on these supplier to to portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our need to produce product of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yield and to deliver those product to on timely basis and at acceptable price the manufacturer we use also fabricate wafer and atmp product for other company including certain of our competitor they could choose to prioritize capacity for other customer increase the price that they charge on short notice or reduce or eliminate delivery to which could have material adverse effect on our business other risk associated with our dependence on third party manufacturer include limited control over delivery schedule and quality assurance lack of capacity in period of excess demand misappropriation of our intellectual property dependence on several small undercapitalized subcontractor and limited ability to manage inventory and part moreover if any of our third party manufacturer suffer any damage to facility lose benefit under material agreement experience power outage lack sufficient capacity to manufacture our product encounter financial difficulty are unable to secure necessary raw material from their supplier or suffer any other disruption or reduction in efficiency we may encounter supply delay or disruption if we are unable to secure sufficient or reliable supply of product our ability to meet customer demand may be adversely affected and this could materially affect our business if we transition the production of some of our product to new manufacturer we may experience delayed product introduction lower yield or poorer performance of our product if we experience problem with product quality or are unable to secure sufficient capacity from particular third party manufacturer or if we for other reason cease utilizing one of those supplier we may be unable to secure an alternative supply for any specific product in short time frame we could experience significant delay in the shipment of our product if we are required to find alternative third party manufacturer which could have material adverse effect on our business we are party to two atmp joint venture collectively the atmp jv with tongfu microelectronics co ltd the majority of our atmp service are provided by the jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the atmp jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business failure to achieve expected manufacturing yield for our product could negatively impact our financial result semiconductor manufacturing yield are result of both product design and process technology which is typically proprietary to the manufacturer and low yield can result from design failure process technology failure or combination of both our third party foundry are responsible for the process technology used to fabricate silicon wafer if our third party foundry experience manufacturing inefficiency or encounter disruption error or difficulty during production we may fail to achieve acceptable yield or experience product delivery delay we can not be certain that our third party foundry will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technology needed to manufacture future generation of our product profitably or on timely basis or that our competitor will not develop new technology product or process earlier moreover during period when foundry are implementing new process technology their manufacturing facility may not be fully productive substantial delay in the technology transition to smaller process technology could have material adverse effect on particularly if our competitor transition to more cost effective technology before for example we are presently focusing our nanometer nm product portfolio on taiwan semiconductor co ltd tsmc process if tsmc is not able to manufacture our product in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand it could have material adverse effect on our business any decrease in manufacturing yield could result in an increase in per unit cost which would adversely impact our gross margin and or force to allocate our reduced product supply amongst our customer which could harm our relationship and reputation with our customer and materially adversely affect our business the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce product on timely basis with feature and performance level that provide value to our customer while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transition our success depends to significant extent on the development qualification implementation and acceptance of new product design and improvement that provide value to our customer our ability to develop qualify and distribute and have manufactured new product and related technology to meet evolving industry requirement at price acceptable to our customer and on timely basis are significant factor in determining our competitiveness in our target market consumer have new product feature preference or have different requirement than those consumer in the pc market pc sale could be negatively impacted which could adversely impact our business our product roadmap includes our next generation amd ryzen amd radeon and amd epyc processor using process technology we can not assure you that our effort to execute our product roadmap will result in innovative product and technology that provide value to our customer if we fail to or are delayed in developing qualifying or shipping new product or technology that provide value to our customer and address these new trend or if we fail to predict which new form factor consumer will adopt and adjust our business accordingly we may lose competitive positioning which could cause to lose market share and require to discount the selling price of our although we make substantial investment in research and development we can not be certain that we will be able to develop obtain or successfully implement new product and technology on timely basis or that they will be well received by our customer moreover our investment in new product and technology involve certain risk and uncertainty and could disrupt our ongoing business new investment may not generate sufficient revenue may incur unanticipated liability and may divert our limited resource and distract management from our current operation we can not be certain that our ongoing investment in new product and technology will be successful will meet our expectation and will not adversely affect our reputation financial condition and operating result delay in developing qualifying or shipping new product can also cause to miss our customer product design window or in some case breach contractual obligation or cause to pay penalty if our customer do not include our product in the initial design of their computer system or product they will typically not use our product in their system or product until at least the next design configuration the process of being qualified for inclusion in customer system or product can be lengthy and could cause to further miss cycle in the demand of end user which also could result in loss of market share and harm our business we also depend on the success and timing of our customer platform launch if our customer delay their product launch or if our customer do not effectively market their platform with our product it could result in delay in bringing our product to market and cause to miss cycle in the demand of end user which could materially adversely affect our business in addition market demand requires that product incorporate new feature and performance standard on an industry wide basis over the life of specific product the sale price is typically reduced over time the introduction of new product and enhancement to existing product is necessary to maintain the overall corporate average selling price if we are unable to introduce new product with sufficiently high sale price or to increase unit sale volume capable of offsetting the reduction in the sale price of existing product over time our business could be materially adversely affected if we can not generate sufficient revenue and operating cash flow or obtain external financing we may face cash shortfall and be unable to make all of our planned investment in research and development or other strategic investment our ability to fund research and development expenditure depends on generating sufficient revenue and cash flow from operation and the availability of external financing if necessary our research and development expenditure together with ongoing operating expense will be substantial drain on our cash flow and may decrease our cash balance if new competitor technological advance by existing competitor or other competitive factor require to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in our research and development effort our operating expense would increase if we are required to invest significantly greater resource than anticipated in research and development effort without an increase in revenue our operating result could decline we regularly ass market for external financing opportunity including debt and equity financing additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or if available may not be available on satisfactory term the health of the credit market may adversely impact our ability to obtain financing when needed any downgrade from credit rating agency such moody or standard poor may adversely impact our ability to obtain external financing or the term of such financing credit agency downgrade or concern regarding our credit worthiness may impact relationship with our supplier who may limit our credit line our inability to obtain needed financing or to generate sufficient cash from operation may require to abandon project or curtail planned investment in research and development or other strategic initiative if we curtail planned investment in research and development or abandon project our product may fail to remain competitive and our business would be materially adversely affected the loss of significant customer may have material adverse effect on we depend on small number of customer for substantial portion of our business and we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for significant part of our revenue in the future if one of our key customer decides to stop buying our product or if one of these customer materially reduces it operation or it demand for our product our business would be materially adversely affected our receipt of revenue from our semi custom soc product is dependent upon our technology being designed into third party product and the success of those product the revenue that we receive from our semi custom soc product is in the form of non recurring engineering fee charged to third party for design and development service and revenue received in connection with sale of our semi custom soc product to these third party result our ability to generate revenue from our semi custom product depends on our ability to secure customer for our semi custom design pipeline our customer desire to pursue the project and our semi custom soc product being incorporated into those customer product any revenue from sale of our semi custom soc product is directly related to sale of the third party product and reflective of their success in the market moreover we have no control over the marketing effort of these third party and we can not make any assurance that sale of their product will be successful in current or future year consequently the semi custom soc product revenue expected by may not be fully realized and our result may be adversely affected global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating result uncertain global economic condition have in the past and may in the future adversely impact our business including without limitation slowdown in the chinese economy one of the largest global market for desktop and notebook pc uncertainty in the worldwide economic environment may negatively impact consumer confidence and spending causing our customer to postpone purchase in addition during challenging economic time our current or potential future customer may experience cash flow problem and result may modify delay or cancel plan to purchase our product additionally if our customer are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or are unable to secure financing they may not be able to pay or may delay payment of account receivable that they owe the risk related to our customer potentially defaulting on or delaying payment to is increased because we expect that small number of customer will continue to account for substantial part of our revenue any inability of our current or potential future customer to pay for our product may adversely affect our earnings and cash flow moreover our key supplier may reduce their output or become insolvent thereby adversely impacting our ability to manufacture our product in addition uncertain economic condition may make it more difficult for to raise fund through borrowing or private or public sale of debt or equity security our worldwide operation are subject to political legal and economic risk and natural disaster which could have material adverse effect on we maintain operation around the world including in the united state canada europe australia and asia we rely on third party wafer foundry in the united state europe and asia nearly all product assembly and final testing of our product is performed at manufacturing facility operated by third party manufacturing facility in china malaysia and taiwan we also have international sale operation international sale percent of net revenue were for the year ended december we expect that international sale will continue to be significant portion of total sale in the foreseeable future the political legal and economic risk associated with our operation in foreign country include without limitation expropriation change in specific country or region political or economic condition change in tax law trade protection measure and import or export licensing requirement difficulty in protecting our intellectual property difficulty in managing staffing and exposure to different employment practice and labor law change in foreign currency exchange rate restriction on transfer of fund and other asset of our subsidiary between jurisdiction change in freight and interest rate disruption in air transportation between the united state and our overseas facility loss or modification of exemption for tax and tariff and compliance with law and regulation related to international operation including export control and economic sanction law and regulation and the foreign corrupt practice act in addition our worldwide operation or those of our business partner could be subject to natural disaster such earthquake tsunami flooding typhoon and volcanic eruption that disrupt manufacturing or other operation for example our santa clara operation are located near major earthquake fault line in california there may be conflict or uncertainty in the country in which we operate including public health issue for example an outbreak of contagious disease such novel coronavirus ncov avian influenza measles or ebola safety issue natural disaster fire disruption of service from utility nuclear power plant accident or general economic or political factor for example the united kingdom referendum commonly referred to brexit ha created economic and political uncertainty in the european union also the european union general data protection regulation imposes significant new requirement on how we collect process and transfer personal data well significant fine for non compliance any of the risk should they occur could result in an increase in the cost of component production delay general business interruption delay from difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology tariff and other barrier and restriction longer payment cycle increased tax restriction on the repatriation of fund and the burden of complying with variety of foreign law any of which could ultimately have material adverse effect on our business government action and regulation such export administration regulation tariff and trade protection measure may limit our ability to export our product to certain customer we have joint venture with higon information technology co ltd thatic comprised of two separate legal entity china and china collectively the thatic jv in june the united state commerce department bureau of industry and security bi added certain chinese entity to the entity list including thatic and the thatic jv in october the bi added additional chinese entity to the entity list also the united state administration ha called for change to domestic and foreign policy specifically united state china trade relation remain uncertain the united state administration ha announced tariff on certain product imported into the united state with china the country of origin and china ha imposed tariff in response to the action of the united state we are taking step to mitigate the impact of these tariff on our business and amd processor based product there is also possibility of future tariff trade protection measure import or export regulation or other restriction imposed on our product or on our customer by the united state china or other that could have material adverse effect on our business significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any tariff trade protection measure or restriction could result in lost sale adversely impacting our reputation and business our product may be subject to security vulnerability that could have material adverse effect on the product that we sell are complex and may be subject to security vulnerability that could result in among other thing the loss corruption theft or misuse of confidential data or system performance issue our effort to prevent and address security vulnerability may decrease performance be only partially effective or not successful at all we may also depend on third party such customer vendor and end user to deploy our mitigation or create their own and they may delay decline or modify the implementation of such mitigation our relationship with our customer could be adversely affected some of our customer may stop purchasing our product reduce or delay future purchase of our product or use competing product any of these action by our customer could adversely affect our revenue we also are subject to claim and litigation related to spectre side channel exploit and may face additional claim or litigation for future vulnerability actual or perceived security vulnerability of our product may subject to adverse publicity damage to our brand and reputation and could materially harm our business or financial result it outage data loss data breach and cyber attack could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business reputation and operation in the ordinary course of our business we maintain sensitive data on our information technology it asset and also may maintain sensitive information on our business partner and third party provider it asset including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information relating to our business and that of our customer and business partner maintaining the security of this information is important to our business and reputation we believe that company have been increasingly subject to wide variety of security incident cyber attack hacking and phishing attack business and system disruption attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access these threat can come from variety of source all ranging in sophistication from an individual hacker or insider threat to state sponsored attack cyber threat may be generic or they may be custom crafted against our information system cyber attack have become increasingly more prevalent and much harder to detect defend against or prevent our network and storage application well those of our customer business partner and third party provider may be subject to unauthorized access by hacker or breached due to operator error malfeasance or other system disruption it is often difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incident and the damage caused by such incident these data breach and any unauthorized access misuse or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose sensitive business information cyber attack on or our customer business partner or third party provider could also cause to incur significant remediation cost result in product development delay disrupt key business operation and divert attention of management and key information technology resource these incident could also subject to liability expose to significant expense and cause significant harm to our reputation and business we also maintain confidential and personally identifiable information about our worker the confidentiality and integrity of our worker and consumer data is important to our business and our worker and consumer have high expectation that we adequately protect their personal information we anticipate ongoing and increasing cost related to enhancing and implementing information security control including cost related to upgrading application computer and network security component training worker to maintain and monitor our security control remediating any data security breach and addressing the related litigation mitigating reputational harm and compliance with external regulation such the european union general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act we often partner with third party provider for certain worker service and we may provide certain limited worker information to such third party based on the scope of the service provided to however if these third party fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our worker data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operation failure to adequately maintain and update our security system could materially adversely affect our operation and our ability to maintain worker confidence failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information it outage data loss and data breach could materially adversely affect our financial condition our competitive position and operating result have wafer supply agreement with globalfoundries inc gf with obligation to purchase all of our microprocessor and accelerated processing unit apu product requirement and certain portion of our graphic processing unit gpu product requirement manufactured at process node larger than nanometer from gf with limited exception if gf is not able to satisfy our manufacturing requirement our business could be adversely impacted the wafer supply agreement wsa governs the term by which we purchase product manufactured by gf and is in place until pursuant to the wsa we are required to purchase all of our microprocessor and apu product requirement and certain portion of our gpu product requirement from gf manufactured at process node larger than nanometer nm with limited exception if gf is unable to achieve anticipated manufacturing yield manufacture our product on timely basis at competitive price or meet our capacity requirement we may experience supply shortage for certain product or increased cost and our business could be materially adversely affected under the term of the wsa we have agreed to minimum annual wafer purchase target through if we fail to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during calendar year we will be required to pay to gf portion of the difference between our actual wafer purchase and the applicable annual purchase target if our actual wafer requirement are le than the number of wafer required to meet the applicable annual wafer purchase target we could have excess inventory or higher inventory unit cost both of which may adversely impact our gross margin and our result of operation in addition gf ha relied on mubadala technology investment llc mubadala tech for it funding need if mubadala tech fails to adequately fund gf on timely basis or at all and if gf is not otherwise able to adequately fund it operation gf ability to manufacture product for could be materially adversely affected uncertainty involving the ordering and shipment of our product could materially adversely affect we typically sell our product pursuant to individual purchase order we generally do not have long term supply arrangement with our customer or minimum purchase requirement except that order generally must be for standard pack quantity generally our customer may cancel order for standard product more than day prior to shipment without incurring significant fee we base our inventory level in part on customer estimate of demand for their product which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our product that our customer will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our product are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributor and customer our forecast for demand are then based on estimate provided by multiple party throughout the downstream channel pc and consumer market are characterized by short product lifecycles which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion in addition our customer may change their inventory practice on short notice for any reason we may build inventory during period of anticipated growth and the cancellation or deferral of product order or overproduction due to failure of anticipated order to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margin factor that may result in excess or obsolete inventory which could result in write down of the value of our inventory reduction in the average selling price or reduction in our gross margin include sudden or significant decrease in demand for our product production or design defect in our product higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our product including for our older product our new product are introduced or our competitor introducing new product or taking aggressive pricing action our operating result are subject to quarterly and seasonal sale pattern the profile of our sale may be weighted differently during the year large portion of our quarterly sale have historically been made in the last month of the quarter this uneven sale pattern make prediction of revenue for each financial period difficult and increase the risk of unanticipated variation in quarterly result and financial condition in addition our operating result tend to vary seasonally with the market in which our product are sold for example historically our net revenue ha been generally higher in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year although market condition and product transition could impact these trend many of the factor that create and affect quarterly and seasonal trend are beyond our control the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving facility impose restriction on that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business the indenture governing our senior note due note contains various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing incur additional indebtedness pay dividend and make other restricted payment make certain investment including investment in our unrestricted subsidiary create or permit certain lien create or permit restriction on the ability of certain restricted subsidiary to pay dividend or make other distribution to use the proceeds from sale of asset enter certain type of transaction with affiliate and consolidate or merge or sell our asset an entirety or substantially an entirety in addition the secured revolving facility credit agreement credit agreement restricts our ability to make cash payment on the note to the extent that on the date of such payment an event of default exists under the credit agreement or would result therefrom or ii if we would have on pro forma basis after giving effect to such payment consolidated total leverage ratio that exceeds any of our future debt agreement may contain similar restriction if under certain circumstance we fail to make cash payment on series of note when required by the applicable indenture it would constitute an event of default under such indenture which in turn could constitute an event of default under the agreement governing our other indebtedness our secured revolving facility also contains various covenant which limit our ability to among other thing incur additional indebtedness and lien make certain investment merge or consolidate with other entity make certain disposition create any encumbrance on the ability of subsidiary to make any upstream payment make payment with respect to subordinated debt or certain borrowed money prior to it due date and enter into any non arm length transaction with an affiliate in each case except for certain customary exception the agreement governing our note and our secured revolving facility contain cross default provision whereby default under one agreement would likely result in cross default under agreement covering other indebtedness for example the occurrence of default with respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay indebtedness when due in an amount in excess of million would cause cross default under the indenture to the extent such default would result in the acceleration of such indebtedness governing our note and convertible senior note due note and ii million would cause cross default under the secured revolving facility the occurrence of default under any of these borrowing arrangement would permit the applicable note holder or the lender under our secured revolving facility to declare all amount outstanding under those borrowing arrangement to be immediately due and payable if the note holder or the trustee under the indenture governing our note or note or the lender under our secured revolving facility accelerate the repayment of borrowing we can not assure you that we will have sufficient asset to repay those borrowing the market in which our product are sold are highly competitive the market in which our product are sold are competitive and delivering the latest and best product to market on timely basis is critical to achieving revenue growth we believe that the main factor that determine our product competitiveness are timely product introduction product quality product feature and capability including enabling state of the art visual and virtual reality experience energy efficiency including power consumption and battery life reliability processor clock speed performance size or form factor selling price cost adherence to industry standard and the creation of open industry standard level of integration software and hardware compatibility security and stability brand recognition and availability we expect that competition will continue to be intense due to rapid technological change frequent product introduction by our competitor or new competitor of product that may provide better performance experience or may include additional feature that render our product comparatively le competitive we may also face aggressive pricing by competitor especially during challenging economic time in addition our competitor have significant marketing and sale resource which could increase the competitive environment in such declining market leading to lower price and margin some competitor may have greater access or right to complementary technology including interface processor and memory technical information for instance with our apu product and other competing solution with integrated graphic we believe that demand for additional discrete graphic chip and card may decrease in the future due to improvement in the quality and performance of integrated graphic if competitor introduce competitive new product into the market before demand for our product could be adversely impacted and our business could be adversely affected in addition intel ha announced that it plan to expand it position in integrated graphic for the pc market with high end discrete graphic solution for broad range of computing segment which may negatively impact our ability to compete in these computing segment in addition we are entering market with current and new competitor who may be able to adapt more quickly to customer requirement and emerging technology we can not assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitor who may have stronger position in these new market or superior ability to anticipate customer requirement and emerging industry trend we may face delay or disruption in research and development effort or we may be required to invest significantly greater resource in research and development than anticipated also the semiconductor industry ha seen several merger and acquisition over the last number of year further consolidation could adversely impact our business due to there being fewer supplier customer and partner in the industry conversion of the note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock the conversion of some or all of the note may dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholder the note will mature on september unless earlier redeemed or repurchased by or converted during the fourth quarter of the sale price for conversion wa satisfied of the end of december and result the note are eligible for conversion during the first calendar quarter of any sale in the public market of our common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the existence of the note may encourage short selling by market participant because the conversion thereof could be used to satisfy short position or the anticipated conversion of the note into cash and or share of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock the demand for our product depends in part on the market condition in the industry into which they are sold fluctuation in demand for our product or market decline in any of these industry could have material adverse effect on our result of operation industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future large portion of our computing and graphic revenue is focused on the consumer desktop pc and notebook segment which have in the past experienced decline driven by among other factor the adoption of smaller and other form factor increased competition and change in replacement cycle the success of our semi custom soc product is dependent on securing customer for our semi custom design pipeline and consumer market condition including the success of the sony playstation sony playstation pro microsoft xbox one and microsoft xbox one game console system worldwide in addition the gpu market ha at time seen elevated demand due to the application of gpu product to cryptocurrency mining for example our gpu revenue ha been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market demand for cryptocurrency ha changed and is likely to continue to change quickly for example china and south korea have instituted restriction on cryptocurrency trading and the valuation of the currency and corresponding interest in mining of such currency are subject to significant fluctuation if we are unable to manage the risk related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market our gpu business could be materially adversely affected our ability to design and introduce new product in timely manner is dependent upon third party intellectual property in the design and development of new and enhanced product we rely on third party intellectual property such development and testing tool for software and hardware furthermore certain product feature may rely on intellectual property acquired from third party the design requirement necessary to meet customer demand for more feature and greater functionality from semiconductor product may exceed the capability of the third party intellectual property or development or testing tool available to if the third party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame or price point needed for our new product or fails to produce design that meet customer demand our business could be materially adversely affected we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards software memory and other computer platform component to support our business we depend on third party company for the design manufacture and supply of motherboards graphic card software bios operating system driver memory and other component that our customer utilize to support and or use our microprocessor gpu and apu offering we also rely on our add in board aib partner to support our gpu and apu product in addition our microprocessor are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessor if the designer manufacturer aibs and supplier of motherboards graphic card software memory and other component cease or reduce their design manufacture or production of current or future product that are based on or support our product our business could be materially adversely affected if we lose microsoft corporation support for our product or other software vendor do not design and develop software to run on our product our ability to sell our product could be materially adversely affected our ability to innovate beyond the instruction set controlled by intel depends partially on microsoft designing and developing it operating system to run on or support our based microprocessor product with respect to our graphic product we depend in part on microsoft to design and develop it operating system to run on or support our graphic product similarly the success of our product in the market such our apu product is dependent on independent software provider designing and developing software to run on our product if microsoft doe not continue to design and develop it operating system so that they work with our instruction set or doe not continue to develop and maintain their operating system to support our graphic product independent software provider may forego designing their software application to take advantage of our innovation and customer may not purchase pc with our product in addition some software driver licensed for use our product are certified by microsoft if microsoft did not certify driver or if we otherwise fail to retain the support of microsoft or other software vendor our ability to market our product would be materially adversely affected our reliance on third party distributor and aib partner subject to certain risk we market and sell our product directly and through third party distributor and aib partner pursuant to agreement that can generally be terminated for convenience by either party upon prior notice to the other party these agreement are non exclusive and permit both our distributor and aib partner to offer our competitor product we are dependent on our distributor and aib partner to supplement our direct marketing and sale effort if any significant distributor or aib partner or substantial number of our distributor or aib partner terminated their relationship with decided to market our competitor product over our product or decided not to market our product at all our ability to bring our product to market would be impacted and we would be materially adversely affected in addition if we are unable to collect account receivable from our significant distributor and or aib partner it could have material adverse effect on our business if we are unable to manage the risk related to the use of our third party distributor and aib partner or offer appropriate incentive to focus them on the sale of our product our business could be materially adversely affected additionally distributor and aib partner typically maintain an inventory of our product in most instance our agreement with distributor protect their inventory of our product against price reduction well provide return right for any product that we have removed from our price book and that is not more than month older than the manufacturing date some agreement with our distributor also contain standard stock rotation provision permitting limited level of product return our agreement with aib partner protect their inventory of our product against price reduction in the event of significant decline in the price of our product the price protection right we offer would materially adversely affect because our revenue and corresponding gross margin would decline we may incur future impairment of goodwill and technology license purchase we perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year subsequent to our annual goodwill impairment analysis we monitor for any event or change in circumstance such significant adverse change in business climate or operating result change in management business strategy an inability to successfully introduce new product in the marketplace an inability to successfully achieve internal forecast or significant decline in our stock price which may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these event may require to record future goodwill impairment charge we license certain third party technology and tool for the design and production of our product we report the value of those license intangible asset on the balance sheet and we periodically evaluate the carrying value of those license based on their future economic benefit to factor such the life of the asset change in competing technology and change to the business strategy may represent an indicator of impairment the occurrence of any of these event may require to record future technology license impairment charge for example during the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment charge in cost of sale of million on technology license related to product that were no longer being used our inability to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel may hinder our business much of our future success depends upon the continued service our executive of numerous qualified engineering marketing sale and executive employee competition for highly skilled executive and employee in the technology industry is intense and our competitor have targeted individual in our organization that have desired skill and experience if we are not able to continue to attract train and retain our leadership team and our qualified employee necessary for our business the progress of our product development program could be hindered and we could be materially adversely affected to help attract retain and motivate our executive and qualified employee we use share based incentive award such employee stock option and non vested share unit restricted stock unit if the value of such stock award doe not appreciate measured by the performance of the price of our common stock or if our share based compensation otherwise cease to be viewed valuable benefit our ability to attract retain and motivate our executive and employee could be weakened which could harm our result of operation also if the value of our stock award increase substantially this could potentially create great personal wealth for our executive and employee and affect our ability to retain our personnel in addition any future restructuring plan may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employee our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual obligation our total debt principal amount of december wa billion our indebtedness may make it difficult for to satisfy our financial obligation including making scheduled principal and interest payment limit our ability to borrow additional fund for working capital capital expenditure acquisition and general corporate and other purpose limit our ability to use cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditure acquisition or other general corporate purpose require to use substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to make debt service payment place at competitive disadvantage compared to our competitor with relatively le debt and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry condition we enter into sale and factoring arrangement from time to time with respect to certain account receivables which arrangement are non recourse to in the event that an account debtor fails to pay for credit related reason and are not included in our indebtedness we could become obligated to repurchase such account receivables or otherwise incur liability to the counterparties under these arrangement under certain circumstance such where commercial dispute arises between and an account debtor we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt obligation or meet our working capital requirement our ability to make payment on and to refinance our debt will depend on our financial and operating performance which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic financial and business condition along with other factor many of which are beyond our control we can not assure you that we will be able to generate cash flow or that we will be able to borrow fund including under our secured revolving credit facility for principal amount up to million our secured revolving facility in amount sufficient to enable to service our debt or to meet our working capital requirement if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operation or to borrow sufficient fund to service our debt we may be required to sell asset or equity reduce expenditure refinance all or portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing we can not assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt sell asset or equity borrow fund under our secured revolving facility or borrow more fund on term acceptable to if at all in the event of change of control we may not be able to repurchase our outstanding debt required by the applicable indenture and our secured revolving facility which would result in default under the indenture and our secured revolving facility upon change of control we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our note and note then outstanding at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest if any up to but excluding the repurchase date in addition change of control would be an event of default under our secured revolving facility of december billion principal amount wa outstanding under our note future debt agreement may contain similar provision we may not have the financial resource to repurchase our outstanding note and prepay all of our outstanding obligation under our secured revolving facility the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced severe downturn that have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our business in the future the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and ha experienced significant downturn often in conjunction with constant and rapid technological change wide fluctuation in supply and demand continuous new product introduction price erosion and decline in general economic condition we have incurred substantial loss in recent downturn due to substantial decline in average selling price the cyclical nature of supply and demand imbalance in the semiconductor industry decline in demand for end user product such pc that incorporate our product and excess inventory level industry wide fluctuation in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected in the past and may materially adversely affect in the future global economic uncertainty and weakness have in the past impacted the semiconductor market consumer and business have deferred purchase which negatively impacted demand for our product our financial performance ha been and may in the future be negatively affected by these downturn the growth of our business is also dependent on continued demand for our product from high growth adjacent emerging global market our ability to be successful in such market depends in part on our ability to establish adequate local infrastructure well our ability to cultivate and maintain local relationship in these market if demand from these market is below our expectation sale of our product may decrease which would have material adverse effect on acquisition joint venture and or investment could disrupt our business and or dilute or adversely affect the price of our common stock our success will depend in part on our ability to expand our product offering and grow our business in response to changing technology customer demand and competitive pressure in some circumstance we may pursue growth through the acquisition of complementary business solution or technology or through joint venture or investment rather than through internal development the identification of suitable acquisition or joint venture candidate can be difficult time consuming and costly and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisition or joint venture moreover if such acquisition or joint require to seek additional debt or equity financing we may not be able to obtain such financing on term favorable to or at all even if we successfully complete an acquisition or joint venture we may not be able to assimilate and integrate effectively or efficiently the acquired business technology solution asset personnel or operation particularly if key personnel of the acquired company decide not to work for acquisition and joint venture may also involve the entry into geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience consequently we may not achieve anticipated benefit of the acquisition or joint venture which could harm our operating result in addition to complete an acquisition we may issue equity security which would dilute our stockholder ownership and could adversely affect the price of our common stock well incur debt assume contingent liability or have amortization expense and write down of acquired asset which could adversely affect our result of operation acquisition and joint venture may also reduce our cash available for operation and other us which could harm our business also any failure on our part to effectively evaluate and execute new business initiative could adversely affect our business we may not adequately ass the risk of new business initiative and subsequent event may arise that alter the risk that were initially considered furthermore we may not achieve the objective and expectation with respect to future operation product and service the majority of our atmp service are provided by the jv and there is no guarantee that the jv will be able to fulfill our long term atmp requirement if we are unable to meet customer demand due to fluctuating or late supply from the jv it could result in lost sale and have material adverse effect on our business in addition we may not realize the anticipated benefit from any new business initiative such the thatic jv we may not realize the expected benefit from the thatic jv expected future performance the receipt of any future milestone payment and royalty from certain licensed intellectual property in june the united state commerce department bureau of industry and security added certain chinese entity to the entity list including thatic and the thatic jv we are complying with law pertaining to the entity list designation our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business process and information system and modification or interruption of such system may disrupt our business process and internal control we rely upon number of internal business process and information system to support key business function and the efficient operation of these process and system is critical to our business our business process and information system need to be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modification or upgrade that expose to number of operational risk such our information system will continually evolve and adapt in order to meet our business need these change may be costly and disruptive to our operation and could impose substantial demand on management time these change may also require change in our information system modification of internal control procedure and significant training of employee and third party resource we continuously work on simplifying our information system and application through consolidation and standardization effort there can be no assurance that our business and operation will not experience any disruption in connection with this transition our information technology system and those of third party information technology provider or business partner may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstance beyond our control including catastrophic event power anomaly or outage natural disaster virus or malware cyber attack data breach and computer system or network failure exposing to significant cost reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business in addition our it environment continues to evolve we are embracing new way of communicating and sharing data internally and externally with customer and partner using method such mobility and the cloud that can promote business efficiency however these practice can also result in more distributed it environment making it more difficult for to maintain visibility and control over internal and external user and meet scalability and administrative requirement if our security control can not keep pace with the speed of these change or if we are not able to meet regulatory and compliance requirement our business would be materially adversely affected if essential equipment material or manufacturing process are not available to manufacture our product we could be materially adversely affected we may purchase equipment and material for use by our back end manufacturing service provider from number of supplier and our operation depend upon obtaining delivery of adequate supply of equipment and material on timely basis our third party supplier also depend on the same timely delivery of adequate quantity of equipment and material in the manufacture of our product in addition many of our product increase in technical complexity we rely on our third party supplier to update their process in order to continue meeting our back end manufacturing need certain equipment and material that are used in the manufacture of our product are available only from limited number of supplier or in some case sole supplier we also depend on limited number of supplier to provide the majority of certain type of integrated circuit package for our microprocessor including our apu product similarly certain non proprietary material or component such memory printed circuit board pcbs interposers substrate and capacitor used in the manufacture of our product are available from only limited number of source because some of the equipment and material that we and our third party manufacturing supplier purchase are complex it is sometimes difficult to substitute one supplier for another from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit supply or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor also some of these material and component may be subject to rapid change in price and availability interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortage and price increase in various essential material dependence on sole supplier or limited number of supplier exacerbates these risk if we are unable to procure certain of these material for our back end manufacturing operation or our third party foundry or manufacturing supplier are unable to procure material for manufacturing our product our business would be materially adversely affected if our product are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware we could be materially adversely affected our product may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware further we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problem in timely manner if our customer are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware we could be materially adversely affected in addition the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our product could have material adverse effect on our business cost related to defective product could have material adverse effect on product complex those we offer may contain defect or failure when first introduced or when new version or enhancement to existing product are released we can not assure you that despite our testing procedure error will not be found in new product or release after commencement of commercial shipment in the future which could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our product material recall and replacement cost loss of revenue writing the inventory of defective product the diversion of the attention of our engineering personnel from product development effort defending against litigation related to defective product or related liability including property damage personal injury damage to our reputation in the industry and loss of data or intangible property and could adversely affect our relationship with our customer in addition we may have difficulty identifying the end customer of the defective product in the field result we could incur substantial cost to implement modification to correct defect any of these problem could materially adversely affect our business we could be subject to potential product liability claim if one of our product cause or merely appears to have caused an injury whether tangible or intangible claim may be made by consumer or others selling our product and we may be subject to claim against even if an alleged injury is due to the action of others product liability claim recall or other claim with respect to uninsured liability or for amount in excess of insured liability could have material adverse effect on our business if we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain we respond to change in customer demand for our product our business could be materially adversely affected our ability to meet customer demand for our product depends in part on our ability to deliver the product our customer want on timely basis accordingly we rely on our supply chain for the manufacturing distribution and fulfillment of our product we continue to grow our business expand to high growth adjacent market acquire new customer and strengthen relationship with existing customer the efficiency of our supply chain will become increasingly important because many of our customer tend to have specific requirement for particular product and specific time frame in which they require delivery of these product if we are unable to consistently deliver the right product to our customer on timely basis in the right location our customer may reduce the quantity they order from which could have material adverse effect on our business we outsource to third party certain supply chain logistics function including portion of our product distribution transportation management and information technology support service we rely on third party provider to operate our regional product distribution center and to manage the transportation of our work in process and finished product among our facility to our manufacturing supplier and to our customer in addition we rely on third party to provide certain information technology service to including help desk support desktop application service business and software support application server and storage administration data center operation database administration and voice video and remote access we can not guarantee that these provider will fulfill their respective responsibility in timely manner in accordance with the contract term in which case our internal operation and the distribution of our product to our customer could be materially adversely affected also we can not guarantee that our contract with these third party provider will be renewed in which case we would have to transition these function in house or secure new provider which could have material adverse effect on our business if the transition is not executed appropriately stock price is subject to volatility our stock price ha experienced price and volume fluctuation and could be subject to wide fluctuation in the future the trading price of our stock may fluctuate widely due to various factor including actual or anticipated fluctuation in our financial condition and operating result change in financial estimate by or financial estimate and rating by security analyst change in our capital structure including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public interest rate change news regarding our product or product of our competitor and broad market and industry fluctuation stock price fluctuation could impact the value of our equity compensation which could affect our ability to recruit and retain employee in addition volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunity worldwide political condition may adversely affect demand for our product worldwide political condition may create uncertainty that could adversely affect our business the united state ha been and may continue to be involved in armed conflict that could have further impact on our sale and our supply chain the consequence of armed conflict political instability or civil or military unrest are unpredictable and we may not be able to foresee event that could have material adverse effect on terrorist attack or other hostile act may negatively affect our operation or adversely affect demand for our product and such attack or related armed conflict may impact our physical facility or those of our supplier or customer furthermore these attack or hostile act may make travel and the transportation of our product more difficult and more expensive which could materially adversely affect any of these event could cause consumer spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united state economy and worldwide financial market unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect we have cost asset and liability that are denominated in foreign currency consequence movement in exchange rate could cause our foreign currency denominated expense to increase percentage of revenue affecting our profitability and cash flow whenever we believe appropriate we hedge portion of our short term foreign currency exposure to protect against fluctuation in currency exchange rate we determine our total foreign currency exposure using projection of long term expenditure for item such payroll we can not assure you that these activity will be effective in reducing foreign exchange rate exposure failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition result of operation and cash flow in addition the majority of our product sale are denominated in dollar fluctuation in the exchange rate between the dollar and the local currency can cause increase or decrease in the cost of our product in the local currency of such customer an appreciation of the dollar relative to the local currency could reduce sale of our product our inability to effectively control the sale of our product on the gray market could have material adverse effect on we market and sell our product directly to oems and through authorized third party distributor from time to time our product are diverted from our authorized distribution channel and are sold on the gray market gray market product result in shadow inventory that is not visible to thus making it difficult to forecast demand accurately also when gray market product enter the market we and our distribution channel compete with these heavily discounted gray market product which adversely affect demand for our product and negatively impact our margin in addition our inability to control gray market activity could result in customer satisfaction issue because any time product are purchased outside our authorized distribution channel there is risk that our customer are buying counterfeit or substandard product including product that may have been altered mishandled or damaged or are used product represented new if we can not adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the united state and abroad through patent copyright trade secret trademark and other measure we may lose competitive advantage and incur significant expense we rely on combination of protection provided by contract including confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement copyright patent trademark and common law right such trade secret to protect our intellectual property however we can not assure you that we will be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property from third party infringement or from misappropriation in the united state and abroad any patent licensed by or issued to could be challenged invalidated or circumvented or right granted there under may not provide competitive advantage to furthermore patent application that we file may not result in issuance of patent or if patent is issued the patent may not be issued in form that is advantageous to despite our effort to protect our intellectual property right others may independently develop similar product duplicate our product or design around our patent and other right in addition it is difficult to monitor compliance with and enforce our intellectual property on worldwide basis in cost effective manner in jurisdiction where foreign law provide le intellectual property protection than afforded in the united state and abroad our technology or other intellectual property may be compromised and our business would be materially adversely affected are party to litigation and may become party to other claim or litigation that could cause to incur substantial cost or pay substantial damage or prohibit from selling our product from time to time we are defendant or plaintiff in various legal action for example described in note of our consolidated financial statement we have been subject to certain claim concerning federal security law and corporate governance our product are purchased by and or used by consumer which could increase our exposure to consumer action such product liability claim and consumer class action claim including those described in note of our consolidated financial statement on occasion we receive claim that individual were allegedly exposed to substance used in our former semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility and that this alleged exposure caused harm litigation can involve complex factual and legal question and it outcome is uncertain it is possible that if claim is successfully asserted against including the claim described in note of our consolidated financial statement it could result in the payment of damage that could be material to our business with respect to intellectual property litigation from time to time we have been notified of or third party may bring or have brought action against and or against our customer based on allegation that we are infringing the intellectual property right of others contributing to or inducing the infringement of the intellectual property right of others improperly claiming ownership of intellectual property or otherwise improperly using the intellectual property of others if any such claim are asserted we may seek to obtain license under the third party intellectual property right we can not assure you that we will be able to obtain all of the necessary license on satisfactory term if at all these party may file lawsuit against or our customer seeking damage potentially up to and including treble damage or an injunction against the sale of product that incorporate allegedly infringed intellectual property or against the operation of our business presently conducted which could result in our having to stop the sale of some of our product or to increase the cost of selling some of our product or which could damage our reputation the award of damage including material royalty payment or other type of damage or the entry of an injunction against the manufacture and sale of some or all of our product could have material adverse effect on we could decide in the alternative to redesign our product or to resort to litigation to challenge such claim such challenge could be extremely expensive and time consuming regardless of their merit could cause delay in product release or shipment and or could have material adverse effect on we can not assure you that litigation related to our intellectual property right or the intellectual property right of others can always be avoided or successfully concluded even if we were to prevail any litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operation which could have material adverse effect on our business is subject to potential tax liability we are subject to income tax indirect tax or other tax claim by tax agency in jurisdiction in which we conduct business significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income tax tax law are dynamic and subject to change new law are passed and new interpretation of the law are issued or applied the tax cut and job act of the tax reform act contains many significant change to the federal income tax law which the consequence of could have material impact on the value of our deferred tax asset and could increase our future income tax expense additional regulatory guidance is issued by the applicable taxing authority and new accounting treatment is clarified we may report additional adjustment in the period if new information becomes available we have significant amount of deferred tax asset and portion of the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss or tax credit could be subject to limitation under internal revenue code section or separate return loss year rule or dual consolidated loss rule the limitation could reduce the ability of the company to be able to utilize the net operating loss or tax credit before the expiration of the tax attribute tax law change or the limitation could be material and could materially affect our tax obligation and effective tax rate in the ordinary course of our business there are many transaction and calculation where the ultimate income tax indirect tax or other tax determination is uncertain although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable we can not assure that the final determination of any tax audit and litigation will not be materially different from that which is reflected in historical tax provision and accrual should additional tax be assessed result of an audit assessment or litigation there could be material adverse effect on our cash tax provision and net income in the period or period for which that determination is made we are subject to environmental law conflict mineral related provision of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act well variety of other law or regulation that could result in additional cost and liability our operation and property have in the past been and continue to be subject to various united state and foreign law and regulation including those relating to material used in our product and manufacturing process discharge of pollutant into the environment the treatment transport storage and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and remediation of contamination these law and regulation require our supplier to obtain permit for operation making our product including the discharge of air pollutant and wastewater although our management system are designed to oversee our supplier compliance we can not assure you that our supplier have been or will be at all time in complete compliance with such law regulation and permit our supplier violate or fail to comply with any of them range of consequence could result including fine suspension of production alteration of manufacturing process import export restriction sale limitation criminal and civil liability or other sanction such non compliance from our manufacturing supplier could result in disruption in supply higher sourcing cost and or reputational damage for environmental law are complex change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time for example the european union eu and china are two among growing number of jurisdiction that have enacted restriction on the use of lead and other material in electronic product these regulation affect semiconductor device and packaging regulation restricting material in electronic product continue to increase around the world there is risk that the cost quality and manufacturing yield of product that are subject to these restriction may be le favorable compared to product that are not subject to such restriction or that the transition to compliant product may not meet customer roadmaps or produce sudden change in demand which may result in excess inventory number of jurisdiction including the eu australia california and china are developing or have finalized market entry or public procurement regulation for computer and server based on energy star specification well additional energy consumption limit there is the potential for certain of our product being excluded from some of these market which could materially adversely affect certain environmental law including the united state comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of or the superfund act impose strict or under certain circumstance joint and several liability on current and previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substance and impose liability for damage to natural resource these law often impose liability even if the owner or operator did not know of or wa not responsible for the release of such hazardous substance these environmental law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated such person can be responsible for cleanup cost even if they never owned or operated the contaminated facility we have been named responsible party at three superfund site in sunnyvale california although we have not yet been we could be named potentially responsible party at other superfund or contaminated site in the future in addition contamination that ha not yet been identified could exist at our other facility under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of the sec adopted disclosure and reporting requirement for company that use conflict mineral originating from the democratic republic of congo or adjoining country we continue to incur additional cost associated with complying with these requirement such cost related to developing internal control for the due diligence process determining the source of any conflict mineral used in our product auditing the process and reporting to our customer and the sec in addition to the sec regulation the european union china and other jurisdiction are developing new policy focused on conflict mineral that may impact and increase the cost of our compliance program also since our supply chain is complex we may face reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origin of the subject mineral moreover we are likely to encounter challenge to satisfy those customer who require that all of the component of our product are certified conflict free if we can not satisfy these customer they may choose competitor product the united state federal government ha issued new policy for federal procurement focused on eradicating the practice of forced labor and human trafficking germany federal procurement office in collaboration with the bitkom trade association issued new supply chain labor requirement in addition the united kingdom australia and the state of california have issued law that require to disclose our policy and practice for identifying and eliminating forced labor and human trafficking in our supply chain several customer well the responsible business alliance have also issued expectation to eliminate these practice that may impact while we have policy and management system to identify and avoid these practice in our supply chain we can not guarantee that our supplier will always be in conformance to these law and expectation we may face enforcement liability and reputational challenge if we are unable to sufficiently meet these expectation moreover we are likely to encounter challenge with customer if we can not satisfy their forced and trafficked labor police and they may choose competitor product item unresolved staff

up from billion at the end of we made significant progress towards improving our balance sheet in we reduced our debt principal amount of total debt of december wa million compared to billion of december we intend the discussion of our financial condition and result of operation that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statement the change in certain key item in those financial statement from period to period the primary factor that resulted in those change and how certain accounting principle policy and estimate affect our financial statement accounting estimatesour discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap the preparation of our financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount in our consolidated financial statement we evaluate our estimate on an on going basis including those related to our revenue inventory goodwill impairment and income tax we base our estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability although actual result have historically been reasonably consistent with management expectation the actual result may differ from these estimate or our estimate may be affected by different assumption or condition management belief the following critical accounting estimate are the most significant to the presentation of our financial statement and require the most difficult subjective and complex judgment revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the shipment of the product to our distributor sell in rather than upon the resale of the product by our distributor to their customer sell through accordingly we have established provision for right of return and price protection on unsold product held by our distributor revenue allowance we record provision for estimated sale return and allowance on product sale for estimated future price reduction and other customer incentive in the same period that the related revenue are recorded we base these estimate on actual historical sale return historical allowance historical price reduction market activity and other known or anticipated trend and factor these estimate are subject to management judgment and actual provision could be different from our estimate and current provision resulting in future adjustment to our revenue and operating result inventory valuation at each balance sheet date we evaluate our ending inventory for excess quantity and obsolescence based on projected sale outlook this evaluation includes analysis of historical sale level by product and projection of future demand these projection assist in determining the carrying value of our inventory in addition we write off inventory that we consider obsolete we adjust the remaining specific inventory balance to approximate the lower of our actual cost or estimated net realizable value among other factor management considers recent historical activity well anticipated or forecasted demand estimate of future selling price competitiveness of product offering market and industry condition customer requirement and product life cycle when determining excess obsolescence and net realizable value in relation to the inventory on hand if in any period we anticipate future demand or market condition to be le favorable than our previous estimate additional inventory write down may be required and would be reflected in cost of sale in the period the revision is made this would have negative impact on our gross margin in that period if in any period we are able to sell inventory that were not valued or that had been written down in previous period related revenue would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sale resulting in net benefit to our gross margin in that period goodwill we perform our goodwill impairment analysis of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and if certain event or circumstance indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred on more frequent basis the analysis may include both qualitative and quantitative factor to ass the likelihood of an impairment qualitative factor include industry and market consideration overall financial performance share price trend and market capitalization and company specific event we first analyze qualitative factor if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount we do not proceed to perform quantitative impairment test if we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to it carrying value quantitative impairment analysis if necessary considers the income approach which requires estimate of the present value of expected future cash flow to determine reporting unit fair value significant estimate include revenue growth rate and operating margin used to calculate projected future cash flow

place it investment with high credit quality financial institution and by policy limit the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution at the time an investment is made investment in commercial paper of industrial firm and financial institution are rated or better the company invests in tax exempt security including municipal note and bond and bond that are rated or better and repurchase agreement each of which have security of the type and quality listed above collateral the company belief that concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because large number of geographically diverse customer make up the company customer base thus diluting the trade credit risk the company top three customer with the highest account receivable balance each accounted for approximately and respectively of the total consolidated account receivable balance of december and and respectively of the total consolidated account receivable balance of december however the company doe not believe the receivable balance from these customer represents significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality the company manages it exposure to customer credit risk through credit limit credit line ongoing monitoring procedure and credit approval furthermore the company performs in depth credit evaluation of all new customer and at interval for existing customer from this the company may require letter of credit bank or corporate guarantee or advance payment if deemed necessary the company existing derivative financial instrument are with large international financial institution of investment grade credit rating the company doe not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the company monitor their credit rating on an ongoing basis by using derivative instrument the company is subject to credit and market risk if counter party fails to fulfill it performance obligation under derivative contract the company credit risk will equal the fair value of the derivative instrument generally when the fair value of derivative contract is positive the counter party owes the company thus creating receivable risk for the company based upon certain factor including review of the credit default swap rate for the company counter party the company determined it counter party credit risk to be immaterial at december the company obligation under the contract did not exceed counter party obligation the company is dependent on certain equipment and
