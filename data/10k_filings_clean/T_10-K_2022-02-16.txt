concerning forward looking statement you should carefully read the matter described below we believe that each of these matter could materially affect our business we recognize that most of these factor are beyond our ability to control and therefore we can not predict an outcome inc dollar in million except per share amountsmacro economic factor adverse change in the security market interest rate and medical cost could materially increase our benefit plan cost and future funding requirement our cost to provide current benefit and funding for future benefit are subject to increase primarily due to continuing increase in medical and prescription drug cost and can be affected by lower return on asset held by our pension and other benefit plan which are reflected in our financial statement for that year in calculating the recognized benefit cost we have made certain assumption regarding future investment return interest rate and medical cost these assumption could change significantly over time and could be materially different than originally projected lower than assumed investment return decline in interest rate with corresponding increase in our benefit obligation and higher than assumed medical and prescription drug cost will increase expense the financial accounting standard board requires company to recognize the funded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plan an asset or liability in their statement of financial position and to recognize change in that funded status in the year in which the change occur we have elected to reflect the annual adjustment to the funded status in our consolidated statement of income therefore an increase in our cost or adverse market condition will have negative effect on our operating result significant adverse change in capital market could result in the deterioration of our defined benefit plan funded status and result in increased contribution requirement for such plan which could be material inflationary pressure on cost such input for device we sell and network component labor and distribution cost may impact our network construction our financial condition or result of operation provider of telecommunication and technology service we sell handset wireless data card wireless computing device and customer premise equipment manufactured by various supplier for use with our voice and data service and depend on supplier to provide directly or through other supplier with item such network equipment customer premise equipment and wireless related equipment such mobile hotspot handset wirelessly enabled computer wireless data card and other connected device for our customer in and the early part of the cost of these input and the cost of labor necessary to develop and maintain our network and our product and service have rapidly increased in addition many of these input are subject to price fluctuation from number of factor including but not limited to market condition demand for raw material used in the production of these device and network component weather climate change energy cost currency fluctuation supplier capacity governmental action import and export requirement including tariff and other factor beyond our control although we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source material in the future we expect these supply pressure to continue into we also expect the pressure of input cost inflation to continue into our attempt to offset these cost pressure such through increase in the selling price of some of our product and service may not be successful higher product price may result in reduction in sale volume consumer may be le willing to pay price differential for our product and may increasingly purchase lower priced offering or may forego some purchase altogether during an economic downturn to the extent that price increase are not sufficient to offset these increased cost adequately or in timely manner and or if they result in significant decrease in sale volume our business financial condition or operating result may be adversely affected furthermore we may not be able to offset any cost increase through productivity and cost saving initiative adverse change in global financial market could limit our ability and our larger customer ability to access capital or increase the cost of capital needed to fund business operation during uncertainty surrounding global growth rate and the impact of the covid pandemic continued to produce volatility in the credit currency and equity market volatility may affect company access to the credit market leading to higher borrowing cost or in some case the inability to fund ongoing operation in addition we contract with large financial institution to support our own treasury operation including contract to hedge our exposure on interest rate and foreign exchange and the funding of credit line and other short term debt obligation including commercial paper these financial institution face stricter capital related and other regulation in the united state and europe well ongoing legal and financial issue concerning their loan portfolio which may hamper their ability to provide credit or raise the cost of providing such credit inc dollar in million except per share amountsthe financial conduct authority which regulates libor ha announced that it intends to phase libor in although our security may provide for alternative method of calculating the interest rate payable on such indebtedness uncertainty to the extent and manner of future change may adversely affect the current trading market for libor based security and the value of variable rate indebtedness in general company cost of borrowing is also affected by evaluation given by various credit rating agency and these agency have been applying tighter credit standard when evaluating debt level and future growth prospect while we have been successful in continuing to access the credit and fixed income market when needed adverse change in the financial market could render either unable to access these market or able to access these market only at higher interest cost and with restrictive financial or other condition severely affecting our business operation additionally downgrade of our credit rating by the major credit rating agency could increase our cost of borrowing and also impact the collateral we would be required to post under certain agreement we have entered into with our derivative counterparties which could negatively impact our liquidity further valuation change in our derivative portfolio due to interest rate and foreign exchange rate could require to post collateral and thus may negatively impact our liquidity our international operation have increased our exposure to political instability to change in the international economy and to the level of regulation on our business and these risk could offset our expected growth opportunity we have international operation including in mexico and worldwide through warnermedia content distribution we need to comply with wide variety of complex local law regulation and treaty we are exposed to restriction on cash repatriation foreign exchange control fluctuation in currency value change in relationship between and foreign government trade restriction including potential tariff difference in intellectual property protection law and other regulation that may affect materially our earnings our mexico operation in particular rely on continuation of

pattern increased inflation currency devaluation foreign exchange control instability in the banking sector and high unemployment should these condition persist our ability to offer service in one or

and resulting mitigation measure have caused and may continue to cause negative effect on our operating result at the onset in mitigation measure caused sport league to modify their season and suspend certain operation which adversely affected our advertising revenue and resulted in contract dispute concerning carriage right that caused to incur expense relating to certain of these sporting event notwithstanding their cancellation the closure or avoidance of theater and the interruption in movie production and other programming caused by covid are expected to continue to impact the timing of revenue and may cause loss of revenue to our warnermedia business over the long term the covid pandemic also drove higher cost for our warnermedia business in based on the hybrid distribution model for releasing film in and cost associated with safety measure put in place to help provide safe environment for content production if the mitigation measure or the associated effect are prolonged we expect business customer in industry most significantly impacted will continue to reduce or terminate service negative effect on the performance of our business wireline business unit further concern over the covid pandemic could result in the closure of many of our retail store temporarily or permanently and deter customer from accessing our store even the pandemic subsides these pandemic concern may also result in continued impact to our customer ability to pay for our product and service we may also continue to see significant impact on roaming revenue due to downturn in international travel the covid pandemic ha caused and could further cause reduced staffing level at our call center and field operation resulting in delay in service further reduction in staffing level could additionally limit our ability to provide service adversely impacting our competitive position we may also incur significantly higher expense attributable to infrastructure investment required to meet higher network utilization from more customer consuming bandwidth from change in work from home trend extended cancellation period and increased labor cost if the covid pandemic continues for an extended period inc dollar in million except per share amountsthe covid pandemic and mitigation measure have caused and may continue to cause adverse impact on global economic condition and consumer confidence spending and consumer behavior which could affect demand for our product and service the extent to which the covid pandemic impact our business result of operation cash flow and financial condition will depend on future development that are highly uncertain and can not be predicted including new information that may emerge concerning other strain of the virus and the action to contain it impact due to the speed with which the situation continues to develop and change we are not able at this time to estimate the additional impact of covid on our financial or operational result but the impact could be material change to federal state and foreign government regulation and decision in regulatory proceeding well private litigation could further increase our operating cost and or alter customer perception of our operation which could materially adversely affect our subsidiary providing wired service are subject to significant federal and state regulation while many of our competitor are not in addition our subsidiary and affiliate operating outside the united state are also subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authority in the market where service is provided our wireless and various video subsidiary are regulated to varying degree by the fcc and in some instance by state and local agency adverse regulation and ruling by the fcc relating to broadband and wireless deployment could impede our ability to manage our network and recover cost and lessen incentive to invest in our network the continuing growth of ip based service especially when accessed by wireless device ha created or potentially could create conflicting regulation between the fcc and various state and local authority which may involve lengthy litigation to resolve and may result in outcome unfavorable to in addition in response to the faa questioning whether our band launch could impact radio altimeter equipment on airplane we voluntarily committed to series of temporary precautionary measure in addition to deferring turning on limited number of tower around certain airport to allow the faa more time to evaluate the faa continued evaluation may impact our planned band launch in certain area in addition increased public focus on variety of issue related to our operation such privacy issue government request or order for customer data and concern about global climate change have led to proposal or new legislation at state federal and foreign government level to change or increase regulation on our operation enactment of new privacy law and regulation could among other thing adversely affect our ability to collect and offer targeted advertisement or result in additional cost of compliance or litigation should customer decide that our competitor offer more customer friendly environment our competitive position result of operation or financial condition could be materially adversely affected effect of climate change may impose risk of damage to our infrastructure our ability to provide service and may cause change in federal state and foreign government regulation all of which may result in potential adverse impact to our financial result extreme weather event precipitated by long term climate change have the potential to directly damage network facility or disrupt our ability to build and maintain portion of our network and could potentially disrupt supplier ability to provide product and service required to provide reliable network coverage any such disruption could delay network deployment plan interrupt service for our customer increase our cost and have negative effect on our operating result the potential physical effect of climate change such increased frequency and severity of storm flood fire freezing condition sea level rise and other climate related event could adversely affect our operation infrastructure and financial result operational impact resulting from the potential physical effect of climate change such damage to our network infrastructure could result in increased cost and loss of revenue we could incur significant cost to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for respond to and mitigate such physical effect of climate change we are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential loss or cost associated with the physical effect of climate change further customer consumer investor and other stakeholder are increasingly focusing on environmental issue including climate change water use deforestation plastic waste and other sustainability concern concern over climate change or other environmental social and governance esg matter may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirement to reduce or mitigate impact to the environment and reduce the impact of our business on climate change further climate change regulation may require to alter our proposed business plan or increase our operating cost due to increased regulation or environmental consideration and could adversely affect our business and reputation inc dollar in million except per share amountscontinuing growth in and the converging nature of wireless and broadband service will require to deploy significant amount of capital and require ongoing access to spectrum in order to provide attractive service to customer wireless and broadband service are undergoing rapid and significant technological change and dramatic increase in usage in particular the demand for faster and seamless usage of data including video across mobile and fixed device the covid pandemic ha accelerated these change and also resulted in higher network utilization more customer consume bandwidth from change in work from home trend we must continually invest in our network in order to improve our wireless and broadband service to meet this increasing demand and change in customer expectation while remaining competitive improvement in these service depend on many factor including continued access to and deployment of adequate spectrum and the capital needed to expand our wireline network to support transport of these service in order to stem broadband subscriber loss to cable competitor in our non fiber wireline area we have been expanding our all fiber wireline network we must maintain and expand our network capacity and coverage for transport of data including video and voice between cell and fixed landline site to this end we participate in spectrum auction and continue to deploy software and other technology advancement in order to efficiently invest in our network network service enhancement and product launch may not occur scheduled or at the cost expected due to many factor including delay in determining equipment and wireless handset operating standard supplier delay software issue increase in network and handset component cost regulatory permitting delay for tower site or enhancement or labor related delay deployment of new technology also may adversely affect the performance of the network for existing service if we can not acquire needed spectrum or deploy the service customer desire on timely basis with acceptable quality and at reasonable cost our ability to attract and retain customer and therefore maintain and improve our operating margin could be materially adversely affected increasing competition for wireless customer could materially adversely affect our operating result we have multiple wireless competitor in each of our service area and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network quality coverage area and customer service in addition we are facing growing competition from provider offering service using advanced wireless technology and ip based network we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to moderate in comparison with historical growth rate leading to increased competition for customer our share of industry sale could be reduced due to aggressive pricing strategy pursued by competitor we also expect that our customer growing demand for high speed video and data service will place constraint on our network capacity these competition and capacity constraint will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to respond will depend among other thing on continued improvement in network quality and customer service and our ability to price our product and service competitively well effective marketing of attractive product and service these effort will involve significant expense and require strategic management decision on and timely implementation of equipment choice network deployment and service offering intellectual property right may be adversely affected by piracy or be inadequate to take advantage of business opportunity such new distribution platform which may materially adversely affect our operation increased piracy of video content product and other intellectual property particularly in our foreign warnermedia operation will decrease revenue technological development have made it easier to reproduce and distribute high quality unauthorized copy of content piracy is particularly prevalent in country that lack effective copyright and other legal protection or enforcement measure and thief can attract user throughout the world effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country where we operate we may need to spend significant amount of money to protect our right we are also increasingly negotiating broader licensing agreement to expand our ability to use new method to distribute content to customer any impairment of our intellectual property right including due to change in or foreign intellectual property law or the absence of effective legal protection or enforcement measure or our inability to negotiate broader distribution right could materially adversely impact our operation inc dollar in million except per share amountsincidents leading to damage to our reputation and any resulting

those currently or formerly associated with and from any number of activity or circumstance including operation employment related offense such sexual harassment and discrimination regulatory compliance and action taken by regulator or others in response to such conduct we have in the past been and may in the future be named defendant in lawsuit claim and other legal proceeding that arise in the ordinary course of our business based on alleged act of misconduct by employee these action seek among other thing compensation for alleged personal injury including claim for loss of life worker compensation employment discrimination sexual harassment workplace misconduct wage and hour claim and other employment related damage compensation for breach of contract statutory or regulatory

even if reserved could materially and adversely affect our business reputation financial condition result of operation and cash flow company specific financial factor adoption of new software based technology may involve quality and supply chain issue and could increase capital cost the communication and digital entertainment industry ha experienced rapid change in the past several year an increasing number of our customer are using mobile device the primary mean of viewing video and an increasing number of nontraditional video provider are developing content and technology to satisfy the desire for video entertainment demand in addition business and government body are broadly shifting to wireless based service for home and infrastructure to improve service to their respective customer and constituency we have spent and continue to spend significant capital to shift our wired network to software based technology to manage this demand and are expanding wireless technology to address these consumer demand we are entering into significant number of software licensing agreement and working with software developer to provide network function in lieu of installing switch or other physical network equipment in order to respond to rapid development in video and wireless demand while software based functionality can be changed much more quickly than for example physical switch the rapid pace of development mean that we may increasingly need to rely on single source and software solution that have not previously been deployed in production environment should this software not function intended or our license agreement provide inadequate protection from intellectual property infringement claim we could be forced to either substitute if available or else spend time to develop alternative technology at much higher cost and incur harm to our reputation for reliability and result our ability to remain competitive could be materially adversely affected inc dollar in million except per share amountswe depend on various supplier to provide equipment to operate our business and satisfy customer demand and interruption or delay in supply can adversely impact our operating result we depend on supplier to provide directly or through other supplier with item such network equipment customer premise equipment and wireless related equipment such mobile hotspot handset wirelessly enabled computer wireless data card and other connected device for our customer these supplier could fail to provide equipment on timely basis or fail to meet our performance expectation for number of reason including difficulty in obtaining export license for certain technology inability to secure component part general business disruption natural disaster safety issue economic and political instability and public health emergency such the covid pandemic the covid pandemic ha caused and may again cause delay in the development manufacturing including the sourcing of key component and shipment of product in certain limited circumstance supplier have been unable to supply product in timely fashion in such limited circumstance we have been unable to provide product and service precisely and when requested by our customer it is possible that in some circumstance we could be forced to switch to different key supplier because of the cost and time lag that can be associated with transitioning from one supplier to another our business could be substantially disrupted if we were required to or chose to replace the product of one or more key supplier with product from another source especially if the replacement became necessary on short notice any such disruption could increase our cost decrease our operating efficiency and have negative effect on our operating result increasing cost to provide service and failure to renew agreement on favorable term or at all could adversely affect operating margin our operating cost including customer acquisition and retention cost could continue to put pressure on margin and customer retention level number of our competitor offering comparable legacy service that rely on alternative technology and business model are typically subject to le or no regulation and therefore are able to operate with lower cost these competitor generally can focus on discrete customer segment since they do not have regulatory obligation to provide universal service also these competitor have cost advantage compared to due in part to operating on newer more technically advanced and lower cost network with nonunionized workforce lower employee benefit and fewer retiree we are transitioning service from our old copper based network and seeking regulatory approval where needed at both the state and federal level if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our network transition or obtain approval with onerous condition we could experience significant cost and competitive disadvantage our warnermedia operation which create and license content to other provider may experience increasing difficulty securing favorable term including those related to pricing positioning and packaging during contract negotiation which may lead to blackout of warnermedia programming and warnermedia may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of it network and premium pay television service in offering by third party we may not realize or sustain the expected benefit from our business transformation initiative and these effort could have materially adverse effect on our business operation financial condition result of operation and competitive position we have been and will be undertaking certain transformation initiative which are designed to reduce cost streamline and modernize distribution and customer service remove redundancy and simplify and improve process and support function our focus is on supporting added customer value with an improved customer experience we intend for these efficiency to enable increased investment in our strategic area of focus which consist of improving broadband connectivity for example fiber and developing software based entertainment such hbo max and utilizing warnermedia storytelling legacy to engage consumer and gain insight across multiple distribution point we also expect these initiative to drive efficiency and improved margin if we do not successfully manage and execute these initiative or if they are inadequate or ineffective we may fail to meet our financial goal and achieve anticipated benefit improvement may be delayed not sustained or not realized and our business operation and competitive position could be adversely affected inc dollar in million except per share amountsif our effort to attract and retain subscriber to our hbo max platform and to develop compelling choice are not successful our business will be adversely affected hbo max future success is subject to inherent uncertainty our ability to continue to attract subscriber to the hbo max platform will depend in part on our ability to consistently provide subscriber with compelling content choice well quality experience for selecting and viewing those content choice furthermore the relative service level content offering promotion and pricing and related feature of competitor to hbo max may adversely impact our ability to attract and retain subscriber if consumer do not perceive our offering to be of value including if we introduce new or adjust existing feature adjust pricing or offering terminate or modify promotional or trial period offering experience technical issue or change the mix of content in manner that is not favorably received by them we may not be able to attract and retain subscriber in addition many subscriber to these type of offering originate from word of mouth advertising from then existing subscriber if our effort to satisfy subscriber are not successful including because we terminate or modify promotional or trial period offering or because of technical issue with the platform we may not be able to attract or retain subscriber and result our ability to maintain and or grow our business will be adversely affected if subscriber cancel or decide to not continue subscription for any reason including perception that they do not use it sufficiently the need to cut household expense unsatisfactory availability of content promotion or trial period offer expire or are modified competitive service or promotion provide better value or experience and customer service or technical issue are not satisfactorily resolved our business will be adversely affected we must continually add new subscriber both to replace canceled subscriber and to grow our business if we do not grow expected given in particular that significant portion of our content cost are committed and contracted over several year based on minimum subscriber delivery level we may not be able to adjust our expenditure or increase our per subscriber revenue commensurate with the lowered growth rate such that our margin liquidity and result of operation may be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully compete with competitor in retaining and attracting new subscriber our business will be adversely affected further if excessive number of subscriber do cancel we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenditure or offer significantly more generous promotion to replace these subscriber with new subscriber unfavorable litigation or governmental investigation result could require to pay significant amount or lead to onerous operating procedure we are subject to number of lawsuit both in the united state and in foreign country including at any particular time

adverse effect on our operation and financial condition inc dollar in million except per share amountsincreases in our debt level to fund spectrum purchase or other strategic decision could adversely affect our ability to finance future debt at attractive rate and reduce our ability to respond to competition and adverse economic trend we have incurred debt to fund significant acquisition well spectrum purchase needed to compete in our industry while we believe such decision were prudent and necessary to take advantage of both growth opportunity and respond to industry development we did experience credit rating downgrade from historical level bank and potential purchaser of our publicly traded debt may decide that these strategic decision and similar action we may take in the future well expected trend in the industry will continue to increase the risk of investing in our debt and may demand higher rate of interest impose restrictive covenant or otherwise limit the amount of

dollar in million except per share amountsaccounting policy and standard critical accounting policy and estimate because of the size of the financial statement line item they relate to or the extent of judgment required by our management some of our accounting policy and estimate have more significant impact on our consolidated financial statement than others the following policy are presented in the order in which the topic appear in our consolidated statement of income pension and postretirement benefit our actuarial estimate of retiree benefit expense and the associated significant weighted average assumption are discussed in note our assumed weighted average discount rate for pension and postretirement benefit of and respectively at december reflect the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow for the obligation these bond had an average rating of at least or aa by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization denominated in dollar and neither callable convertible nor index linked for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december we increased our pension discount rate by resulting in decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of and increased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of our expected long term rate of return is on pension plan asset and on postretirement plan asset for and for our expected return on plan asset is calculated using the actual fair value of plan asset if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that decrease in the expected long term rate of return would cause combined pension and postretirement cost to increase which under our accounting policy would be adjusted to actual return in the current year part of our fourth quarter remeasurement of our retiree benefit plan we recognize gain and loss on pension and postretirement plan asset and obligation immediately in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income these gain and loss are generally measured annually of december and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumption the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future year see note for additional discussion regarding our assumption depreciation our depreciation of asset including use of composite group depreciation for certain subsidiary and estimate of useful life is described in note and if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that one year increase in the useful life of our plant in service would have resulted in decrease of approximately in our depreciation expense and that one year decrease would have resulted in an increase of approximately in our depreciation expense see note and for depreciation and amortization expense applicable to property plant and equipment including our finance lease right of use asset asset valuation and impairmentsgoodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are not amortized but tested at least annually on october for impairment for impairment testing we estimate fair value using model that predominantly rely on the expected cash flow to be derived from the reporting unit or use of the asset long lived

limited to subscriber count revenue from subscription advertising and content revenue per user capital investment and acquisition cost per subscriber production and content cost and ongoing operating cost we based our assumption on combination of our historical result trend business plan and marketplace participant data annual goodwill testinggoodwill is tested on reporting unit basis by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to it book value if the fair value exceeds the book value then no impairment is measured we estimate fair value using an income approach also known discounted cash flow model and market multiple approach the income approach utilizes our future cash flow projection with perpetuity value discounted at an appropriate weighted average cost of capital

january we updated our reporting unit to reflect change in how warnermedia an integrated content organization that distributes across various platform is managed and evaluated with this operational change the reporting unit is deemed to be the operating segment the previous reporting unit turner home box office warner bros and xandr and the new warnermedia reporting unit were tested for goodwill impairment on january for which there wa no impairment identified of october the calculated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded their book value in all circumstance however the warnermedia segment fair value exceeded it book value by le than with increased investment in content and distribution expense affecting fair value for all reporting unit if either the projected rate of long term growth of cash flow or revenue declined by or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by the fair value would still be higher than the book value of the goodwill in the event of drop in the fair value of the reporting unit the fair value still would have exceeded the book value of the reporting unit for the warnermedia reporting unit of october if the projected rate of longer term growth of cash flow or revenue declined by or if the weighted average cost of capital increased by it would have resulted in impairment of the goodwill wireless licensesthe fair value of wireless license is assessed using discounted cash flow model the greenfield approach and qualitative collaborative market approach based on auction price depending upon auction activity the greenfield approach assumes company initially owns only the wireless license and make investment required to build an operation comparable to current use these license are tested annually for impairment on an aggregated basis consistent with their use on national scope for the united state for impairment testing we assume subscriber and revenue growth will trend up to projected level with long term growth rate reflecting expected long term inflation trend we assume churn rate will initially exceed our current experience but decline to rate that are in line with industry leading churn we used discount rate of based on the optimal long term capital structure of market participant and it associated cost of debt and equity for the license to calculate the present value of the projected cash flow if either the projected rate of long term growth of cash flow or revenue declined by or if the discount rate increased by the fair value of these wireless license would still be higher than the book value of the license the fair value of these wireless license exceeded their book value by more than other finite lived intangiblescustomer relationship license in mexico and other finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the book value may not be recoverable over their remaining life for this analysis we compare the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset to it book value when the asset book value exceeds undiscounted future cash flow an impairment is recorded to reduce the book value of the asset to it estimated fair value see note and vrio businessin the second quarter of we classified the vrio disposal group held for sale and reported the disposal group at fair value le cost to sell which resulted in

return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow for the obligation in recent year the discount rate have been increasingly volatile and on average have been lower than in historical period lower discount rate used to measure our pension and postretirement plan result in

most of our foreign denominated long term debt ha been swapped from fixed rate or floating rate foreign currency to fixed rate dollar at issuance through cross currency swap removing interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk associated with the underlying interest and principal payment likewise periodically we enter into interest rate lock to partially hedge the risk of increase in the benchmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed rate debt we expect gain or loss in our cross currency swap and interest rate lock to offset the loss and

recorded on discounted basis if the license agreement are long term when the cost of the programming is reasonably determined ii the programming material ha been accepted in accordance with the term of the agreement iii the programming is available for it first showing or telecast and iv the license period ha commenced there are variation in the amortization method of these right depending on whether the network is advertising supported tnt and tb or not advertising supported hbo and turner classic movie for the advertising supported network our general policy is to amortize each program cost on straight line basis or per play basis if greater over it license period in circumstance where the initial airing of the program ha more value than subsequent airing an accelerated method of amortization is used the accelerated amortization upon the first airing versus subsequent airing is determined based on study of historical and estimated future advertising sale for similar programming for right fee paid for sport programming arrangement such right fee are amortized using revenue forecast model in which the right fee are amortized using the ratio of current period advertising revenue to total estimated remaining advertising revenue over the term of the arrangement for premium pay television streaming and over the top ott service that are not advertising supported each licensed program cost are amortized on straight line basis over it license period or estimated period of use beginning with the month of initial exhibition when we have the right to exhibit feature theatrical programming in multiple window over number of year historical audience viewership is used the basis for determining the amount of programming amortization attributable to each window inc dollar in million except per share amountslicensed programming inventory is carried at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value for network that generate both advertising and subscription revenue the net realizable value of unamortized programming cost is generally evaluated based on the network programming taken whole in assessing whether the programming inventory for particular advertising supported network is impaired the net realizable value for all of the network programming inventory is determined based on projection of the network profitability this assessment would occur upon the occurrence of certain triggering event similarly for premium pay television streaming and ott service that are not advertising supported an evaluation of the fair value of unamortized programming cost is performed based on service licensed programming taken whole specifically the fair value for all premium pay television streaming and ott service licensed programming is determined based on projection of estimated subscription revenue le certain cost of delivering and distributing the licensed programming change in management intended usage of specific program such decision to no longer exhibit that program and forgo the use of the right associated with the program license result in reassessment of that program fair value which could result in an impairment see

amount of participation and residual to be recognized broadcast programming and operation expense for given film or television series in particular period are determined using the film forecast computation method under this method the amortization of capitalized cost and the accrual of participation and residual are based on the proportion of the film or television program revenue recognized for such period to the film or television program estimated remaining ultimate revenue the total revenue to be received throughout film or television program life cycle the process of estimating film ultimate revenue requires to make series of judgment related to future revenue generating activity associated with particular film we estimate the ultimate revenue le additional cost to be incurred including exploitation and participation cost in order to determine whether the value of film or television series is impaired and requires an immediate write off of unrecoverable film and television production cost to the extent that the ultimate revenue are adjusted the resulting gross margin reported on the exploitation of that film or television series in period is also adjusted see note prior to the theatrical release of film our estimate are based on factor such the historical performance of similar film the star power of the lead actor the rating and genre of the film pre release market research including test market screening international distribution plan and the expected number of theater in which the film will be released in the absence of revenue directly related to the

not exceed ten year from the initial release of motion picture or from the date of delivery of the first episode of an episodic television series estimate were updated based on information available during the film production and upon release the actual result of each film for film or television program predominantly monetized part of film or television program group the amount of capitalized

the film or television program is exhibited or exploited property plant and equipment property plant and equipment is stated at cost except for asset acquired using acquisition accounting which are initially recorded at fair value see note the cost of addition and substantial improvement to property plant and equipment is capitalized and includes internal compensation cost for these project the

the use and eventual disposition of the asset see note the liability for the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred if reasonable estimate of fair value can be made in period subsequent to initial measurement we recognize period to period change in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revision to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate the increase in the carrying value of the associated long lived asset is depreciated over the corresponding estimated economic life software cost we capitalize certain

tiered fair value hierarchy based on the reliability of the input used to determine fair value level refers to fair value determined based on quoted price in active market for identical asset level refers to fair value estimated using significant other observable input and level includes fair value estimated using significant unobservable input the level of an asset or liability within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement our valuation technique maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input the valuation methodology described above may produce fair value calculation that may not be indicative of future net realizable value or reflective of future fair value we believe our valuation method are appropriate and consistent with other market participant the use of different methodology or assumption to determine the fair value of certain financial instrument could result in different fair value measurement at the reporting date there have been no change in the methodology used since december long term debt and other financial instrumentsthe carrying amount and

for pension benefit and for postretirement benefit average interest crediting rate for cash balance pension program relate only to the cash balance portion of total pension benefit increase in the weighted average interest crediting rate would increase the pension benefit obligation by we recognize gain and loss on pension and postretirement plan asset and obligation immediately in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of income these gain and loss are generally measured annually of december and accordingly will normally be recorded during the fourth quarter unless an earlier remeasurement is required should actual experience differ from actuarial assumption the projected pension benefit obligation and net pension cost and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement benefit cost would be affected in future year discount rate our assumed weighted average discount rate for pension and postretirement benefit of and respectively at december reflects the hypothetical rate at which the projected benefit obligation could be effectively settled or paid out to participant we determined our discount rate based on range of factor including yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date and corresponding to the related expected duration of future cash outflow these bond had an average rating of at least or aa by the nationally recognized statistical rating organization denominated in dollar and neither callable convertible nor index linked for the year ended december when compared to the year ended december we increased our pension discount rate by resulting in decrease in our pension plan benefit obligation of and increased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in decrease in our postretirement benefit obligation of for the year ended december we decreased our pension discount rate by resulting in an increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of and decreased our postretirement discount rate by resulting in an increase in our postretirement benefit obligation of we utilize full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefit under this approach we apply discounting using individual spot rate from yield curve composed of the rate of return on several hundred high quality fixed income corporate bond available at the measurement date these spot rate align to each of the projected benefit obligation and service cost cash flow the service cost component relates to the active participant in the plan so the relevant cash flow on which to apply the yield curve are considerably longer in duration on average than the total projected benefit obligation cash flow which also include benefit payment to retiree interest cost is computed by multiplying each spot rate by the corresponding discounted projected benefit obligation cash flow the full yield curve approach reduces any actuarial gain and loss based upon interest rate expectation built in gain in interest cost in an upward sloping yield curve scenario or gain and loss merely resulting from the timing and magnitude of cash outflow associated with our benefit obligation neither the annual measurement of our total benefit obligation nor annual net benefit cost is affected by the full yield curve approach inc dollar in million except per share amountsexpected long term rate of return in our expected long term rate of return is on pension plan asset and on postretirement plan asset our long term rate of return reflect the average rate of earnings expected on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the projected benefit obligation in setting the long term assumed rate of return management considers capital market future expectation the asset mix of the plan investment and average historical asset return actual long term return can in relatively stable market also serve factor in determining future expectation we consider many factor that include but are not limited to historical return on plan asset current market information on long term return long term bond rate and current and target asset allocation between asset category the target asset allocation is determined based on consultation with external investment adviser if all other factor were to remain unchanged we expect that decrease in the expected long term rate of return would cause combined pension and postretirement cost to increase however any difference in the rate and actual return will be included with the actuarial gain or loss recorded in the fourth quarter when our plan are remeasured composite rate of compensation increase our expected composite rate of compensation increase cost of in and reflects the long term average rate of salary increase healthcare cost trend our healthcare cost trend assumption are developed based on historical cost data the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trend based on our assessment of expectation of healthcare industry inflation our assumed annual healthcare prescription drug cost trend and medical cost trend for eligible participant will increase from an annual and ultimate trend rate of to an annual and

pension plan are maintained to meet erisa requirement any plan contribution determined by erisa regulation are made to pension trust for the benefit of plan participant we do not have significant erisa required contribution to our pension plan for we maintain veba trust to partially fund postretirement benefit however there are no erisa or regulatory requirement that these postretirement benefit plan be funded annually we made discretionary contribution of in december and in december to our postretirement plan the principal investment objective are to ensure the availability of fund
