reserve bank of australia regulates interchange reimbursement rate and the governing authority in india regulate the merchant discount rate in may the eu published regulation on interchange fee for card based payment transaction and interchange cap for intra regional debit and credit card transaction will take effect on december see item risk factor additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rate may reduce our transaction volume and harm our overall business and item financial statement and supplementary data note legal matter included elsewhere in this report network exclusivity and routing the dodd frank act limit the issuer and our ability to impose rule for or choose various form of network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid network market segment other jurisdiction have enacted similar limitation consumer financial protection bureau the dodd frank act created an independent consumer financial protection bureau cfpb with responsibility for most federal consumer protection law in the area of financial service and new authority with respect to consumer protection issue including those pertaining to to some extent the cfpb future action may make payment card or product transaction generally le attractive to issuer acquirer consumer and merchant by regulating disclosure payment card practice fee routing and other matter with respect to credit debit and prepaid card no surcharge rule we have historically implemented rule that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using their visa branded card or payment product instead of other mean part of the settlement reached in the interchange multidistrict litigation however visa ha agreed to modify our rule to permit surcharging on credit transaction under certain circumstance see item financial statement and supplementary data note legal matter included elsewhere in this report number of state well certain jurisdiction outside

information security aspect of our operation or business are subject to privacy and data protection law in the and other jurisdiction globally in accordance with governing law we devote substantial resource to maintain and continually refine our information security program in order to safeguard account holder information and under certain circumstance to provide account holder notification in the event of security breach in addition the federal financial institution examination council periodically review aspect of our operation in the to examine our compliance with data integrity security and operational requirement and standard well other requirement applicable to because of our role service provider to financial institution regulator around the globe are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposal concerning privacy and data protection due to the evolving nature and handling of data the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection law around the globe are often uncertain and in state of flux anti money laundering anti terrorism and sanctioned country we are subject to anti money laundering law and regulation including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act in addition we are also subject to the economic and trade sanction program administered by the department of the treasury office of foreign asset control ofac that prohibit or restrict dealing with certain country their government and in certain circumstance their national well with specifically designated individual and entity such narcotic trafficker terrorist and terrorist organization we have policy procedure system and control designed to identify and address potentially impermissible transaction government imposed market participation influence and restriction our market reach remains limited by certain government influence on their domestic payment competition and or their protection of domestic issuer or payment network processor regulator in an increasing number of country around the world have received statutory authority to regulate certain aspect of the payment system in these country regulation of internet mobile payment and other type of transaction many jurisdiction have adopted or are considering regulation that require payment system participant including our financial institution client and to monitor identify filter restrict or take other specific action with regard to certain type of payment transaction for example federal legislation ha been enacted that requires payment system operator to implement system that allows issuer to identify internet gambling transaction so they have the option to decline such transaction request state government have been interested in the potential blocking of internet interstate sale of cigarette and alcohol or the collection of state and local sale tax on such internet purchase implementing such system increase cost for our financial institution client and and may reduce merchant acceptance of visa branded card and payment product for these purchase the congress continues to consider regulatory initiative in the area of internet prescription drug purchase copyright and trademark infringement and privacy among others that could impose additional compliance burden on our financial institution client and some state are considering variety of similar legislation various regulatory agency also continue to examine wide variety of issue including mobile payment transaction money transfer identity theft account management guideline privacy disclosure rule security and marketing that could affect our financial institution client directly these new requirement and development may affect our financial institution client ability to offer existing product and service extend credit via payment card and product and offer new type of payment program which could decrease our transaction volume and revenue available informationwe are subject to the

relation website in addition to following sec of contentsfilings and publicly available conference call the information contained on our corporate website including the information contained on our investor relation website is not incorporated by reference into this report or any other report filed with or furnished to the sec item risk factor regulatory risksadditional regulation of interchange reimbursement rate may reduce our transaction volume and harm our overall business we generally do not receive any revenue related to interchange reimbursement fee in purchase transaction those fee are paid by the acquirer to the issuer they are however factor on which we compete with other payment provider and are therefore an important determinant of the volume of transaction we process consequently change to these fee can substantially affect our revenue and overall payment volume we have historically set default interchange reimbursement rate in the and many other geography interchange reimbursement rate our operating rule and related practice have become subject to continued or increased government regulation globally and regulatory authority and central bank in number of jurisdiction have reviewed or are reviewing these rate and practice when we can not set default interchange reimbursement rate at optimal level issuer and acquirer may find our payment system le attractive it may increase the attractiveness of other payment system like competitor closed loop payment system with direct connection to merchant and consumer in addition result of such regulation we believe some issuer are charging new or higher fee to consumer in certain instance some acquirer elect to charge higher discount rate to merchant regardless of the visa interchange reimbursement rate causing merchant not to accept visa branded card or payment product or to steer account holder to alternate payment system or form of payment in addition some issuer and acquirer have obtained and may continue to obtain incentive from and reduction in the fee that we charge in an effort to reduce the expense of their card program for these reason additional regulation of interchange reimbursement rate may make visa branded card and payment product le desirable reduce our overall transaction volume and harm our overall business we are subject to regulation that prohibit from contracting with client or requiring to use only our network or that deny them the option of selecting only our network in order to provide account holder consistent experience and transparency into visanet we promote certain practice to ensure that visa branded card are processed over our network we have historically agreement with some issuer under which they agree to issue certain payment card that use only the visa network or receive incentive if they do so in addition certain issuer of some product have historically chosen to include only our network we refer to these various practice network exclusivity in addition certain network or issuer rule or practice may be viewed limiting the routing option of merchant when multiple debit network co reside on visa debit card for example the visa rule require that all authorization clearance and settlement of international transaction must be done through visanet these are commonly referred to routing rule the dodd frank act already limit our and issuer ability to adopt network exclusivity and preferred routing in the debit area additional legislation or regulation like the dodd frank act in the and elsewhere could materially decrease the number of transaction we process in order to retain transaction volume we may reduce the fee we charge to issuer or acquirer or increase the payment and other incentive we provide to issuer acquirer or merchant any of these outcome could harm our overall business the dodd frank act and other regulation and development arising from the dodd frank act may continue to harm our overall business of october in accordance with the dodd frank act the federal reserve capped the maximum debit interchange reimbursement rate charged by large financial institution at twenty one cent plus five basis point with possible fraud adjustment to an additional one cent this amounted to significant reduction in the average system wide fee previously charged the federal reserve also issued regulation requiring issuer to make at least two unaffiliated network available for processing debit transaction on each debit card the rule of contentsalso prohibit and issuer from restricting merchant ability to direct the routing of electronic debit transaction over any of the network that an issuer ha enabled to process those transaction these regulation have adversely affected our debit business and associated revenue by creating negative pressure on our pricing reduced the volume and number of debit payment we process and diminished associated revenue although we believe we have absorbed the principal impact of the october regulation our business could continue to be affected including if the federal reserve issue new or revised regulation negative pressure have arisen through various channel other debit network may become more aggressive in offering merchant cost reduction to win routing preference which in turn put more pressure on the business term offered by visa number of our client obtained fee reduction or increased incentive from to offset their own lost revenue some client elected to issue fewer card enabled with visa affiliated network or reduced the number of debit card they issued and investment they made in marketing and reward program while others imposed new or higher fee on debit card or demand deposit account relationship many merchant have used the routing regulation to redirect transaction or steer account holder to other debit network based on lower cost or other factor other client and merchant are likely to take similar action in the future some element of the dodd frank act lack definition and create the potential for network to pursue different strategy subject to their interpretation of the rule our interpretation may result in pursuit of strategy that may be le effective than those of our competitor overall the regulation and development arising from the dodd frank act could harm our overall business new law or regulation in one jurisdiction or of one product offering may lead to new law or regulation in other jurisdiction or of other product offering regulator around the world increasingly note each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another the dodd frank act and the european union interchange regulation are development with such potential see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report similarly new law and regulation involving one product offering may cause lawmaker there to extend the regulation to other product offering for example regulation affecting debit payment could eventually spread to credit payment the risk created by new law or regulation have the potential to be replicated and to negatively affect our business in another region or in other product offering we may face differing rule and regulation in matter like interchange reimbursement rate preferred routing domestic processing requirement currency conversion point of sale transaction rule and practice privacy and data use or protection result the visa rule may differ from country to country or by product offering if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty rapidly adjusting our product offering service and fee and other important aspect of our business in the various region in addition adverse development regulation and litigation with respect to our industry or another industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation and result in greater regulatory and legislative scrutiny or litigation against any of these factor could harm our overall business government action may prevent from competing effectively against provider of domestic payment service in certain country government in some country provide resource to or protection for their domestic payment card network brand and processor these government may impose regulatory requirement that favor domestic provider or that mandate domestic payment processing be done entirely in that country in china for example unionpay continues to enjoy advantage over international network remains the sole processor of domestic transaction and operates the sole domestic acceptance mark though the chinese state council ha announced that international scheme such visa would be able to participate in the domestic market and be eligible to apply for license to operate bank card clearing institution bcci in china legislation and implementation guideline for bcci have yet to be published and finalized meanwhile in russia national payment legislation ha effectively prevented visa from processing in the domestic market and ha mandated that visa migrate it domestic processing business to the state owned nspk which is the only entity allowed to process domestically national law that mandate domestic processing may increase our cost and decrease the number of visa branded card issued or processed in those region these action could impede from utilizing our global processing capability for our financial institution client in those country and substantially restrict our activity there and in of contentsother country that may adopt similar practice these action could also force to leave country we presently have activity and keep from entering new market although we are trying to effect change in these country we may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to operate our business maintain or increase our revenue globally and extend our global brand we are subject to regulation in the area of consumer privacy and data use and security privacy data use and security continue to receive heightened legislative and regulatory focus in the and elsewhere for example in many jurisdiction consumer must be notified in the event of data breach and those jurisdiction that have these law are continuing to increase the circumstance and the breadth of these notice these law and regulation can impact the way we use and handle data operate our product and service and even impact our ability to offer product or service our failure or the failure of our client to comply with these law and regulation could result in fine sanction litigation and damage to our global reputation and our brand these law and regulation may increase visa and our client cost decrease the number of visa branded card our client issue and decrease our payment volume and revenue evolving and increased global regulatory focus on the payment industry may result in costly new compliance burden on our client and on regulation of the payment industry ha evolved and increased significantly example include data protection and information security aspect of our operation and business are subject to privacy and data protection regulation in the and elsewhere our financial institution client around the globe are subject to similar requirement under privacy law and bank regulatory regime for example of september russia amended it personal data law to require personal data operator to store personal information of russian citizen in database located in russia in addition many state have enacted legislation requiring consumer notification in the event of security breach regulatory and sanction compliance we are subject to anti money laundering law and regulation including the bank secrecy act and the patriot act in addition we are subject to economic and trade sanction program administered by ofac an increase in the number of ofac sanction may affect the issuance acceptance reputation and revenue associated with visa branded card some of our client located outside of the may not be subject to these same law regulation and sanction and result may initiate transaction that are permissible in their country but that may not be permissible were the transaction to take place in the regulation of the price of credit many jurisdiction in which visa branded card are used have regulation that could increase the cost of card issuance or decrease the flexibility of issuer to charge market based interest rate and fee on credit card account in the these include regulation issued under the truth in lending act of amended by the credit card act of increased consumer financial protection bureau scrutiny regulatory change by the cfpb that impose new requirement on or restrict the term under which financial product can be offered could increase our client cost and decrease the number of visa branded payment card our client issue the cfpb also ha supervisory and independent examination authority well enforcement authority over certain financial institution their service provider and other entity which could include due to our processing of credit debit and prepaid transaction increased central bank oversight several central bank and similar regulatory body around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payment industry and in some case have already designated certain payment system systemically important payment system or critical infrastructure for example visa europe wa recently designated systematically important by the bank of england any such oversight may lead to additional regulation by central bank and other government regulator these could include new settlement procedure cyber security requirement or other policy or operational rule to address settlement and operational risk increased central bank oversight could also include new criterion for financial institution client participation and merchant or other non bank access to our payment system for example in china draft cyber security legislation may prevent company like visa from bringing international best practice standard for fraud and risk management when the market is open of content safety and soundness regulation banking regulation enacted in the and elsewhere may make some financial institution le likely to become an issuer of visa branded card because they may be subject to increased risk management or higher capital requirement regulation of internet and mobile transaction legislation in various jurisdiction may make it le desirable or more costly to complete internet transaction using visa branded card by affecting the legality of those transaction the law that govern the transaction their taxation or the allocation of various intellectual property right in addition new mobile regulatory requirement could impact our business practice for instance in china where new regulation may prevent company like visa from introducing new technology when the market open to them money transfer regulation we expand our product offering we may become subject to federal and state money transfer regulation international payment law and other existing new or evolving regulation which could increase our regulatory oversight and compliance cost complying with these and other regulation increase our cost and can reduce our revenue opportunity our program and policy are designed to comply with anti money laundering anti terrorism anti corruption and sanction regulation and other law and we continue to enhance them but regulation continue to evolve and regulatory oversight continues to increase we can not guarantee that our program and policy will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authority in the event our control should fail or we are found to be of compliance for other reason we could be subject to monetary damage civil and criminal money penalty litigation and damage to our global brand reputation the impact of such regulation on our client and on may increase compliance cost and reduce the volume of payment we process moreover such regulation can limit the type of product and service that we offer the country in which visa branded card are used and the type of account holder and merchant who can obtain or accept visa branded card thereby harming our overall business litigation risk our retrospective responsibility plan may not adequately insulate from the impact of settlement or final judgment our retrospective responsibility plan address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation which is described in note retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liability to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report the retrospective responsibility plan consists of several related mechanism to fund settlement or judgment in the covered litigation these include an escrow account funded with portion of the net proceeds of our ipo and any subsequent offering of our share of class common stock or deposit of cash into the escrow account in lieu of such offering they also include loss sharing agreement judgment sharing agreement and an omnibus agreement amended in addition our financial institution client are obligated to indemnify pursuant to visa inc certificate of incorporation and bylaw and in accordance with their membership agreement these mechanism are unique complicated and tiered and if we can not use one or more of them this could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow or even cause to become insolvent the principal remaining covered litigation involves interchange reimbursement rate see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report beginning in series of complaint the majority of which were styled class action were filed on behalf of merchant against mastercard and or other defendant including certain visa member financial institution we refer to this the interchange multidistrict litigation or mdl among other allegation the plaintiff alleged that visa setting of default interchange reimbursement rate violated federal antitrust law and in some case certain state unfair competition law the lawsuit were transferred to multidistrict litigation in the district court for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff in mdl seek damage for alleged overcharge in merchant discount rate well injunctive and other relief the consolidated class action complaint alleges that estimated damage will range in the ten of billion of dollar because these lawsuit were brought under the federal antitrust law any actual damage would be trebled the allocation of any monetary judgment or certain settlement among the defendant is governed by an omnibus agreement dated february and amended august and october see note retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liability to our consolidated financial statement of contentsincluded in item of this report visa portion of settlement or judgment covered by the omnibus agreement amended would be allocated in accordance with specified provision of our retrospective responsibility plan we signed settlement agreement in connection with mdl which included an agreement to pay approximately billion to the class plaintiff on january the court entered final judgment order approving the settlement from which number of objector have appealed the appeal are finally adjudicated no assurance can be provided that we will be able to resolve the class plaintiff claim contemplated by the settlement agreement number of merchant have filed opt out case in various federal district court all of the case filed in federal court have been either assigned to the judge presiding over mdl or have been transferred by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation for inclusion in mdl the court ha entered an order confirming that mdl includes all current and future action transferred to mdl by the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation or other order of any court for inclusion in coordinated or pretrial proceeding and ii all action filed in the eastern district of new york that arise out of operative fact alleged in the case subject to the transfer order of the judicial panel on multidistrict litigation case that are transferred to or otherwise included in mdl or that are brought after october by an opt out of the rule settlement class in mdl and arise out of fact or circumstance substantially similar to those alleged in mdl are covered litigation for purpose of the retrospective responsibility plan see note retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liability failure of our retrospective responsibility plan to insulate adequately from the impact of such settlement or judgment could result in material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow such failure could even cause to become insolvent the retrospective responsibility plan address only the covered litigation the plan generally doe not cover other pending litigation or any litigation that we may face in the future except for case that include claim for damage relating to the period prior to our ipo that are transferred to or otherwise included in the interchange multidistrict litigation or that are brought by rule opt out and arise out of fact or circumstance substantially similar to those alleged in mdl in addition non monetary settlement term and judgment in the covered litigation may require to modify the way we do business therefore even if our retrospective responsibility plan provides with adequate funding to satisfy our obligation with respect to monetary liability from settlement of and judgment in the covered litigation it will not insulate from the monetary impact of pending or future litigation described in note visa europe and note retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liability to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report on november the company and visa europe entered into transaction agreement pursuant to which the company agreed to acquire visa europe the closing is subject to various condition including regulatory approval and is expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of visa inc visa europe or their affiliate are or may become party to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rate in the visa europe territory part of the acquisition term the company ha obtained certain protection in respect of loss resulting from such existing and potential litigation through the preferred stock and the loss sharing agreement if claim are not covered by these transactional protection visa europe may have recourse under it membership document against member under the term of the existing indemnity arrangement other than in respect of certain claim relating to domestic multilateral interchange fee however similar to the retrospective responsibility plan failure of these protection to insulate adequately from the impact of settlement or judgment in the existing and potential litigation against visa inc visa europe or their affiliate could result in material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flow if we are found liable in other pending or future lawsuit we may have to pay substantial damage like many other large company we are defendant in number of civil action and investigation alleging violation of competition or antitrust law consumer protection law or intellectual property law among others example of such claim are described more fully in note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some lawsuit involve complex claim that are subject to substantial uncertainty and unspecified damage therefore we can not ascertain the probability of loss or estimate our liability accordingly we have not established allowance for such legal proceeding particularly in case involving merchant and consumer private plaintiff often seek class action certification in case against due to the size and scope of our business if we are unsuccessful in our defense against large class action lawsuit such the or canadian merchant class action lawsuit monetary damage could be of contentssignificant which could harm our financial condition see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report there may be limitation on our business or change to our business practice resulting from our litigation certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year because of litigation we may also have to change our business practice in response to pending or future litigation for example under the settlement agreement in the interchange multidistrict litigation we have agreed among other thing to permit merchant to add surcharge to credit transaction in certain circumstance see item financial statement and supplementary data note legal matter included elsewhere in this report additional surcharge to credit transaction could adversely impact consumer usage of visa branded payment product settlement of or judgment in pending and future litigation could force to limit the rate we set revise our rule about rate charged to consumer who use visa branded payment product or make other modification that could harm our overall business we may be subject to tax examination or dispute or change in the tax law we exercise significant judgment in calculating our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability although we believe our tax estimate are reasonable many factor may decrease their accuracy we are currently under examination by or in dispute with the internal revenue service and other tax authority and we may be subject to additional examination or dispute in the future relevant tax authority may disagree with our tax treatment of certain material item and thereby increase our tax liability failure to sustain our position in these matter could result in material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial position in addition change in existing law such recent proposal for fundamental and international tax reform may also increase our effective tax rate substantial increase in our tax payment could have material adverse effect on our financial result see also note income tax to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report we have limited right to enforce our framework agreement with visa europe which could expose to significant liability while we have entered into an agreement to acquire visa europe until the transaction close or if it fails to close our relationship is governed by the framework agreement in the event visa europe fails to meet it obligation under the framework agreement our remedy are limited we are unable to terminate the framework agreement even upon visa europe material uncured breach see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report under the framework agreement we may be required to indemnify visa europe for loss resulting from all claim outside it region arising from our or their action relating to the payment business this obligation applies even if neither we any of our related party or agent engaged in the action give rise to such claim the indemnity obligation could expose to significant liability for activity over which we have little or no control our retrospective responsibility plan would not cover these liability in our view pursuant to the framework agreement visa europe is obligated to indemnify visa inc and visa international service association visa international in connection with the european competition proceeding the pending european commission investigation and the filed or unfiled claim in the merchant litigation including payment of any fine or damage that may be imposed however visa europe ha informed of it view that it is not obligated to indemnify visa inc or visa international for these claim if visa europe continues in it refusal to indemnify and we can not enforce the indemnity we could be exposed to significant liability which would not be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report business risk we face intense pressure on client pricing pressure on client pricing pose challenge for our business in order to stay competitive we offer incentive to our client to increase payment volume enter new market segment and expand their visa branded card base these include up front cash payment fee discount credit performance based incentive marketing and other support payment we have continued to increase the use of incentive such up front cash payment and fee discount in many country including the in addition we offer incentive to certain merchant or acquirer to of contentswin routing preference in situation where our product co reside with other network and merchant have choice of network routing option the economic pressure on our client arising from the dodd frank act have also increased our use of incentive result the provision of certain product and service may be le profitable or become unprofitable which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profit if we continue to increase incentive to our client we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume increasing the amount of fee based service we provide or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current regulatory environment in addition we benefit from long term contract with certain client including those that are large contributor to our revenue continued pressure on our fee could prevent from maintaining such agreement in the future on the same or favorable term we may also have to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship or comply with regulation while we may implement cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those surrounding client incentive we may not be successful in our effort or they may not offset the decrease in our revenue we face intense competition in our industry the global payment industry is intensely competitive and result our payment program compete against all form of payment these include cash check electronic ecommerce virtual currency and mobile payment well traditional general purpose card network in addition our open loop payment network competes against other alternate payment system such closed loop payment system traditional or nontraditional competitor may put at competitive disadvantage by leveraging service or product in area in which we do not directly compete to win business in area where we do compete our client can reassess their commitment to at any time or develop their own competitive service the dodd frank act increased this competitive pressure the risk to maintaining or securing our client long term commitment to our product increased with the dodd frank act restriction on network exclusivity in the debit sector we do not have exclusivity with our largest client such jpmorgan chase and bank of america in certain circumstance our client may terminate these relationship on relatively short notice without significant early termination fee because significant portion of our operating revenue is concentrated among our largest client the loss of business from any of these client could have an adverse effect on the company see note enterprise wide disclosure and concentration of business to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report additionally some of our competitor may develop substantially better technology or have greater financial resource they may offer wider range of program product and service than we do including more innovative one they may use advertising and marketing strategy that are more effective than ours achieving broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance they may also develop better security solution or more favorable pricing arrangement certain of our competitor operate with different business model have different cost structure or participate selectively in different market segment they may ultimately prove more successful or more adaptable to new regulatory technological and other development in many case these competitor have the support of government mandate that prohibit limit or otherwise hinder our ability to compete for or otherwise secure transaction within those country and region we expect there to be change in the competitive landscape in the future for example competitor client and others may develop product that compete with impair or replace the value added service we provide to support our transaction processing party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position in the payment value chain we may be asked to develop or customize certain aspect of our payment service for use by our customer processor or other third party participant in the payment industry may merge form joint venture or enter into other business combination that strengthen their existing business proposition or create new competing payment service of content competition may increase from alternate type of payment service such mobile payment service ecommerce payment service and service that permit direct debit of consumer checking account or ach payment new player and intermediary in the payment value chain may redirect transaction or steer account holder away from our network or new service and technology that we develop may be impacted by industry wide solution and standard set by organization such the international organization for standardization american national standard institute well emvco related to emv chip payment technology cloud based payment tokenization or other technology our failure to compete effectively in light of any such development could harm our business and prospect for future growth disintermediation from the payment value chain could harm our business our position in the payment value chain is key to our business some of our competitor including american express discover private label card network virtual currency and certain alternate payment system operate closed loop payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer without any intermediary these competitor seek to derive competitive advantage from this business model regulatory action or initiative such the dodd frank act or the federal reserve faster payment effort may provide them with increased opportunity to do so in addition although other competitor are pursuing similar line of business or adopting similar commercial model they have not attracted the same level of legal or regulatory scrutiny of their pricing and business practice operator of multi party payment system such ours we also run the risk of disintermediation due to factor such emerging technology including mobile payment and by virtue of increasing bilateral agreement between entity that prefer not to use our payment network for processing payment for example merchant could process transaction directly with issuer or processor could process transaction directly with issuer and acquirer additional consolidation in the financial service industry could impact our revenue and harm our overall business additional consolidation in the financial service industry or the acquisition of one or more of our largest client by an institution with strong relationship with one of our competitor may reduce the overall number of our client this could result in the acquired financial institution visa business shifting to competitor resulting in substantial loss of business to our existing client may seek to obtain more favorable pricing agreement we may also be adversely affected by price compression should one of our client absorb another financial institution and qualify for higher volume based discount on the combined volume of the merged business pressure on the fee we charge our client caused by such consolidation could impact our revenue and harm our overall business merchant continued focus on the cost associated with payment card acceptance expose to additional risk we rely in part on merchant and their relationship with our client to maintain and expand the acceptance of visa branded payment card consolidation in the retail industry is producing group of larger merchant that is significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry some merchant have sought to reduce their cost associated with payment card acceptance by lobbying for new legislation and regulatory enforcement and by filing lawsuit if they continue we may face increased compliance and litigation expense additionally some merchant have pushed for change to the visa rule which govern visa acceptance at the point of sale including the ability to accept only certain type of visa branded card credit or debit and impose account holder surcharge if successful where applicable these effort could adversely impact consumer usage of visa branded payment product we also face competitive pressure on pricing we and our client negotiate pricing discount and other incentive arrangement with certain large merchant to increase acceptance and usage of visa branded payment card if merchant continue to consolidate we and our client may have to increase the incentive provided to certain large merchant some merchant also continue to invest in their own payment solution using both of contentstraditional and new technology platform example include closed loop payment system that are specific to single merchant or multi merchant solution like the merchant customer exchange which is designed for mobile platform utilizing alternative payment system and ha many merchant participant such program may offer unique or specialized benefit to consumer including discount or customized offer if merchant are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could harm our business we may not be able to grow or maintain our business due to certain financial institution or merchant exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor certain financial institution or merchant have longstanding exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue or accept payment card these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to conduct material amount of business with them in addition these financial institution or merchant may be more successful and may grow more quickly than our existing client or merchant which could put at competitive disadvantage and prevent from growing our business our success depends on our relationship with our financial institution client acquirer merchant account holder and other third party we depend and will continue to depend significantly on relationship with our financial institution client and on their relationship with account holder and merchant to support and to compete effectively for our program and service we do not issue card extend credit to account holder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to account holder using card that carry our brand each issuer determines these competitive card feature for their customer account holder however may associate these feature with our brand and if they are dissatisfied our business may be harmed result of the dodd frank act network exclusivity regulation we have engaged and will continue to engage in significantly more discussion with merchant acquirer and processor to provide incentive to promote routing preference and acceptance growth we already engage in many co branding effort in which we contract with merchant who directly receive incentive from these and other relationship become more prevalent and take on greater importance to our business our success will increasingly depend on our ability to sustain and grow these relationship outside the some government only permit local provider to complete domestic processing which prohibits from overseeing the end to end processing of the transaction therefore we depend on our close working relationship with our client or other third party processor in these region to effectively manage the processing of transaction involving visa branded card our inability to oversee the end to end processing for card carrying our brand in these country may put at competitive disadvantage by limiting our ability to ensure the quality of the service supporting our brand in addition we depend on third party and our financial institution client to provide various service associated with our payment network on our behalf and to the extent that such third party vendor or our financial institution client fail to perform or deliver adequate service our business and reputation could be impaired negative perception of our company in the marketplace may affect our brand and reputation our brand and reputation are key asset of our business the ability to attract and retain account holder and financial institution client to visa branded product depends highly upon the external perception of our company and our industry quality of service use and protection of account holder data regulatory compliance financial condition corporate responsibility and other factor negative perception or publicity particularly in light of the rapid widespread use of social medium channel could cause damage to our brand and reputation our business may also be affected by action taken by our client or other third party or by circumstance that are outside of our control our client and other third party may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our brand or that are inconsistent with our own business practice until we are able to complete the proposed acquisition of visa europe our limited control over the quality of service and promotion of our brand in europe could affect our brand and reputation globally while visa europe ha broad latitude to use our brand and technology within it region visa europe is not required to spend any minimum amount of money conducting research on brand performance promoting or maintaining the strength of our brand of content any negative perception of the arising from it political economic social or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand globally by associating visa with those position any of these factor could turn client and consumer away from our brand and product require to take on additional liability and cost result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny and harm our overall business we may continue to be affected by economic event in financial market around the world the current threat to global economic growth include geopolitical instability in brazil venezuela russia ukraine the middle east and other oil producing country which could affect oil price economic fragility in the eurozone and in the higher interest rate hurting the housing market sluggish job creation political discord spending cut and debt default while there continues to be some improvement in advanced economy emerging economy continue to suffer with slower growth consumer spending continues to be impacted from consumer debt level elevated housing inventory deflation change in saving rate continued equity market volatility decreased export activity lowered government spending and additional government intervention furthermore continued challenge in the credit environment bank instability downgrade of sovereign bank and commercial debt political issue affecting the handling of national debt and the uncertainty arising from new government policy could also impact our client merchant and account holder the fragility of the current situation would be exacerbated if additional negative economic development or crisis were to arise around the world these include default on government debt exhaustion of national economic stimulus package significant increase in oil price tax increase significant decline in the commercial real estate market and policy misstep most recently the economic situation in various country in europe have been particularly unstable arising from the real prospect of debt default if such default occur or if the measure taken to avert such default create their own instability economic turmoil is likely to result and the impact is likely to be global and highly significant the volatility of the current economic environment in advanced and emerging economy and the response by financial institution and government may create new risk or increase the impact of existing one these include the following depressed consumer and business confidence may continue to decrease account holder spending uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our client business may reduce the accuracy of our estimate of our revenue rebate incentive and realization of prepaid asset our client may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing budget or increase request for greater incentive or reduced fee from our client may decrease spending for optional or enhanced service which could reduce account holder desire to use these product our client may increase account holder fee cost recovery initiative or result of regulatory action decreasing their value proposition to consumer and reducing consumer desire to use our product government intervention or investment in our client may negatively affect our business in those region with our financial institution client tightening of credit availability could affect the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility the government inability to meet it obligation or possible further downgrade in the debt rating could adversely affect the liquidity of our investment substantial portion of which are in treasury and government security our client may default on their settlement obligation including for reason unrelated to payment card activity such mortgage loan commitment adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate could negatively affect the dollar value of our revenue and payment in foreign currency of content the current economic environment could lead some client to curtail or postpone near term investment in growing their card portfolio limit credit line modify fee and loyalty program or take other action that adversely affect the growth of our volume and revenue stream from these client decline in stock price or significant instability in the security market worldwide could cause consumer spending to decline materially any of these development could harm our overall business decline in non and cross border activity and in multi currency transaction could adversely affect our revenue and profitability we generate significant amount of our revenue from cross border transaction and our client pay fee in connection with them cross border transaction arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant some of these cross border transaction fee vary depending on the transaction currency and whether the transaction currency is different than the account holder billing currency provided to visa by his or her issuer additionally adverse change in exchange rate could reduce the number of cross border transaction which may harm our revenue in addition visa derives revenue from foreign currency exchange activity that result when our client settle transaction in different currency reduction in multi currency transaction may reduce the need for foreign currency exchange activity and adversely affect our revenue limitation or change in our ability to set foreign currency exchange rate for multi currency transaction result of regulation change to tax policy litigation competitive pressure reduced volatility in currency market or other reason may also adversely affect our revenue cross border travel may be adversely affected by global geopolitical economic social and other condition these include the threat of terrorism social or political instability natural disaster effect of climate change and outbreak of flu virus and other disease the need for conversion of currency decline cross border travel is impacted moreover if our financial institution client decide to change practice prohibit certain transaction or increase account holder fee associated with cross border transaction there could be decline in account holder spending because the value proposition to the consumer could be reduced transaction outside the represent an increasingly important part of our strategy which we hope will continue to grow however decline in non and cross border activity and multi currency transaction would decrease the number of cross border transaction we process and our revenue and profitability may be materially and adversely affected consequence we risk loss or insolvency if our client fail to fund settlement obligation for which we have provided indemnification we indemnify issuer and acquirer for any settlement loss they suffer due to the failure of another issuer or acquirer to fund it settlement obligation in accordance with the visa rule in certain instance we may indemnify issuer or acquirer even in situation in which transaction is not processed by our system this indemnification creates settlement risk for due to the difference in timing between the date of payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement while the amount of our indemnification obligation ha no limit our exposure under the indemnification is restricted to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time concurrent settlement failure involving more than one of our largest client several of our smaller client or systemic operational failure lasting more than single day could cause to exceed our available financial resource and impact our liquidity even if we have sufficient liquidity to cover settlement failure we may be unable to recover the amount of such payment this could expose to significant loss and harm our business see note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement included in item of this report some of our client are considered group member under the visa rule result some of these group member have elected to limit their responsibility for settlement loss arising from the failure of their constituent of contentsfinancial institution in exchange for managing their constituent financial institution in accordance with our credit risk policy to the extent that any settlement failure resulting from constituent financial institution exceeds the limit established by our credit risk policy we would have to absorb the cost of such settlement failure which could impact our liquidity the use of our product and our revenue could decline if we can not keep pace with rapid technological development to provide new and innovative payment program and service or comply with new law and regulation rapid significant technological change continue to confront the payment industry these include development in mobile and other proximity payment and acceptance ecommerce tokenization crypto currency and blockchain technology we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business in addition to our own initiative and innovation we work closely with third party including some potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology we expect that new service and technology applicable to the payment industry will continue to emerge these new service and technology may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our product and service in addition our ability to adopt new service and technology that we develop may be inhibited by industry wide standard new law and regulation resistance to change from client or merchant or third party intellectual property right if we are unable to develop new technology and adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard it could reduce the use of our product and harm our business the perception of our brand and our business could be harmed if our transaction processing system are disrupted or compromised processing or other technology malfunction fire natural disaster power loss disruption in long distance or local telecommunication access fraud military or political conflict terrorism effect of climate change or other catastrophic event may disrupt or compromise our transaction processing system in addition we may be susceptible to physical or computer based attack by terrorist or hacker due to our role in the global payment industry these concern about security are increased when information is transmitted over the internet and new technology are used to conduct financial transaction threat include cyberattacks such computer virus worm or other destructive or disruptive software process breakdown denial of service attack malicious social engineering or other malicious activity or any combination of the foregoing any of these incident could result in degradation or disruption of our service or damage to our property equipment and data they could also compromise data security if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded finally potential and actual attack could also result in increased cost both for recovery and for prevention against future attack additionally we rely on service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network if service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require for similar reason the failure could interrupt our service because of the centrality of our processing system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of our brand reliability and harm our business we may encounter account data breach cyberattacks or system failure involving card or other data processed stored or transmitted by third party or by we our client merchant and other service provider process store or transmit account holder and other information in connection with visa branded card and payment product in addition our client may use third party processor to process transaction generated by card carrying our brand the security measure and procedure we our client merchant and other service provider have in place to protect sensitive account holder data and other information may not be successful or sufficient to counter all data breach cyberattacks or system failure defending against even unsuccessful attempt to access our system could materially increase our cost failure or breach of the system processing storing or transmitting sensitive account holder data and other information could lead to fraudulent activity involving visa branded card reputational damage claim against and loss of client if we are sued in any lawsuit in connection with any data security breach we could be involved in protracted litigation if unsuccessful in defending such lawsuit we may have to pay damage or change our business practice or pricing structure any of which could harm our business in addition any reputational damage resulting from an account data breach cyberattacks or system failure at one or more of our client merchant or other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of visa branded card which could harm our payment volume revenue and future growth prospect finally breach may also subject visa to additional regulation or of contentsgovernmental or regulatory investigation which could result in significant compliance cost fine or enforcement action against the company or potential restriction imposed by regulator on our ability to process transaction fraudulent or other illegal activity involving visa branded card or payment product could harm our business criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture account holder and other information they use this information to conduct fraudulent transaction involving our payment product outsourcing and specialization of function within the payment system are increasing result more third party are involved in processing transaction using visa branded card or payment product rise in fraud level and other illegal activity involving visa branded card or payment product could lead to reputational damage to our brand this could reduce the use and acceptance of visa branded card and payment product or lead to greater regulation which could increase our compliance cost lower our payment volume and harm our overall business failure to maintain interoperability with visa europe system could damage the business and global perception of the visa brand until our proposed acquisition of visa europe close and for period of time afterwards while visa europe system are being integrated with visa system visa and visa europe will continue to maintain mostly separate authorization clearing and settlement system result we have to ensure that the two system can process every transaction involving both of our territory regardless of where it originates visa europe independent system operation could present challenge to our business due to increasing cost and difficulty in maintaining the interoperability of our respective system any inconsistency in the payment processing service and product between visa europe and could negatively affect account holder from visa europe using payment product in the country we serve or our account holder using payment product in visa europe region failure to authorize clear and settle inter territory transaction quickly and accurately could harm our business and impair the global perception of our brand structural and organizational risk we may experience added cost and challenge in operating our business in certain territory due to our relationship with visa europe until our proposed acquisition of visa europe close visa europe exclusive license of our trademark and technology under the framework agreement give little ability to control and oversee visa europe operation in it region if we want to change global rule or to implement certain change that may be viewed unfavorable to visa europe and it member visa europe is not required to implement the change unless we agree to pay for the associated implementation cost this may result in added cost and expense to our business furthermore the license granted under the framework agreement may raise licensing payment and associated tax treatment concern until our proposed acquisition of visa europe close visa europe may hinder our ability to acquire new business or to operate them effectively in it region if the acquired business ha operation in visa europe region visa europe may play significant part in influencing our ongoing operational decision and cost there finally visa europe may undertake operational and litigation strategy including but not limited to our ongoing litigation in the and our ongoing case with the european commission that may adversely impact our business and reputation globally we may be unable to address the opportunity and challenge presented by our strategy and the increasingly global dynamic competitive economic and regulatory environment for to remain organizationally effective we must effectively empower and deploy our management and operational resource and incorporate both global and local perspective into our decision and process if we fail to do so we may be unable to expand quickly and the result of our expansion may be unsatisfactory in addition if we are unable to make decision quickly ass our opportunity and risk execute our strategy and implement new governance managerial and organizational process needed we may not be successful in this increasingly global dynamic competitive economic and regulatory environment of contentswe may be unable to attract and retain key management and other key employee our employee particularly our key management are vital to our success our senior management team ha significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace we may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employee particularly if we do not offer employment term that are competitive with the rest of the market failure to attract motivate and retain highly qualified employee or failure to develop and implement viable succession plan could adversely affect our business and our future success future sale of our class common stock or the end of transfer restriction on our class common stock could result in dilution to holder of our existing class common stock the market price of our class common stock could fall result of many factor under our retrospective responsibility plan upon final resolution of our covered litigation all class common stock will become convertible into class common stock future offering of our class common stock or the end of the transfer restriction on our class common stock would increase the number of class common stock outstanding which could adversely affect the market price and dilute the voting power of our existing class common stock likewise if we complete the proposed acquisition of visa europe and issue the preferred share similar impact on market price and dilution to our existing class common stock could occur upon conversion of the preferred share into class common share the market price of our class common stock may also suffer from the perception that such an increase in the number of class common stock outstanding could occur in the future if fund are released from escrow after the resolution of the litigation covered by our retrospective responsibility plan the value of our class common stock will be diluted under our retrospective responsibility plan fund still in the escrow account after the resolution of all covered litigation will be released back to at that time each share of class common stock will become convertible into share of class common stock benefiting the holder of class common stock this in turn will result in dilution of the interest of holder of class common stock the amount of fund released and the market price of our class common stock will determine the extent of the dilution holder of our class and common stock may have different interest than our holder of our class common stock concerning certain significant transaction although their voting right are limited holder of our class and common stock can vote on certain significant transaction these include proposed consolidation or merger decision to exit our core payment business and any other vote required under delaware law the holder of these share may not have the same incentive to approve corporate action that may be favorable to the holder of class common stock and their interest may otherwise conflict with holder of class common stock likewise if we complete the proposed acquisition of visa europe and issue the preferred share similar dynamic may occur with the holder of the preferred share anti takeover provision in our governing document and under delaware law could delay or prevent takeover attempt or change in control provision contained in our current certificate of incorporation in our current bylaw and under delaware law could delay or prevent merger or acquisition that our stockholder may consider favorable for instance except for limited exception no person may beneficially own more than of our class common stock or of our total outstanding common stock on an converted basis unless our board of director approves the acquisition of such share in advance in addition except for common stock previously issued in connection with our reorganization to visa member defined in our current certificate of

dividend is declared or paid an equivalent amount must be paid on each class or series of our common stock and on the preferred share we are obligated to issue if we complete our proposed acquisition of visa europe of contentsacquisitions strategic investment and entry into new business could disrupt our business although we may continue to make strategic acquisition or investment in complementary business product or technology we may be unable to successfully finance partner with or integrate them such transaction including our anticipated acquisition of visa europe would present significant challenge and risk in case where strategic acquisition or investment are not successfully implemented or completed our financial condition or result of operation could be negatively impacted we may incur substantial debt for strategic acquisition or investment which could adversely impact our credit rating achieving the benefit of an acquisition is also dependent upon efficiently integrating the acquired business and system into our existing operation successfully managing new risk associated with the acquired business and achieving expected synergy any of which we may be unable to achieve on timely basis or at all until our acquisition of visa europe is completed we are subject to the term of the exclusive license granted to visa europe in most acquisition and major investment that involve country in visa europe territory which impact our ability to expand or conduct business in those region regulatory constraint particularly competition regulation may also affect the extent to which we can maximize the value of our acquisition or investment acquisition outside the may present unique challenge or increase our exposure to risk associated with foreign operation including foreign currency risk and the risk of complying with foreign regulation furthermore the integration of any acquisition or investment will take time and resource from our core business and may disrupt our operation we may spend time and money on acquisition or investment that do not increase our revenue although we periodically evaluate potential acquisition of and investment in business product and technology and anticipate continuing to make these evaluation we can not guarantee that they will be successful with the evolution of technology and the opening of new market segment we may choose to participate in area in which we have not engaged in the past either through acquisition or through organic development these include digital ecommerce loyalty service and mobile payment our recent entry into these business requires additional resource and present an additional degree of risk which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation risk relating to our proposed acquisition of visa europewe may not be able to complete the acquisition of visa europe on the term currently contemplated or at all on november we announced definitive agreement to acquire visa europe ltd we and visa europe have agreed to use all reasonable effort to take all action reasonably necessary to complete the acquisition there is no assurance however that the acquisition will ultimately be completed the obligation of the party to complete the acquisition are subject to various condition these condition include among others receipt of necessary regulatory approval absence of any material adverse effect determined under the definitive transaction documentation on visa europe or the company since september absence of legal restraint that prohibit the closing of the acquisition the loss sharing agreement remaining in full force and effect and the litigation management deed having been fully executed and remaining in full force and effect compliance by each party in all material respect with it obligation under the acquisition agreement and visa europe holding the full power and authority to effect the transaction the acquisition agreement may be terminated by or visa europe subject to specified exception if the acquisition is not completed by august or if legal restraint that prohibit the closing have become final and non appealable of contentsif we fail to complete the acquisition visa europe would continue to have the right to require to purchase all outstanding capital stock from visa europe member under the term of the put option it existed prior to it amendment in connection with the proposed acquisition given current economic condition the purchase price under the term of the put option would likely be in excess of billion we may not have the resource to fund the purchase price particularly if the reason we failed to complete the acquisition wa due to our inability to raise debt financing financing the acquisition of visa europe expose to risk to finance the visa europe acquisition we expect to issue senior unsecured debt in an amount ranging between and billion in the first half of fiscal with maturity ranging between two and year depending on market condition we can not predict whether we will be able to issue this debt on favorable term in this timeframe or at all if we are unable to issue this debt on favorable term the cost to of financing the acquisition may be higher than we currently expect moreover although we currently anticipate that the issuance of this debt will not adversely impact our credit rating there can be no assurance that one or more credit rating agency will not lower our credit rating particularly if there is perceived deterioration in our business or financial prospect any lowering of our credit rating or in connection with the issuance of this debt would be expected to increase the cost of financing the acquisition if we are unable to issue this debt and are not able to obtain alternative financing on term that are acceptable to we may be unable to complete the acquisition which could expose to liability to visa europe and it shareholder if we issue this debt but then fail to complete the acquisition we will nevertheless incur interest expense which may be higher than any return we are able to achieve through investing the proceeds in our business or otherwise in addition we may be obliged to redeem this debt at redemption price that exceeds the net proceeds to from it initial issuance we may not achieve the anticipated benefit of the visa europe acquisition even if we complete the visa europe acquisition variety of factor may adversely affect any anticipated benefit to from the acquisition for example the process of integrating visa europe operation into ours may be more difficult and or may require more resource than we anticipate we may assume unexpected liability we may face an increased risk of customer loss for example if our european bank customer that were previously member of visa europe choose to expand business relationship with our competitor or otherwise support or engage in competing card or other payment solution there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulty commercial issue or condition and expenditure we would become subject to eu and other regulation that govern the operation of visa europe including new regulation governing the separation of scheme and processing that have not yet been fully defined well any ongoing or future litigation involving visa europe we may fail to retain key personnel of visa europe the transaction may divert the time and resource of our senior management and disrupt our current operation to greater degree than we currently contemplate we may not be able to repurchase share of our class common stock in amount sufficient to offset the dilution resulting from the preferred stock that we intend to issue part of the acquisition consideration and of content we may incur higher cost to finance the transaction than we currently contemplate if we do not successfully implement the visa europe acquisition or the acquisition is not completed on the term we currently contemplate our financial condition result of operation and prospect could be negatively impacted in particular although we currently expect the visa europe acquisition to be mildly accretive to adjusted earnings per share in fiscal year before one time integration cost if the expense associated with integrating visa europe into our operation and financing the acquisition are higher than we currently contemplate if we fail to achieve our revenue expectation due to unexpected customer loss or otherwise or if we do not achieve the benefit we anticipate from revenue synergy cost saving and increased repurchase of class common stock we may not achieve this goal item unresolved staff commentsnot applicable item propertiesat september we

substantial daily liquidity requirement dollar settlement are typically settled within the same day and do not result in net receivable or payable balance while settlement in currency other than the dollar generally remain outstanding for one to two business day which is consistent with industry practice for such transaction during fiscal we were not required to fund settlement related working capital our average daily net settlement position wa payable of million visa europe acquisition on november we entered into transaction agreement to acquire visa europe for total purchase price of up to billion the purchase price consists of at the closing of the transaction up front cash consideration of billion and preferred stock convertible upon certain condition into class common stock or class equivalent preferred stock valued at approximately billion and following the end of sixteen fiscal quarter post closing contingent cash consideration of up to billion plus up to an additional billion in interest determined based on the achievement of specified net revenue level during such post closing period closing is subject to regulatory approval and other customary condition and is currently expected to occur in the fiscal third quarter of see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement we also signed an option amendment which amended the term of the visa europe put option agreement to reflect the term of the transaction agreement if the acquisition of visa europe described above is not completed the put option will revert to it original unamended form the unamended put option agreement if exercised would require to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member if the acquisition doe not close and the put option reverts to it unamended term visa europe may exercise the unamended put option at any time thereafter the unamended put option agreement provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies visa inc forward price to earnings multiple defined in the unamended option agreement or the ratio at the time the unamended option is exercised to visa europe adjusted net income for the forward month period defined in the unamended option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise under the unamended term the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income would be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price the fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of visa europe option under it unamended term which under certain condition could obligate to purchase it member equity interest for an amount above fair value at september we determined the fair value of the unamended put option liability to be approximately million while this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the option is exercised under it unamended term the purchase price we could be obligated to pay day after exercise will represent substantial financial obligation given current economic condition the purchase price under the unamended term of the put option would likely be in excess of billion we may need to obtain third party financing either by borrowing fund or undertaking subsequent equity offering in order to fund this payment the amount of that potential obligation could vary dramatically based on among other thing visa europe adjusted sustainable income and our ratio in each case negotiated at the time the put option is exercised of contentsgiven the perpetual nature of the unamended put option and the various economic condition which could be present at the time of exercise our ultimate obligation in the event of exercise can not be reliably estimated the following table calculates our total obligation assuming for illustrative purpose only range of ratio for visa inc and assuming that visa europe demonstrates million of adjusted sustainable income at the date of exercise the million of assumed adjusted sustainable income provided below is for illustrative purpose only this doe not represent an estimate of the amount of adjusted sustainable income visa europe would have been able to demonstrate at september or will be able to demonstrate at any point in time in the future should visa europe elect to exercise it put option in it unamended form we believe it is likely that it will implement change in it business operation to move to for profit model in order to maximize it adjusted sustainable income and result to increase the purchase price the table also provides the amount of increase or decrease in the payout assuming the same range of estimated ratio for each million of adjusted sustainable income above or below the assumed million demonstrated at the time of exercise at september our estimated long term ratio wa and the long term differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated ratio applicable to visa europe wa at september the spot ratio wa and the spot differential the difference between this ratio and the estimated spot

litigation we are party to legal and regulatory proceeding with respect to variety of matter including certain litigation that we refer to the covered litigation noted above monetary liability from settlement of or judgment in the covered litigation are payable from the litigation escrow account during fiscal we made million in covered litigation payment that were funded from the litigation escrow account reflecting settlement with the individual opt out merchant in the interchange multidistrict litigation proceeding at september the litigation escrow account had an available balance of

our board of director declared quarterly dividend in the aggregate amount of per share of class common stock determined in the case of class and class common stock on an converted basis we expect to pay approximately million in connection with this dividend on december see note stockholder equity to our consolidated financial statement we expect to continue paying quarterly dividend in cash

fund our qualified pension plan in september of each year in fiscal and we made contribution to our pension and other postretirement plan of million million and million respectively in fiscal given current projection and assumption we anticipate funding our defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement plan by approximately million the actual contribution amount will vary depending upon the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement capital expenditure our capital expenditure decreased during fiscal reflecting the investment to upgrade our processing network during the fourth quarter of we expect to continue investing in technology asset and payment system infrastructure to support our digital solution and core business initiative acquisition during fiscal and fiscal we acquired business in which we previously held minority interest using million and million of cash on hand respectively these amount primarily reflect the respective purchase price le cash received these acquisition help to expand our loyalty solution for merchant by strengthening our merchant offer capability and extend our processing capability internationally see note intangible asset and goodwill to our consolidated financial statement fair value measurement financial instrument the assessment of fair value of our financial instrument is based on fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value observable input are obtained from independent source and can be validated by third party whereas unobservable input reflect assumption regarding third party would use in pricing an asset or liability of september our financial instrument measured at fair value on recurring basis included approximately billion of asset and million of liability of these instrument million had significant unobservable input including the unamended visa europe put option liability of million and million of auction rate security see note fair value measurement and investment to our consolidated financial statement balance sheet arrangement our off balance sheet arrangement are primarily comprised of guarantee and indemnification visa ha no off balance sheet debt other than lease and purchase order commitment discussed below and reflected in our contractual obligation table indemnification we indemnify our financial institution client for settlement loss suffered due to the failure of any other client to fund it settlement obligation in accordance with our rule the amount of the indemnification is limited to the amount of unsettled visa payment transaction at any point in time we maintain global credit settlement risk policy and procedure to manage settlement risk which may require client to post collateral if certain credit standard are not met see note summary of significant accounting policy and note settlement guarantee management to our consolidated financial statement in the ordinary course of business we enter into contractual arrangement with financial institution and other client under which we may agree to indemnify the client for certain type of loss incurred relating to the service we provide or otherwise relating to our performance under the applicable agreement contractual obligation our contractual commitment will have an impact on our future liquidity the contractual obligation identified in the table below include both on and off balance sheet transaction that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligation of september we believe that we will be able to fund these obligation through cash generated from our operation and available credit facility of content payment due by period le year more year total in million purchase order incentive and sponsorship represents agreement to purchase good and service that specify significant term including fixed or minimum quantity to be purchased and fixed minimum or variable price provision and the approximate timing of the transaction includes operating lease for premise equipment and software license which range in term from one to thirteen year represents future cash payment for long term contract with financial institution client and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these agreement which range in term from one to thirteen year can provide card issuance and or conversion support volume growth target and marketing and program support based on specific performance requirement payment under these agreement will generally be offset by revenue earned from higher corresponding payment and transaction volume these payment amount are estimate and will change based on client performance amendment to existing contract or execution of new contract related amount disclosed in note commitment and contingency to our consolidated financial statement represent the associated expected reduction of revenue related to these agreement that we estimate we will record visa is party to contractual sponsorship agreement ranging from approximately three to sixteen year these contract are designed to increase visa brand recognition drive visa branded product usage and differentiate visa against competition over the life of these contract visa is required to make payment in exchange for certain advertising and promotional right in connection with these contractual commitment visa ha an obligation to spend certain minimum amount for advertising and marketing promotion over the life of the contract for obligation where the individual year of spend are not specified in the contract we have estimated the timing of when these amount will be spent includes expected dividend amount of million dividend were declared in october and will be paid on december to all holder of record of visa common stock of november we have liability for uncertain tax position of million at september we had also accrued million of interest and million of penalty associated with our uncertain tax position we can not determine the range of cash payment that will be made and the timing of the cash settlement if any associated with our uncertain tax position therefore no amount related to these obligation have been included in the table on november we entered into an agreement to acquire visa europe for total purchase price of up to billion to be paid in combination of up front cash preferred stock and contingent cash consideration due four year after closing the agreement wa signed after the balance sheet date and closing of the acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and other customary condition the maximum potential purchase price is not included in the table above additionally in conjunction with the agreement to acquire visa europe we also entered into an option amendment which amended the term of the visa europe put option to align with the term of the transaction agreement to acquire visa europe if the acquisition doe not close the visa europe put option will revert to it original unamended term due to the perpetual nature of the unamended instrument and the various economic condition which could exist if the unamended put were exercised the ultimate amount and timing of visa obligation if any can not be reliably estimated therefore no amount related to this obligation have been included in the table however given the current economic condition and circumstance under which visa europe could exercise it unamended option the purchase price under the unamended term of the put option would likely be in excess of billion the fair value of the unamended visa europe put option totaling million at september ha also been excluded from this table it doe not represent the amount or an estimate of the amount of visa obligation in the event of exercise see the liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement of content we evaluate the need to make contribution to our pension plan after considering the funded status of the pension plan movement in the discount rate performance of the plan asset and related tax consequence expected contribution to our pension plan have not been included in the table such amount are dependent upon the consideration discussed above and may result in wide range of amount see note pension postretirement and other benefit to our consolidated financial statement and the liquidity and capital resource section of this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation critical accounting estimate our consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america which require to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported see note summary of significant accounting policy to our consolidated financial statement we have established policy and control procedure which seek to ensure that estimate and assumption are appropriately governed and applied consistently from period to period however actual result could differ from our assumption and estimate and such difference could be material we believe that the following accounting estimate are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial result they require our most subjective or complex management judgment resulting from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable revenue recognition client incentive critical estimate we enter into incentive agreement with financial institution client and other business partner for various program designed to build payment volume increase visa branded card and product acceptance and win merchant routing transaction over our network these incentive are primarily accounted for reduction to operating revenue however if separate identifiable benefit at fair value can be established they are accounted for operating expense we generally capitalize advance incentive payment under these agreement if select criterion are met the capitalization criterion include the existence of future economic benefit to visa the existence of legally enforceable recoverability language early termination clause management ability and intent to enforce the recoverability language and the ability to generate future earnings from the agreement in excess of amount deferred capitalized amount are amortized over the shorter of the period of contractual recoverability or the corresponding period of economic benefit incentive not yet paid are accrued systematically and rationally based on management estimate of each client performance these accrual are regularly reviewed and estimate of performance are adjusted appropriate based on change in performance expectation actual client performance amendment to existing contract or the execution of new contract assumption and judgment estimation of client incentive relies on forecast of payment volume card issuance and card conversion performance is estimated using customer reported information transactional information accumulated from our system historical information and discussion with our client impact if actual result differ from assumption if our client actual performance or recoverable cash flow are not consistent with our estimate client incentive may be materially different than initially recorded increase in incentive payment are generally driven by increased payment and transaction volume which drive our net revenue result in the event incentive payment exceed estimate such payment are not expected to have material effect on our financial condition result of operation or cash flow the cumulative impact of revision in estimate is recorded in the period such revision become probable and estimable for the year ended september client incentive represented of gross operating revenue fair value visa europe put option critical estimate on november the visa europe put option wa amended in conjunction with our agreement to acquire visa europe at september the fair value of the put option liability wa based on the unamended term if the acquisition of visa europe described in note visa europe is not completed the put option will revert to it original unamended form if the put option is exercised under it unamended term we will be required to purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member the unamended put option provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies our forward price to earnings multiple defined in the unamended option agreement or the ratio at the time the option is exercised to visa europe projected adjusted net income for the forward month period defined in the unamended option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income of contentsthe calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise of the unamended put option the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income would be the result of negotiation between and visa europe the unamended put option provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price see note visa europe to our consolidated financial statement for further detail regarding the calculation of the put exercise price under the unamended agreement the fair value of visa europe unamended option wa estimated to be approximately million at september while the unamended put option is in fact non transferable this amount recorded in our financial statement represents our estimate of the amount we would be required to pay third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the term of the unamended put agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined the estimated amount third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business condition probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe will never exercise it option in it unamended form while this amount represents the fair value of the unamended put option at september it doe not represent the actual purchase price that we may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised given current economic condition the purchase price under the unamended term of the put option would likely be in excess of billion see the liquidity and capital resource section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for further discussion assumption and judgment the most significant estimate used in the valuation of the unamended put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise it option in it unamended form and the estimated differential between the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the unamended put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe on stand alone basis at the time of exercise which we refer to the differential probability of exercise exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholder pursuant to authority granted to visa europe including under it article of association we estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended term of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including but not limited to visa europe stated intention if any to exercise the put option in it unamended form ii evaluation of market condition including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iii other qualitative factor including but not limited to qualitative factor related to visa europe largest member which could indicate change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holding differential the differential is determined by estimating the relative difference in the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock defined in the unamended put option agreement and that applicable to visa europe at the time of exercise for valuation purpose the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to our common stock at the time of exercise is estimated by evaluating various quantitative measure and qualitative factor quantitatively we estimate our ratio by dividing the average stock price over the preceding month the long term calculation and the last trading date the day calculation prior to the measurement date by the median estimate of our net income per share for the month starting with the next calendar quarter immediately following the reporting date this median earnings estimate is obtained from the institutional broker estimate system we then determine the best estimate of our long term price to earnings multiple for valuation purpose by qualitatively evaluating the day calculation compared to the long term calculation in this evaluation we examine both measure to determine whether difference if any are the result of fundamental change in our long term value or the result of short term market volatility or other non company specific market factor that may not be indicative of our long term forward we believe given the perpetual nature of the unamended put option that market participant would more heavily weigh long term value indicator opposed to short term indicator factor that might indicate fundamental change in long term value include but are not limited to change in the regulatory environment client portfolio long term growth rate or new product innovation consistent methodology is applied to group of comparable public company used to estimate the forward price to earnings of contentsmultiple applicable to visa europe these estimate therefore are impacted by change in stock price and the financial market expectation of our future earnings and those of comparable company other estimate of lesser significance include growth rate and foreign currency exchange rate applied in the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income growth rate assumed in the valuation reflect for profit model we believe it is likely that should visa europe choose to exercise the put option in it unamended form it will seek to maximize the purchase price by adopting for profit business model in advance of exercising the unamended put option the foreign exchange rate used to translate visa europe result from euro to dollar reflects blend of forward exchange rate observed in the marketplace the assumed timing of exercise of the unamended put option used in the various modeled scenario is not an overly significant assumption in the valuation obligation calculated in later year are more heavily discounted in the calculation of present value impact if actual result differ from assumption in the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at september we have assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise that is higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the unamended put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the unamended put option the unamended put option is exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liability in our consolidated balance sheet at september classification in current liability reflects the fact that this obligation could become payable within month at september legal and regulatory matter critical estimate we are currently involved in various legal proceeding the outcome of which are not within our complete control or may not be known for prolonged period of time management is required to ass the probability of loss and amount of such loss if any in preparing our financial statement assumption and judgment we evaluate the likelihood of potential loss from legal or regulatory proceeding to which we are party we record liability for such claim when loss is deemed probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel additional information becomes available we reassess the potential liability related to pending claim and may revise our estimate our retrospective responsibility plan only address monetary liability from settlement of or final judgment in the covered litigation the plan mechanism include the use of the litigation escrow account the accrual related to the covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance we did not record an accrual for the covered litigation during fiscal see note retrospective responsibility plan and potential visa europe liability and note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement impact if actual result differ from assumption due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdiction in which we operate our judgment may be materially different than the actual outcome which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation see note legal matter to our consolidated financial statement income tax critical estimate in calculating our effective income tax rate we make judgment regarding certain tax position including the timing and amount of deduction and allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction assumption and judgment we have various tax filing position with regard to the timing and amount of deduction and credit the establishment of liability for uncertain tax position and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdiction we are also required to inventory evaluate and measure all uncertain tax position taken or to be taken on tax return and to record liability for the amount of such position that may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority impact if actual result differ from assumption although we believe that our estimate and judgment are reasonable actual result may differ from these estimate some or all of these judgment are subject to review by of contentsthe taxing authority if one or more of the taxing authority were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded and we were unable to realize this benefit it could have material adverse effect on our financial result and cash flow item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskmarket risk is the potential economic loss arising from adverse change in market factor our exposure to financial market risk result primarily from fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate interest rate and equity price aggregate risk exposure are monitored on an ongoing basis foreign currency exchange rate riskalthough most of our activity are transacted in dollar we are exposed to adverse fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation are primarily related to adverse change in the dollar value of revenue generated from foreign currency denominated transaction and adverse change in the dollar value of payment in foreign currency primarily for expense at our non location we manage these risk by entering into foreign currency forward contract that hedge exposure of the variability in the dollar equivalent of anticipated non dollar denominated cash flow our foreign currency exchange rate risk management program reduces but doe not entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movement the aggregate notional amount of our foreign currency forward contract outstanding in our exchange rate risk management program including contract not designated for cash flow hedge accounting were billion and billion at september and respectively the aggregate notional amount outstanding at september is fully consistent with our strategy and treasury policy aimed at reducing foreign exchange risk below predetermined and approved threshold however actual result could materially differ from our forecast the effect of hypothetical change in the value of the dollar is estimated to create an additional fair value gain or loss of approximately million on our foreign currency forward contract outstanding at september see note summary of significant accounting policy and note derivative financial instrument to our consolidated financial statement we are also subject to foreign currency exchange risk in daily settlement activity this risk arises from the timing of rate setting for settlement with client relative to the timing of market trade for balancing currency position risk in settlement activity is limited through daily operating procedure including the utilization of visa settlement system and our interaction with foreign exchange trading counterparties interest rate riskour investment portfolio asset are held in both fixed rate and adjustable rate security these asset are included in cash equivalent and short term or long term available for sale investment investment in fixed rate instrument carry degree of interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate security may be adversely impacted due to rise in interest rate additionally falling rate environment creates reinvestment risk because security mature the proceeds are reinvested at lower rate generating le interest income historically we have been able to hold investment until maturity neither our operating result or cash flow have been nor are expected to be materially impacted by sudden change in market interest rate the fair value balance of our fixed rate investment security at september and were billion and billion respectively hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rate would create an estimated change in fair value of approximately million on our fixed rate investment security at september the fair value balance of our adjustable rate debt security were billion and billion at september and respectively visa europe put optionwe have liability related to the put option with visa europe which is recorded at fair value at september based on it unamended term we are required to ass the fair value of the put option on quarterly basis and record adjustment necessary in the determination of the fair value of the unamended put option at september we assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and differential at the time of exercise of approximately the use of probability of exercise higher than our estimate would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the value of the unamended put option an increase of in the assumed differential would have resulted in an increase of approximately of contentsmillion in the value of the unamended put option see liquidity and capital resource and critical accounting estimate

revert to it original unamended form if the transaction agreement is terminated without completion of the acquisition visa europe put option agreement discussed above on november the company and visa

purchase all of the outstanding share of capital stock of visa europe from it member the company is required to purchase the share of visa europe no later than day after exercise of the unamended put option the unamended put option agreement provides formula for determining the purchase price of the visa europe share which subject to certain adjustment applies visa inc forward price to earnings multiple defined in the unamended option agreement or the ratio at the time the unamended option is exercised to visa europe adjusted net income for the forward month period defined in the unamended option agreement or the adjusted sustainable income the calculation of visa europe adjusted sustainable income under the term of the unamended put option agreement includes potentially material adjustment for cost synergy and other negotiated item upon exercise under the unamended term the key input to this formula including visa europe adjusted sustainable income would be the result of negotiation between the company and visa europe the unamended put option agreement provides an arbitration mechanism in the event that the two party are unable to agree on the ultimate purchase price the fair value of the unamended put option represents the value of visa europe option under it unamended term which under certain condition could obligate the company to purchase it member equity interest for an amount above fair value the fair value of the unamended put option doe not represent the actual purchase price that the company may be required to pay if the unamended option is exercised given current economic condition the purchase price under the unamended term of the put option would likely be in excess of billion while the unamended put option is in fact non transferable it fair value represents the company estimate of the amount the company would be required to pay third party market participant to transfer the potential obligation in an orderly transaction the fair value of the unamended put option is computed by comparing the estimated strike price under the term of the unamended put option agreement to the estimated fair value of visa europe the fair value of visa europe is defined the estimated amount third party market participant might pay in an arm length transaction under normal business condition probability of exercise assumption is applied to reflect the possibility that visa europe may never exercise it option in it unamended form the estimated fair value of the unamended put option represents level accounting estimate due to lack of trading in active market and lack of observable input in measuring fair value see note fair value measurement and investment the valuation of the unamended put option therefore requires substantial judgment the most subjective of estimate applied in valuing the unamended put option are the assumed probability that visa europe will elect to exercise it option in it unamended form and the estimated differential between the ratio and the ratio applicable to visa europe on standalone basis at the time of exercise which the company refers to the differential exercise of the unamended put option is at the sole discretion of visa europe on behalf of the visa europe shareholder pursuant to authority granted to visa europe including under it article of association the company estimate the assumed probability of exercise based on the unamended term of the put option agreement and other reasonably available information including but not limited to visa europe stated intention if any to exercise the put option in it unamended form ii evaluation of market condition including the regulatory environment that could impact the potential future profitability of visa europe and iii other qualitative factor including but not limited to qualitative factor related to visa europe largest member which could indicate change in their need or desire to liquidate their investment holding factor impacting the assumed differential used in the calculation include material change in the ratio of visa and those of group of comparable company used to estimate the forward price to earnings multiple applicable to visa europe the company determined the fair value of the unamended put option to be approximately million at september and million at september the increase in value wa primarily driven by an of contentsvisa inc note to consolidated financial statement continued september in estimated visa europe adjusted sustainable income partially offset by decrease in the differential in determining the fair value of the unamended put option on these date the company assumed probability of exercise by visa europe at some point in the future and an estimated long term differential at the time of exercise of and respectively change in the fair value of the put option are recorded non cash non operating expense in the company consolidated statement of operation at september the unamended put option wa exercisable at any time at the sole discretion of visa europe such the unamended put option liability is included in accrued liability on the company consolidated
