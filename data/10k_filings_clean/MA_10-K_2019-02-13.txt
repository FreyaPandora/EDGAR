risk factorslegal and regulatorypayments industry regulationglobal regulatory and legislative activity directly related to the payment industry may have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation regulator increasingly seek to regulate certain aspect of payment system such ours or establish or expand their authority to do so many jurisdiction have enacted such regulation these regulation have established and could further expand obligation or restriction with respect to the type of product and service that we may offer to financial institution for consumer the country in which our integrated product and service may be used the way we structure and operate our business and the type of consumer and merchant who can obtain or accept our product or service new regulation and oversight could also relate to our clearing and settlement activity including risk management policy and procedure collateral requirement participant default policy and procedure the ability to complete timely switching of financial transaction and capital and financial resource requirement in addition several central bank or similar regulatory body around the world have increased or are seeking to increase their formal oversight of the electronic payment industry and in some case are considering designating certain payment network systemically important payment system or critical infrastructure of contentsthese obligation designation and restriction may further expand and could conflict with each other more jurisdiction impose oversight of payment system some enacted regulation require financial institution to provide third party payment processor access to consumer payment account this may enable these third party payment processor to route transaction away from mastercard product by offering account information or payment initiation service directly to people who currently use our product this may also allow these processor to commoditize the data that are included in the transaction new authentication standard have been enacted requiring additional verification information from consumer to complete transaction this may increase the number of transaction that consumer abandon if we are unable to ensure frictionless authentication experience an increase in the rate of abandoned transaction could adversely impact our volume or other operational metric increased regulation and oversight of payment system may result in costly compliance burden or otherwise increase our cost such law or compliance burden could result in issuer and acquirer being le willing to participate in our payment system reduce the benefit offered in connection with the use of our product making our product le desirable to consumer reduce the volume of domestic and cross border transaction or other operational metric disintermediate impact our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated product and service all of which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance regulator could also require to obtain prior approval for change to it system rule procedure or operation or could require customization with regard to such change which could impact market participant risk and therefore risk to such regulatory change could lead to new or different criterion for participation in and access to our payment system by financial institution or other customer moreover failure to comply with the law and regulation to which we are subject could result in fine sanction civil damage or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation well have an impact on our brand and reputation increased regulatory legislative and litigation activity with respect to interchange rate could have an adverse impact on our business interchange rate are significant component of the cost that merchant pay in connection with the acceptance of our product although we do not earn revenue from interchange interchange rate can impact the volume of transaction we see on our payment product if interchange rate are high merchant may stop accepting our product or route debit transaction away from our network if interchange rate are too low issuer may stop promoting our integrated product and service eliminate or reduce loyalty reward program or other account holder benefit free checking or low interest rate on balance or charge fee to account holder annual fee or late payment fee government and merchant group in number of country have implemented or are seeking interchange rate reduction through legislation competition law central bank regulation and litigation see government regulation and note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for more detail if issuer can not collect or we are forced to reduce interchange rate issuer may be le willing to participate in our four party payment system or may reduce the benefit offered in connection with the use of our product reducing the attractiveness of our product to consumer in particular potential change to interregional interchange fee result of the proposed resolution of the european commission investigation could impact our cross border transaction activity disproportionately versus competitor that are not subject to similar reduction these and other impact could lower transaction volume and or make proprietary three party network or other form of payment more attractive issuer could reduce the benefit associated with our product or choose to charge higher fee to consumer to attempt to recoup portion of the cost incurred for their service in addition issuer could seek to decrease the expense of their payment program by seeking reduction in the fee that we charge to them particularly if regulation ha disproportionate impact on compared to our competitor in term of the fee we can charge this could make our product le desirable to consumer reduce the volume of transaction and our profitability and limit our ability to innovate or offer differentiated product we are devoting substantial resource to defending our right to establish interchange rate in regulatory proceeding litigation and legislative activity the potential outcome of any of these activity could have more positive or negative impact on relative to our competitor if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our ability to establish interchange rate any resulting legislation regulation and or litigation may have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation in addition regulatory proceeding and litigation could result and in some case ha resulted in being fined and or having to pay civil damage the amount of which could be material of contentscurrent regulatory activity could be extended to additional jurisdiction or product which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation regulator around the world increasingly replicate other regulator approach with regard to the regulation of payment and other industry consequently regulation in any one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in other country state or region similarly new law and regulation within country state or region involving one product may lead to regulation of similar or related product for example regulation affecting debit transaction could lead to regulation of other product such credit result the risk to our business created by any one new law or regulation are magnified by the potential it ha to be replicated in other jurisdiction or involve other product within any particular jurisdiction these include matter like interchange rate potential direct regulation of our network fee and pricing network standard and network exclusivity and routing agreement conversely if widely varying regulation come into existence worldwide we may have difficulty adjusting our product service fee and other important aspect of our business to meet the varying requirement either of these outcome could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation limitation on our ability to restrict merchant surcharging could materially and adversely impact our result of operation we have historically implemented policy referred to no surcharge rule in certain jurisdiction including the united state that prohibit merchant from charging higher price to consumer who pay using our product instead of other mean authority in several jurisdiction have acted to end or limit the application of these no surcharge rule or indicated interest in so additionally we have modified our no surcharge rule to permit merchant to surcharge credit card subject to certain limitation it is possible that over time merchant in some or all merchant category in these jurisdiction may choose to surcharge permitted by the rule change this could result in consumer viewing our product le favorably and or using alternative mean of payment instead of electronic product which could result in decrease in our overall transaction volume and which in turn could materially and adversely impact our result of operation preferential or protective government actionspreferential and protective government action related to domestic payment service could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue government in some country have acted or in the future may act to provide resource preferential treatment or other protection to selected national payment and switching provider or have created or may in the future create their own national provider this action may displace from prevent from entering into or substantially restrict from participating in particular geography and may prevent from competing effectively against those provider for example government in some country are considering or may consider regulatory requirement that mandate switching of domestic payment either entirely in that country or by only domestic company some jurisdiction are considering requirement to collect process and or store data within their border well prohibition on the transfer of data abroad leading to technological and operational implication geopolitical event and resulting ofac sanction adverse trade policy or other type of government action could lead jurisdiction affected by those sanction to take action in response that could adversely affect our business regional group of country are considering or may consider effort to restrict our participation in the switching of regional transaction such development prevent from utilizing our global switching capability for domestic or regional customer our effort to effect change in or work with these country may not succeed this could adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and extend our global brand privacy data protection and securityregulation of privacy data protection security and the digital economy could increase our cost well negatively impact our growth we are subject to increasingly complex regulation related to privacy data protection and information security in the jurisdiction in which we do business these regulation could result in negative impact to our business we continue to develop integrated of contentsproducts and service to meet the need of changing marketplace well acquire new company we may expand our information profile through the collection of additional data from additional source and across multiple channel this expansion could amplify the impact of these regulation on our business regulation of privacy and data protection and information security often time require monitoring of and change to our data practice in regard to the collection use disclosure storage transfer and or security of personal and sensitive information we are also subject to enhanced compliance and operational requirement in the european union and policymakers around the globe are using these requirement reference to adopt new or updated privacy law that could result in similar or stricter requirement in other jurisdiction some jurisdiction are also considering requirement to collect process and or store data within their border well prohibition on the transfer of data abroad leading to technological and operational implication other jurisdiction are considering adopting sector specific regulation for the payment industry including forced data sharing requirement or additional verification requirement that overlap or conflict with or diverge from general privacy rule failure to comply with these law regulation and requirement could result in fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation and overall business well have an impact on our reputation new requirement or reinterpretation of existing requirement in these area or the development of new regulatory scheme related to the digital economy in general may also increase our cost and could impact the product and service we offer and other aspect of our business such fraud monitoring the development of information based product and solution and technology operation in addition these requirement may increase the cost to our customer of issuing payment product which may in turn decrease the number of our payment product that they issue moreover due to account data compromise event and privacy abuse by other company well the disclosure of monitoring activity by certain governmental agency in combination with the use of artificial intelligence and new technology there ha been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirement and or future enforcement those development have also raised public attention on company data practice and have changed consumer and societal expectation for enhanced privacy and data protection any of these development could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition fraudulent activity could encourage regulatory intervention which could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated product and service or increase our compliance cost criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture consumer account information to engage in illegal activity such counterfeiting or other fraud outsourcing and specialization become common in the payment industry there are more third party involved in processing transaction using our payment product while we are taking measure to make card and digital payment more secure increased fraud level involving our integrated product and service or misconduct or negligence by third party switching or otherwise servicing our integrated product and service could lead to regulatory intervention such enhanced security requirement well damage to our reputation other regulation regulation that directly or indirectly apply to mastercard result of our participation in the global payment industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation we are subject to regulation that affect the payment industry in the many jurisdiction in which our integrated product and service are used many of our customer are also subject to regulation applicable to bank and other financial institution that at time consequently affect regulation of the payment industry including regulation applicable to and our customer ha increased significantly in the last several year see business government regulation in part item for detailed description of such regulation and related legislation example include anti money laundering counter terrorist financing economic sanction and anti corruption we are subject to aml and ctf law and regulation globally including the bank secrecy act and the usa patriot act well the various economic sanction program including those imposed and administered by ofac the economic sanction program administered by ofac restrict financial

iran sudan and syria have been identified by the state department terrorist sponsoring state we are also subject to anti corruption law and regulation globally including the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act which among other thing generally prohibit giving or offering payment or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage violation and subsequent judgment or settlement against or those with whom we may be associated under these law could subject to substantial monetary penalty damage and or have significant reputational impact of content account based payment system in the the treasury ha expanded the bank of england oversight of certain payment system provider that are systemically important to payment network result of these change aspect of our vocalink business are now subject to the payment system oversight regime and are directly overseen by the bank of england issuer practice legislation and regulation our financial institution customer are subject to numerous regulation which impact consequence in addition certain regulation such in the eea may disintermediate issuer if our customer are disintermediated in their business we could face diminished demand for our integrated product and service in addition existing or new regulation in these or other area may diminish the attractiveness of our product to our customer regulation of internet and digital transaction proposed legislation in various jurisdiction relating to internet gambling and other digital area such cyber security and copyright and trademark infringement could impose additional compliance burden on and or our customer including requiring or our customer to monitor filter restrict or otherwise oversee various category of payment transaction increased regulatory focus on such in connection with the matter discussed above may result in costly compliance burden and or may otherwise increase our cost similarly increased regulatory focus on our customer may cause such customer to reduce the volume of transaction processed through our system or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our product action by regulator could influence other organization around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measure amplifying any potential compliance burden finally failure to comply with the law and regulation discussed above to which we are subject could result in fine sanction or other penalty each may individually or collectively materially and adversely affect our financial performance and or our overall business and result of operation well have an impact on our reputation we could be subject to adverse change in tax law regulation and interpretation or challenge to our tax position we are subject to tax law and regulation of the federal state and local government well various non jurisdiction potential change in existing tax law including future regulatory guidance may impact our effective tax rate and tax payment there can be no assurance that change in tax law or regulation both within the and the other jurisdiction in which we operate will not materially and adversely affect our effective tax rate tax payment financial condition and result of operation similarly change in tax law and regulation that impact our customer and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and result of operation in addition tax law and regulation are complex and subject to varying interpretation and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax law and regulation in all relevant jurisdiction could give rise to substantial penalty and liability any change in enacted tax law rule or regulatory or judicial interpretation any adverse outcome in connection with tax audit in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncement relating to accounting for income tax could materially and adversely impact our effective tax rate tax payment financial condition and result of operation litigationliabilities we may incur or limitation on our business related to any litigation or litigation settlement could materially and adversely affect our result of operation we are defendant on number of civil litigation and regulatory proceeding and investigation including among others those alleging violation of competition and antitrust law and those involving intellectual property claim see note legal and regulatory proceeding to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item for more detail regarding the allegation contained in these complaint and the status of these proceeding in the event we are found liable in any material litigation or proceeding particularly in the event we may be found liable in large class action lawsuit or on the basis of an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damage or under which we were jointly and severally liable we could be subject to significant damage which could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation certain limitation have been placed on our business in recent year because of litigation and litigation settlement such change to our no surcharge rule in the united state any future limitation on our business resulting from litigation or litigation settlement could impact our relationship with our customer including reducing the volume of business that we do with them which may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation of contentsbusiness and operationscompetition and technologysubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payment industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the global payment industry is highly competitive our payment program compete against all form of payment including cash and check electronic mobile and commerce payment platform cryptocurrencies ach payment service and other payment network which can have several competitive impact on our business some of our traditional competitor well alternative payment service provider may have substantially greater financial and other resource than we have may offer wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategy to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have our ability to compete may also be affected by the outcome of litigation competition related regulatory proceeding central bank activity and legislative activity certain of our competitor operate three party payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and these competitor may derive competitive advantage from their business model if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitor because we operate four party system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in way in which our competitor are not we could lose business to these competitor see business competition in part item if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor drive value for our customer and or effectively align our resource with our goal and objective we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat our competitor may also more effectively introduce their own innovative program and service that adversely impact our growth we also compete against new entrant that have developed alternative payment system commerce payment system and payment system for mobile device well physical store location number of these new entrant rely principally on the internet to support their service and may enjoy lower cost than we do which could put at competitive disadvantage our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation disintermediation from stakeholder both within and outside of the payment value chain could harm our business the payment industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risk including party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position an intermediary in the payment process for example merchant could switch and in some case are switching transaction directly with issuer additionally processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer large scale consolidation within processor could result in these processor developing bilateral agreement or in some case switching the entire transaction on their own network thereby disintermediating regulation in the eea may disintermediate by enabling third party provider opportunity to route payment transaction away from our network and towards other form of payment although we partner with technology company such digital player and mobile provider that leverage our technology platform and network to deliver their product they could develop platform or network that disintermediate from digital payment and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy this risk is heightened when we have relationship with these entity where we share mastercard data while we share this data in controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data protection standard without proper oversight we could inadvertently share too much data which could give the partner competitive advantage competitor customer technology company government and other industry participant may develop product that compete with or replace value added product and service we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offering these product could replace our own switching and payment offering or could force to change our pricing or practice for these offering in addition government that develop national payment platform may promote their platform in such way that could put at competitive disadvantage in those market of content participant in the payment industry may merge create joint venture or form other business combination that may strengthen their existing business service or create new payment product and service that compete with our service our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in order to increase transaction volume enter new market and expand our mastercard branded card and enabled product and service we seek to enter into business agreement with customer through which we offer incentive pricing discount and other support that promote our product in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentive and pricing discount over the past several year we have experienced continued pricing pressure the demand from our customer for better pricing arrangement and greater rebate and incentive moderate our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to switch additional transaction volume or to provide additional service to our customer at level sufficient to compensate for such lower fee or increased cost in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition increased pressure on price increase the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those relating to customer incentive in the future we may not be able to enter into agreement with our customer if they require term that we are unable or unwilling to offer and we may be required to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitor are larger and have greater financial resource than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower price to our customer in addition to the extent that we offer discount or incentive under such agreement we will need to further increase transaction volume or the amount of service provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreement and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customer also may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase request for greater incentive or greater cost stability these factor could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation rapid and significant technological development and change could negatively impact our overall business and result of operation or limit our future growth the payment industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change which can impact our business in several way technological change including continuing development of technology in the area of smart card and device contactless and mobile payment commerce cryptocurrency and block chain technology machine learning and ai could result in new technology that may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our program and service moreover these change could result in new and innovative payment method and product that could place at competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our product we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology the inability of these company to keep pace with technological development or the acquisition of these company by competitor could negatively impact our offering our ability to develop and adopt new service and technology may be inhibited by industry wide solution and standard such those related to emv tokenization or other safety and security technology and by resistance from customer or merchant to such change our ability to develop evolving system and product may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining technology expert our ability to adopt these technology can also be inhibited by intellectual property right of third party we have received and we may in the future receive notice or inquiry from patent holder for example other operating company or non practicing entity suggesting that we may be infringing certain patent or that we need to license the use of their patent to avoid infringement such notice may among other thing threaten litigation against or our customer or demand significant license fee our ability to develop new technology and reflect technological change in our payment offering will require resource which may result in additional expense of content we work with technology company such digital player and mobile provider that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment related product and service quickly and efficiently to consumer our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customer to work with and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard failure to keep pace with these technological development or otherwise bring to market product that reflect these technology could lead to decline in the use of our product which could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation operating real time account based payment network present risk that could materially affect our business our acquisition of vocalink in added real time account based payment technology to the suite of capability we offer while expansion into this space present business opportunity there are also regulatory and operational risk associated with administering real time account based payment network british regulator have designated this platform to be critical national infrastructure and regulator in other country may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real time account based payment system in similar way in addition any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impact including potential intervention by the bank of england and significant reputational risk to vocalink and for discussion of the regulatory risk related to our real time account based payment platform see our risk factor in risk factor payment industry regulation in this part item furthermore the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerability that are different from those faced on our core network operational difficulty such the temporary unavailability of our service or product or security breach on our real time account based payment network could cause loss of business for these product and service result in potential liability for and adversely affect our reputation working with new customer and end user we expand our integrated product and service can present operational challenge be costly and result in reputational damage if the new product or service do not perform intended the payment market in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change new product introduction evolving industry standard and changing customer and consumer need in order to remain competitive and meet the need of the payment market we are continually involved in diversifying our integrated product and service these effort carry the risk associated with any diversification initiative including cost overrun delay in delivery and performance problem these project also carry risk associated with working with different type of customer for example organization such corporation that are not financial institution and non governmental organization ngo and end user than those we have traditionally worked with these difference may present new operational challenge in the development and implementation of our new product or service our failure to render these integrated product and service could make our other integrated product and service le desirable to customer or put at competitive disadvantage in addition if there is delay in the implementation of our product or service or if our product or service do not perform anticipated we could face additional regulatory scrutiny fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation well negatively impact our brand and reputation information security and service disruptionsinformation security incident or account data compromise event could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our cost and cause loss information security risk for payment and technology company such ours have significantly increased in recent year in part because of the proliferation of new technology the use of the internet and telecommunication technology to conduct financial transaction and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime hacker terrorist and other external party these threat may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employee or third party or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threat include cyber attack such computer virus malicious code phishing attack or information security breach and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft our operation rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer system and network our customer and other party in the payment value chain well account holder rely on our digital technology computer system software and network to conduct their operation in addition to access our of contentsintegrated product and service our customer and account holder increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pc and other mobile device that may be beyond our control we like other financial technology organization routinely are subject to cyber threat and our technology system and network have been subject to attempted cyber attack because of our position in the payment value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be target of such threat and attack additionally geopolitical event and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threat and attack by affected jurisdiction and their sympathizer to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber attack or other information security breach however future attack or breach could lead to security breach of the network system or device that our customer use to access our integrated product and service which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromise such attack or breach could also cause service interruption malfunction or other failure in the physical infrastructure or operation system that support our business and customer such the lack of availability of our value added service well the operation of our customer or other third party in addition they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customer and other party and the market additional cost to such repairing system adding new personnel or protection technology or compliance cost regulatory penalty financial loss to both and our customer and partner and the loss of customer and business opportunity if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded despite various mitigation effort that we undertake there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risk and not suffer material breach and resulting loss in the future or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all loss our risk and exposure to these matter remain heightened because of among other thing the evolving nature of these threat our prominent size and scale and

of our largest financial institution customer could lead to significant revenue decrease in the longer term which could have material adverse impact on our business and our result of operation most of our financial institution customer relationship are not exclusive and may be terminated by our customer our customer can reassess their commitment to at any time in the future and or develop their own competitive service accordingly our business agreement with these customer may not reduce the risk inherent in our business that customer may terminate their relationship with in favor of relationship with our competitor or for other reason or might not meet their contractual obligation to in addition significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest financial institution customer loss of business from any of our large customer could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation exclusive near exclusive relationship certain customer have with our competitor may have material adverse impact on our business certain customer have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor to issue payment product and these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to do significant amount of business with them to increase our revenue in addition these customer may be more successful and may grow faster than the customer that primarily issue our payment product which could put at competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customer with nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor such relationship could provide advantage to the customer to shift business from to the competitor with which they are principally aligned significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volume from these customer could have material adverse impact on our business consolidation in the banking industry could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the banking industry ha undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past consolidation have included customer with substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institution with strong relationship with competitor if significant consolidation among customer were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for which could have material adverse impact on our business and prospect in addition one or more of our customer could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitor and any such transaction could also have material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce smaller number of large customer which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower price and or more favorable term for our customer these

many jurisdiction their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brand while we work directly with many stakeholder in the payment system including merchant government and large digital company and other technology company we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationship with our issuer and acquirer and their respective relationship with account holder and merchant to support our program and service furthermore we depend on our issuing partner and acquirer to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market we do not issue card or other payment device extend credit to account holder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to account holder each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program feature in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchant are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customer result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and the strength of our relationship with them in turn our customer success depends on variety of factor over which we have little or no influence including economic condition in global financial market or their disintermediation by competitor or emerging technology well regulation if our customer become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in risk factor settlement and third party obligation in this part item with respect to how we guarantee certain third party

in risk factor risk related to our participation in the payment industry in this part item with respect to payment industry regulation including interchange fee the continued focus of merchant on the cost of accepting various form of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding certain larger merchant are also able to negotiate incentive from and pricing concession from our issuer and acquirer customer condition to accepting our product we also make payment to certain merchant to incentivize them to create co branded payment program with merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentive that we provide to certain merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer our work with government expose to unique risk that could have material impact on our business and result of operation we increase our work with national state and local government both indirectly through financial institution and with them directly our customer we may face various risk inherent in associating or contracting directly with government these risk include

mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new mastercard product and requesting greater incentive or greater cost stability from consumer and business lowering spending which could impact cross border travel pattern on which significant portion of our revenue is dependent government intervention including the effect of law regulation and or government investment on or in our financial institution customer well uncertainty due to changing political regime in executive legislative and or judicial branch of government that may have potential negative effect on our business and our relationship with customer or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our product tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facility additionally we switch substantially all cross border transaction using mastercard maestro and cirrus branded card and generate significant amount of revenue from cross border volume fee and fee related to switched transaction revenue from switching cross border and currency conversion transaction for our customer fluctuates with the level and destination of cross border travel and our customer need for transaction to be converted into their base currency cross border activity may be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic weather and other condition these include the threat of terrorism and outbreak of flu virus and other disease well major environmental event the uncertainty that could result from such event could decrease cross border activity additionally any regulation of interregional interchange fee could also negatively impact our cross border activity in each case decreased cross border activity could decrease the revenue we receive any of these development could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation adverse currency fluctuation and foreign exchange control could negatively impact our result of operation during approximately of our revenue wa generated from activity outside the united state this revenue and the related expense could be transacted in non functional currency or valued based on currency other than the functional currency of the entity generating the revenue resulting exchange gain and loss are included in our net income our risk management activity provide protection with respect to adverse change in the value of only limited number of currency and are based on estimate of exposure to these currency in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united state is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuation including devaluation of currency where the value of other currency change relative to the dollar if the dollar strengthens compared to currency in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulation that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currency into dollar such what we have experienced in venezuela the occurrence of currency fluctuation or exchange control could have material adverse impact on our result of operation the united kingdom proposed withdrawal from the european union could harm our business and financial result in june voter in the united kingdom approved the withdrawal of the from the commonly referred to brexit the government triggered article of the lisbon treaty on march which commenced the official withdrawal process uncertainty over the term of the departure from the could cause political and economic uncertainty in the and the rest of europe which could harm our business and financial result brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national law and regulation in the and we well our client who have significant operation in the may incur additional cost and expense we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory framework from the rest of the we may also face additional complexity with regard to immigration and travel right for our employee located in the and the these factor

the british pound our overall operating result are impacted by foreign currency translation which represents the effect of translating operating result where the functional currency is different than our dollar reporting currency our operating result can also be impacted by transactional foreign currency the impact of the transactional foreign currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transaction occurring in currency other than the functional currency change in foreign currency exchange rate directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume gdv and gross euro volume gev which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessment cross border volume fee and volume related rebate and incentive in most non european region gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to dollar using average exchange rate for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euro using average exchange rate for the period result our domestic assessment cross border volume fee and volume related rebate and incentive are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the dollar versus non european local currency and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currency for example our billing in australia is in the dollar however consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar the foreign currency transactional impact of converting australian dollar to our dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the dollar is evident when gdv growth on dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on local currency basis in gdv on dollar converted basis increased while gdv of contentson local currency basis increased versus in gdv on dollar converted basis increased while gdv on local currency basis increased versus further the impact from transactional foreign currency occurs in transaction processing revenue other revenue and operating expense when the local currency of these item are different than the functional currency we incur foreign currency gain and loss from remeasuring monetary asset and liability that are in currency other than the functional currency and from remeasuring foreign exchange derivative contract foreign exchange activity the impact of foreign exchange activity ha not been eliminated in our currency neutral result see non gaap financial information and is recorded in general and administrative expense we manage foreign currency balance sheet remeasurement and cash flow risk through our foreign exchange risk management activity which are discussed further in note foreign exchange risk management to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item since we do not designate foreign currency derivative hedging instrument pursuant to the accounting standard for derivative instrument and hedging activity we record gain and loss on foreign exchange derivative immediately in current period earnings with the related hedged item being recognized the exposure materialize we are exposed to currency devaluation in certain

estimating customer performance including review of specific transaction historical experience with that customer and market and economic condition difference between actual result and our estimate

determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable our judgment are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceeding the merit of our defense and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel because of uncertainty related to these matter accrual are based only on the best information available at the time additional information becomes

to reduce our deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized significant judgment is required in determining the valuation allowance we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategy in assessing the need for the valuation allowance if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax asset in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize deferred tax asset we would adjust the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is made with corresponding increase or decrease to earnings we record tax liability for uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority we consider all relevant fact and current authority in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained of contentsand if so

controlling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration impairment testing for asset other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset requires the allocation of cash flow to those asset or group of asset and if required an estimate of fair value for the asset or group of asset we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment on an annual basis or sooner if indicator of impairment exist goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing quantitative assessment we use market capitalization for estimating the fair value of our reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value goodwill is not impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value then goodwill is impaired and the excess of the reporting unit carrying value over the fair value is recognized an impairment charge the impairment test for indefinite lived intangible asset consists of qualitative assessment to evaluate all relevant event and circumstance that could affect the significant input used to determine the fair value of indefinite lived intangible asset in performing these qualitative assessment we consider relevant event and condition including but not limited to macroeconomic trend industry and market condition overall financial performance cost factor company specific event and legal and regulatory factor if the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is le than their carrying amount we must perform quantitative
