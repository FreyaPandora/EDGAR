new payment competitor continue to emerge in response to evolving technology consumer habit and merchant need in addition to the discussion in this section see our operating result may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payment industry in risk factor for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition and ongoing legal proceeding regarding provision in our merchant contract could have material adverse effect on our business and result in additional litigation and or arbitration substantial monetary damage and damage to our reputation and brand in risk factor for discussion of the potential impact on our ability to compete effectively due to government regulation or if ongoing legal proceeding limit our ability to prevent merchant from engaging in various action to discriminate our card product table of content supervision and regulation overview we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision in jurisdiction around the world and the cost of compliance are substantial in recent year the financial service industry ha been subject to rigorous scrutiny high regulatory expectation and stringent and unpredictable enforcement environment governmental authority have focused and we believe will continue to focus considerable attention on reviewing compliance by financial service firm with law and regulation review to ass compliance with law and regulation by governmental authority well our own internal review have resulted in and are likely to continue to result in change to our practice product and procedure restitution to our customer and increased cost related to regulatory oversight supervision and examination we have also been subject to regulatory action and may continue to be the subject of such action including governmental inquiry investigation enforcement proceeding and the imposition of fine or civil money penalty in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with law or regulation in addition legislator and regulator in various country in which we operate have focused on the operation of card network including through antitrust action legislation and regulation to change certain practice or pricing of card issuer merchant acquirer and payment network and in some case to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regime for payment system see risk factor legal regulatory and compliance risk for discussion of the potential impact legislative and regulatory change may have on our result of operation and financial condition banking regulation federal and state banking law regulation and policy extensively regulate the company which for purpose of this section refers to american express company bank holding company trs and our bank subsidiary american express national bank aenb both the company and trs are subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision regulation and examination by the federal reserve and aenb is likewise supervised regulated and examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency occ the company and it subsidiary are also subject to the rulemaking enforcement and examination authority of the consumer financial

body in november the federal reserve adopted new rating system for large financial institution such the company which is intended to align with the federal reserve existing supervisory program for large financial institution and which includes component rating for capital planning liquidity risk management and governance and control in august and january the federal reserve proposed related guidance for the governance and control component activity the bhc act generally limit bank holding company to activity that are considered to be banking activity and certain closely related activity noted each of the company and trs is bank holding company and each ha elected to become financial holding company which is authorized to engage in broader range of financial and related activity in order to remain eligible for financial holding company status we must meet certain eligibility requirement those requirement include that each of the company and aenb must be well capitalized and well managed and aenb must have received at least satisfactory rating on it most recent assessment under the community reinvestment act of the cra the company and trs engage in various activity permissible only for financial holding company including in particular providing travel agency service acting finder and engaging in certain insurance underwriting and agency service if the company fails to meet

and it subsidiary are prohibited by law from engaging in practice that the relevant regulatory authority deems unsafe or unsound which such authority generally interpret broadly acquisition and investment applicable federal and state law place limitation on the ability of person to invest in or acquire control of without providing notice to or obtaining the approval of one or more of our regulator in addition we are subject to banking law and regulation that limit our investment and acquisition and in some case subject them to the prior review and approval of our regulator including the federal reserve and the occ federal banking regulator have broad discretion in evaluating proposed acquisition and investment that are subject to their prior review or approval table of content financial regulatory reform the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank and the federal reserve implementing regulation impose heightened prudential requirement on bank holding company with at least billion in total consolidated asset such the company that are more stringent than those applicable to smaller bank holding company the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa enacted in may preserve the fundamental element of the post dodd frank regulatory framework but among other thing revise certain aspect of the financial regulatory regime for bank holding company with le than billion in total consolidated asset such the company under dodd frank federal banking regulator were required to apply enhanced prudential standard to bank holding company such the company with total consolidated asset of billion or more following the enactment of egrrcpa effective november federal banking regulator will no longer be required to apply most dodd frank enhanced prudential standard to bank holding company such the company with total consolidated asset of billion but le than billion for example holding company resolution planning and company run stress testing would no longer be mandatory and supervisory stress testing which is currently conducted annually would be conducted on periodic basis depository institution such aenb with total consolidated asset billion and billion will also not be required to conduct annual company run stress test effective november much of the dodd frank enhanced prudential standard were implemented by the federal banking regulator through regulation egrrcpa however doe not amend those regulation which will require action by the federal banking regulator additionally egrrcpa permit the federal reserve by order or rule to apply enhanced prudential standard to bank holding company such the company with total consolidated asset of billion or more lastly there are several regulation not directly affected by egrrcpa but that federal banking regulator may modify to conform to the new higher asset threshold such the comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar process in october the federal reserve released two proposal one jointly with the occ and the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and one on it own that would tailor the applicable capital and liquidity requirement and prudential standard for large banking organization such the company based on their size and other risk based indicator consistent with egrrcpa the tailoring proposal the tailoring proposal are not yet final and may be modified prior to their final adoption by the federal reserve the occ and the fdic the tailoring proposal would assign each bank holding company with billion or more in total consolidated asset well it bank subsidiary to one of four category based on it size and five risk based indicator cross jurisdictional activity ii weighted short term wholesale funding iii non bank asset iv off balance sheet exposure and status global systemically important banking organization the federal reserve indicated which firm would fall into each of the four category based on data for the second quarter of with the company in category iv firm subject to category iv standard would generally be subject to the capital and liquidity requirement firm with under billion in total consolidated asset but would also be required to monitor and report certain risk based indicator result under the tailoring proposal category iv firm such the company would no longer be subject to the advanced approach capital requirement ii no longer be subject to the supplementary leverage ratio iii no longer be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer iv no longer be subject to company run stress testing requirement become subject to supervisory stress testing on an every other year basis rather than an annual basis and vi no longer be subject to the liquidity coverage ratio or the proposed net stable funding ratio minimum requirement the ultimate impact from egrrcpa and the related regulatory change is subject to the final implementing regulation adopted by federal banking regulator which may differ from the proposal described herein stress testing and capital planning under the federal reserve regulation the company is currently subject to annual supervisory and semiannual company run stress testing requirement that are designed to evaluate whether bank holding company ha sufficient capital on total consolidated basis to absorb loss and support operation under adverse economic condition under the tailoring proposal category iv firm such the company would no longer be subject to company run stress testing requirement but would remain subject to the quantitative review of their capital plan under ccar which the federal reserve ha indicated it plan to conduct on an every other year instead of annual basis for category iv firm in connection with the release of the tailoring proposal the federal reserve also indicated that it expects to revise it guidance on capital planning to align with the proposed category of standard set forth in the tailoring proposal we continue to evaluate the impact of the tailoring proposal and forthcoming related proposal on the company and it capital planning process the result of the company stress testing are incorporated into our annual capital plan which must cover planning horizon of at least nine quarter and which we are required to submit to the federal reserve for review under it ccar process part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether the company ha sufficient capital to continue operation under various scenario of economic and financial market stress developed by both the company and the federal reserve including taking into account planned capital distribution such dividend payment and common stock repurchase sufficient capital for these purpose is likely to require to maintain capital ratio appreciably above applicable minimum requirement and buffer the scenario are designed to stress our risk and vulnerability and ass our pro forma capital position and ratio under hypothetical stress environment we are required to submit our capital plan and stress testing result to the federal reserve on or april of each year in which they are required the federal reserve is expected to publish the decision for all the bank holding company participating in ccar including the reason for any objection to capital plan by june of each year in addition the federal reserve will publish separately the result of it supervisory stress test under the supervisory severely adverse scenario the information to be released will include among other thing the federal reserve projection of company specific information including post stress capital ratio information over the planning horizon we may be required to revise and resubmit our capital plan required by the federal reserve following certain event such significant acquisition in addition to other limitation our ability to make any capital distribution including dividend and share repurchase is contingent on the federal reserve non objection to our capital plan on february the federal reserve announced that certain firm with total consolidated asset between billion and billion such the company would not be subject to supervisory stress testing company run stress testing or ccar for the cycle the federal reserve stated that permitted capital distribution for the cycle for such firm would be largely based on the result of the supervisory stress test we remain subject to the requirement to develop and maintain an annual capital plan table of content dividend and other capital distribution the company and trs well aenb and the company insurance and other regulated subsidiary are limited in their ability to pay dividend by statute regulation and supervisory policy dividend payment by the company to shareholder are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve see stress testing and capital planning even if the federal reserve ha not objected to distribution the company may still not make distribution without federal reserve approval if among other thing the company would not meet minimum regulatory capital ratio after giving effect to the capital distribution change in fact would require resubmission of our capital plan or the company earnings are materially underperforming it projection in the capital plan in general federal law and regulation prohibit without first obtaining the occ approval aenb from making dividend distribution to trs if such distribution are not paid out of available recent earnings or would cause aenb to fail to meet capital adequacy standard in addition to specific limitation on the dividend aenb can pay to trs federal banking regulator have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividend if in the banking regulator opinion payment of dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the institution capital leverage and liquidity regulation capital rule the company and aenb are required to comply with the applicable capital adequacy rule established by federal banking regulator these rule are intended to ensure that bank holding company and depository institution collectively banking organization have adequate capital given their level of asset and off balance sheet obligation the federal banking regulator current capital rule which subject to phase in provision generally became applicable to the company and aenb predecessor institution in the capital rule largely implement the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee framework for strengthening international capital regulation known basel iii the minimum capital and buffer requirement under the capital rule have been fully phased in of january for additional information regarding our capital ratio see consolidated capital resource and liquidity under md under the capital rule banking organization are required to maintain minimum ratio for common equity tier tier capital that is plus additional tier capital and total capital that is tier capital plus tier capital to risk weighted asset since we have reported our capital adequacy ratio on parallel basis to federal banking regulator using both risk weighted asset calculated under the basel iii standardized approach adjusted for certain item and the requirement for an advanced approach institution during this parallel period federal banking regulator ass our compliance with the advanced approach requirement the parallel period will continue we receive regulatory notification to exit parallel reporting at which point we will begin publicly reporting regulatory risk based capital ratio calculated under both the advanced approach and the standardized approach under the capital rule and will be required to use the lower of these ratio in order to determine whether we are in compliance with minimum capital and buffer requirement for the company and aenb depending on the advanced approach are ultimately implemented for our asset type our capital ratio calculated under the advanced approach may be lower than under the standardized approach the standardized approach is currently the applicable measurement used in ccar in december the basel committee published standard that among other thing revise the standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weight and introducing additional capital requirement for certain unconditionally cancellable commitment such unused credit card line of credit and provide new standardized calculation for operational risk capital requirement if adopted in the united state issued by the basel committee and applicable to the new standard could result in higher capital requirement for the company and aenb must each maintain tier capital and total capital ratio of at least percent percent and percent respectively the capital rule also implement percent capital conservation buffer composed entirely of on top of these minimum risk weighted asset ratio result the minimum ratio are effectively percent percent and percent for the tier capital and total capital ratio respectively of january the required minimum capital ratio for the company may be further increased by countercyclical capital buffer composed entirely of up to percent which may be assessed federal banking regulator determine that such buffer is necessary to protect the banking system from disorderly downturn associated with excessively expansionary period subject to adjustment by the federal reserve the current countercyclical capital buffer is zero percent assuming the maximum countercyclical capital buffer wa in place the company effective minimum tier capital and total capital ratio could be percent percent and percent respectively table of content banking institution whose ratio of tier capital or total capital to risk weighted asset is above the minimum but the capital conservation buffer or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer when the latter is applied will face constraint on discretionary distribution such dividend repurchase and redemption of capital security and executive compensation based on the amount of the shortfall and the institution eligible retained income that is four quarter trailing net income net of distribution and tax effect not reflected in net income noted above category iv firm such the company would no longer be subject to the countercyclical capital buffer requirement under the tailoring proposal the federal reserve proposed rule in april that would among other thing replace the static percent capital conservation buffer with stress capital buffer requirement for bank holding company subject to the ccar process the stress capital buffer would reflect stressed loss in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the federal reserve ccar stress test and would also include four quarter of planned common stock dividend the proposal also included stress leverage buffer requirement similar to the stress capital buffer which would apply to the tier leverage ratio the proposal would require bank holding company to reduce their planned capital distribution if those distribution would not be consistent with the applicable capital buffer constraint based on the bank holding company own baseline scenario projection the federal reserve ha indicated that it intends to propose revision to the stress buffer requirement that would be applicable to category iv firm such the company to align with the proposed two year supervisory stress testing cycle for category iv bank holding company leverage requirement we are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirement the leverage ratio is the ratio of banking organization tier capital to it average total consolidated asset defined for regulatory purpose all banking organization are required to maintain leverage ratio of at least percent the capital rule also establish supplementary leverage ratio slr requirement for advanced approach banking organization such the company the slr is the ratio of tier capital to an expanded concept of leverage exposure that includes both on balance sheet and certain off balance sheet exposure the capital rule require minimum slr of percent noted above category iv firm such the company would no longer be subject to the slr requirement under the tailoring proposal liquidity regulation the federal reserve enhanced prudential standard rule includes heightened liquidity and overall risk management requirement the rule requires the maintenance of liquidity buffer consisting of highly liquid asset that is sufficient to meet projected net outflow for day over range of liquidity stress scenario in addition the company and aenb are currently subject to liquidity coverage ratio lcr requirement which is provided for in the basel iii liquidity framework and is designed to ensure that banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid asset that can be converted into cash to meet it liquidity need for day time horizon under an acute liquidity stress scenario specified by supervisor the lcr measure the ratio of firm high quality liquid asset to it projected net outflow the company and aenb are required to calculate the lcr each business day maintain minimum ratio of percent and disclose certain lcr calculation data and other information on quarterly basis second standard provided for in the basel iii liquidity framework referred to the net stable funding ratio nsfr requires minimum amount of longer term funding based on the asset and activity of banking entity the lcr and nsfr requirement may cause banking entity generally to increase their holding of cash treasury security and other sovereign debt proportion of total asset and or increase the proportion of longer term debt federal banking regulator issued proposed rule in may that would implement the nsfr for advanced approach banking organization such the company final rule ha not yet been issued and timing for implementation of the nsfr requirement is uncertain if implemented proposed the rule would require that available stable funding be no le than required stable funding for the company and aenb each such measure is calculated under the rule noted above category iv firm such the company and aenb would no longer be subject to the lcr requirement or the proposed nsfr requirement under the tailoring proposal table of content prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance act fdia requires among other thing that federal banking regulator take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institution insured by the fdic such aenb that do not meet minimum capital requirement the fdia establishes five capital category for fdic insured bank well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized the fdia imposes progressively more restrictive constraint on operation management and capital distribution depending on the capital category in which an institution is classified in order to be considered well capitalized aenb must maintain tier capital total capital and tier leverage ratio of percent percent percent and percent respectively under the fdia aenb could be prohibited from accepting brokered deposit deposit raised through third party brokerage network or offering interest rate on any deposit significantly higher than the prevailing rate in it normal market area or nationally depending upon where the deposit are solicited unless it is well capitalized or it is adequately capitalized and receives waiver from the fdic significant amount of our outstanding retail deposit are considered brokered deposit for bank regulatory purpose if federal regulator determines that we are in an unsafe or unsound condition or that we are engaging in unsafe or unsound banking practice the regulator may reclassify our capital category or otherwise place restriction on our ability to accept or solicit brokered deposit resolution planning the company is required to prepare and provide to regulator plan for it rapid and orderly resolution under the bankruptcy code in the event of material distress or failure this resolution planning requirement may practical matter present additional constraint on our structure operation and business strategy and on transaction and business arrangement between our bank and non bank subsidiary because we must consider the impact of these matter on our ability to prepare and submit resolution plan that demonstrates that we may be resolved under the bankruptcy code in rapid and orderly manner if the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the company plan is not credible and we fail to cure the deficiency we may be subject to more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirement may be subject to more restriction on our growth activity

it asset including share of it operating subsidiary and potentially limited liability to bridge holding company utilize the resource of the failed financial holding company to recapitalize the operating subsidiary and satisfy the claim of unsecured creditor of the failed financial holding company and other claimant in the receivership by delivering security of one or more new financial

performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmation or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of aenb in addition the claim of holder of deposit liability and certain claim for administrative expense of the fdic against aenb would be afforded priority over other general unsecured claim against aenb including claim of debt holder and depositor in non office in the liquidation or other resolution of aenb result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligation of aenb the debt holder and depositor

with certain federal consumer financial law are supervised and examined by the cfpb which ha broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over provider of credit saving and payment service and product

than federal law federal law also regulates abusive debt collection practice which along with bankruptcy and debtor relief law can affect our ability to collect amount owed to or subject to regulatory scrutiny we are also regulated in the united state under the money transmitter or sale of check law in effect in most state in addition we are required by the law of many state to comply with unclaimed and abandoned property law under which we must pay to state the face amount of any traveler cheque or prepaid card that is uncashed or unredeemed after period of time depending on the type of product table of content in country outside the united state we have seen an increase in regulatory focus in relation to number of key area impacting our card issuing business particularly consumer protection such in the european union eu the united kingdom and canada and responsible lending such in australia mexico new zealand and singapore regulator in number of country are shifting their focus from ensuring compliance with local rule and regulation toward paying greater attention to the product design and operation with focus on customer and outcome regulator expectation of firm in relation to their compliance risk and control framework continue to increase and regulator are placing significant emphasis on firm system and control relating to the identification and resolution of issue payment regulation legislator and regulator in various country in which we operate have focused on the operation of card network including through antitrust action legislation and regulation to change certain practice or pricing of card issuer merchant acquirer and payment network and in some case to establish broad and ongoing regulatory oversight regime for payment system the eu australia and other jurisdiction have focused on the fee merchant pay to accept card including the way bankcard network member collectively set the interchange that is the fee paid by the bankcard merchant acquirer to the card issuer in four party network like visa and mastercard well the rule contract term and practice governing merchant card acceptance for example in december the european commission announced that it is taking comment on separate proposal by visa and mastercard to cap inter regional multilateral interchange fee regulation and other governmental action relating to merchant pricing or term of merchant rule and contract could affect all network directly or indirectly well adversely impact consumer and merchant among other thing regulation of bankcard fee ha negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn including result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decrease in competitor pricing in connection with cap on interchange fee in some case regulation also extend to certain aspect of our business and we have largely exited our network business in the eu and australia result of regulation in those jurisdiction for example in various country such certain member state in the eu and australia merchant are permitted by law to surcharge card purchase in addition the law of number of state in the united state that prohibit surcharging have been challenged in litigation brought by merchant group and some such law have been overturned surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have material adverse effect on if it becomes widespread particularly where it only or disproportionately impact our business in addition other steering practice that are permitted by regulation in some country could also have material adverse effect on if they become widespread in canada regulator have prompted the major international card network to make voluntary commitment on pricing specifically interchange fee level american express doe not operate with interchange fee in canada our commitment extend to maintaining current pricing practice and complying with certain other practice in some country government have established regulatory regime that require international card network to be locally licensed and or to localize aspect of their operation for example card network operator in india must obtain authorization from the reserve bank of india which ha broad power under the payment and settlement system act to regulate the membership and operation of card network in russia card network operator must be authorized by the central bank and regulation requires network to place security deposit with the central bank process all local transaction using government owned infrastructure and ensure that local transaction data remains within the country the development and enforcement of these and other similar law regulation and policy may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in

circumstance described in the risk and uncertainty occur or continue to occur these event or circumstance could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition or result of operation these event could also have negative effect on the trading price of our security strategic business and competitive risk difficult condition in the business and economic environment well political condition in the united state and elsewhere may materially adversely affect our business and result of operation our result of operation are materially affected by economic market political and social condition in the united state and abroad we offer broad array of product and service to consumer small business and commercial client and thus are very dependent upon the level of consumer and business activity and the demand for payment and financing product slow economic growth volatile or deteriorating economic condition or shift in broader consumer and business trend could change customer behavior including spending on our card the ability and willingness of card member to borrow and pay amount owed to and demand for fee based product and service political condition prolonged or recurring government shutdown regional hostility social upheaval fiscal and monetary policy trade concern and tariff could also negatively affect consumer and business spending including travel pattern and business investment and demand for credit factor such consumer spending and confidence unemployment rate business investment government spending trade relationship with other country interest rate tax energy cost the volatility and strength of the capital market inflation and deflation all affect the economic environment and ultimately our profitability such factor may also cause our earnings billing loan balance credit metric and margin to fluctuate and diverge from expectation of analyst and investor who may have differing assumption regarding their impact on our business adversely affecting and or increasing the volatility of the trading price of our common share table of content travel and entertainment expenditure which comprised approximately percent of our billed business during for example are sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending level and tend to decline during general economic downturn likewise spending by small business and corporate client which comprised approximately percent of our worldwide billed business during depends in part on the economic environment and favorable climate for continued business investment and new business formation increase in delinquency and write off rate result of increase in bankruptcy unemployment rate change in customer behavior or otherwise could also have material adverse effect on our result of operation the consequence of negative circumstance impacting or the environment generally can be sudden and severe the exit of the united kingdom from the european union could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition our business in the united kingdom and elsewhere may be negatively impacted by the uncertainty regarding the exit of the united kingdom from the european union commonly referred to brexit including from deterioration of consumer and business activity in the united kingdom and other country and general uncertainty in the overall business environment in which we operate the exit itself could negatively impact the united kingdom and other economy which could adversely affect spending on our card and the ability and willingness of card member to pay amount owed to we may also experience increased volatility in the value of the pound sterling the euro and other european currency which could further strengthen the dollar adversely impacting the result of operation from our international activity in addition brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national law and regulation in the united kingdom and the european union and we may incur additional cost or need to make operational change that reduce revenue we adapt to potentially divergent regulatory framework any of these effect of brexit among others could adversely affect our business and financial result of december the united kingdom constituted approximately percent of our worldwide billed business and the emea region whole constituted approximately percent we have made change to the structure of our business operation in europe in anticipation of brexit although the financial trade and legal implication of brexit are still uncertain and may be more severe than expected given that the final term upon which the united kingdom will exit the eu are still not known and the lack of comparable precedent our operating result may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in the payment industry the payment industry is highly competitive and we compete with charge credit and debit card network issuer and acquirer paper based transaction cash and check bank transfer model wire transfer and ach well evolving and growing alternative non traditional payment and financing provider if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor develop compelling value proposition for our customer and or effectively grow in area such mobile and online payment and emerging technology we may not be able to compete effectively we believe visa and mastercard are larger than we are in most country result card issuer and acquirer on the visa and mastercard network may be able to benefit from the dominant position scale resource marketing and pricing of those network our business may also be increasingly negatively affected if we are unable to increase merchant acceptance and our card are not accepted at merchant that accept card on the visa and mastercard network some of our competitor have developed or may develop substantially greater financial and other resource than we have and may offer richer value proposition or wider range of program and service than we offer or may use more effective advertising marketing or cross selling strategy to acquire and retain more customer capture greater share of spending and borrowing establish and develop more attractive cobrand card and other partner program and maintain greater merchant acceptance than we have we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat or respond or adapt to change in consumer spending habit effectively our competitor we expect expense such card member reward and card member service expense to continue to increase we improve our value proposition for card member including in response to increased competition spending on our card could continue to be impacted by increasing consumer usage of charge credit and debit card issued on other network well adoption of alternative payment system to the extent other payment mechanism system and product continue to successfully expand our discount revenue and our ability to access transaction data through our integrated network could be negatively impacted for example company that control access to consumer and merchant payment method choice at the point of sale or through digital wallet commerce related experience mobile application or other technology could choose not to accept suppress use of or degrade the experience of using our product or could restrict our access to our customer and transaction data such company could also require payment from to participate in such digital wallet experience or application impacting our profitability on transaction the competitive value of our closed loop data may also be diminished traditional and non traditional competitor use other new data source and technology to derive similar insight certain regulation such in europe and open banking initiative in various jurisdiction around the world could also diminish the value of our closed loop data or the demand for our product and service by disintermediating existing financial service provider table of content to the extent we expand into new business area and new geographic region we may face competitor with more experience and more established relationship with relevant customer regulator and industry participant which could adversely affect our ability to compete law and business practice that favor local competitor require card transaction to be routed over domestic network or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of certain business could limit our growth in international region we may face additional compliance and regulatory risk to the extent that we expand into new business area and we may need to dedicate more expense time and resource to comply with regulatory requirement than our competitor particularly those that are not regulated financial institution many of our competitor are subject to different and in some case le stringent legislative and regulatory regime and some may have lower cost structure and more agile business model and system more restrictive law and regulation that do not apply to all of our competitor can put at disadvantage including prohibiting from engaging in certain transaction regulating our business practice or adversely affecting our cost structure we face intense competition for partner relationship which could result in loss or renegotiation of these arrangement that could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation in the ordinary course of our business we enter into different type of contractual arrangement with business partner in variety of industry for example we have partnered with delta air line well many others globally to offer cobranded card for consumer and small business and through our membership reward program we have partnered with business in many industry including the airline industry to offer benefit to card member participant competition for relationship with key business partner is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationship or that they will remain profitable establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnership is particularly competitive among card issuer and network these partnership typically appeal to high spending loyal customer all of our cobrand portfolio in the aggregate accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december card member loan related to our cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide card member loan of december we have partnered with delta air line across many aspect of our business we issue card under cobrand arrangement with delta and the delta cobrand portfolio our largest cobrand portfolio accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december and approximately percent of worldwide card member loan of december the delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from card member and discount revenue from delta and other merchant for spending on delta cobrand card our relationship with and revenue related to delta are significant and extend beyond cobrand account delta is key participant in our membership reward program provides travel related benefit and service including airport lounge access for certain american express card member accepts american express card merchant and is corporate payment customer cobrand arrangement are entered into for fixed period generally ranging from five to eight year and will terminate in accordance with their term including at the end of the fixed period unless extended or renewed at the option of the party or upon early termination result of an event of default or otherwise we work with our cobrand partner on an ongoing basis to demonstrate the value we deliver and evolve our relationship for the benefit of both party we face the risk that we could lose partner relationship even after we have invested significant resource in the relationship we may also choose to not renew certain cobrand relationship the volume of billed business could decline and card member attrition could increase in each case significantly result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationship in addition some of our cobrand arrangement provide that upon expiration or termination the cobrand partner may purchase or designate third party to purchase the loan generated with respect to it program which could result in the loss of the card account and significant decline in our card member loan outstanding we regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangement in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationship will be renegotiated with le favorable term for or that we may be unable to renegotiate on term that are acceptable to competition for such relationship continues to increase we make payment to our cobrand partner which can be significant based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding reward earned on such spending and under certain arrangement on the number of account acquired and retained the amount we pay to our cobrand partner ha increased particularly in the united state and may continue to increase arrangement are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partner among card issuer and network see off balance sheet arrangement and contractual obligation under md for additional information regarding commitment for payment to certain cobrand partner the loss of exclusivity arrangement with business partner the loss of the partner relationship altogether whether by non renewal at the end of the contract period such the end of our relationship with costco in the united state in or the result of merger legal or regulatory action or otherwise such the withdrawal of american airline in from our airport club access program for centurion and platinum card member or the renegotiation of existing partnership with term that are significantly worse for could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation see our business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationship in the eu in addition any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partner could harm our reputation making it more difficult to attract and retain card member and merchant and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partner table of content we face continued intense competitive pressure that may impact the price we charge merchant that accept our card for payment for good and service unlike our competitor in the payment industry that rely on revolving credit balance to drive profit our business model is more focused on card member spending discount revenue which represents fee generally charged to merchant when card member use their card to purchase good and service on our network is primarily driven by billed business volume and is our largest single revenue source in recent year we experienced some reduction in our average merchant discount rate including result of rate pressure resulting from regulatory change affecting competitor pricing in certain international country we also face pressure from competitor that have other source of income or lower cost that can make their pricing more attractive to business partner and merchant merchant are also able to negotiate incentive and pricing concession from condition to accepting our card or being cobrand partner merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentive and or concession we provide to such merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive we have also experienced erosion of our average merchant discount rate we increase merchant acceptance we may not be successful in significantly expanding merchant acceptance or offsetting rate erosion with volume at new merchant in addition the regulatory environment and differentiated payment model and technology from non traditional player in the alternative payment space could pose challenge to our traditional payment model and adversely impact our average merchant discount rate some merchant continue to invest in their own payment solution such proprietary branded mobile wallet using both traditional and new technology platform if merchant are able to drive broad consumer adoption and usage it could adversely impact our average merchant discount rate and billed business volume continuing priority of is to drive greater and differentiated value to our merchant which if not successful could negatively impact our discount revenue and financial result we may not succeed in maintaining merchant discount rate or offsetting the impact of declining merchant discount rate which could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability and therefore our ability to invest in innovation and in value added service for merchant and card member surcharging or steering by merchant could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation in certain country such australia and certain member state in the eu merchant are expressly permitted by law to surcharge certain card purchase in jurisdiction allowing surcharging we have seen merchant surcharging on american express card in certain merchant category and in some case either the surcharge is greater than that applied to visa and mastercard card or visa and mastercard card are not surcharged at all practice that are known differential surcharging even though there are many card issued on competing network that have an equal or greater cost of acceptance for the merchant in addition the law of number of state in the united state that prohibit surcharging have been overturned in litigation brought by merchant group we also encounter merchant that accept our card but tell their customer that they prefer to accept another type of payment or otherwise seek to suppress use of our card our card member value the ability to use their card where and when they want to and we therefore take step to meet our card member expectation and to protect the american express brand by prohibiting this form of discrimination subject to local legal requirement if surcharging steering or other form of discrimination become widespread american express card and credit and charge card generally could become le desirable to consumer which could result in decrease in card in force and transaction volume the impact could vary depending on such factor the industry or manner in which surcharge is levied how card member are steered to other card product or payment form at the point of sale the size and recurrence of the underlying charge and whether and to what extent these action are applied to other form of payment including whether it varies depending on the type of card product network acquirer or issuer discrimination against american express card could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation particularly to the extent it disproportionately impact our card member or our business we may not be successful in our effort to promote card usage through marketing and promotion merchant acceptance and card member reward and service or to effectively control the cost of such investment both of which may impact our profitability revenue growth is dependent on increasing consumer and business spending on our card growing loan balance and increasing fee revenue we have been investing in number of growth initiative including to attract new card member reduce card member attrition and capture greater share of customer total spending and borrowing there can be no assurance that our investment to acquire card member provide differentiated feature and service and increase usage of our card will continue to be effective in addition if we develop new product or offer that attract customer looking for short term incentive rather than incentivize long term loyalty card member attrition and cost could increase increasing spending on our card also depends on our continued expansion of merchant acceptance of our card if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows or revers itself our business could suffer further expanding our service offering adding customer acquisition channel and forming new partnership or renewing current partnership could have higher cost than our current arrangement and could adversely impact our average discount rate or dilute our brand table of content another way we invest in customer value is through our membership reward program well other card member benefit any significant change in or failure by management to reasonably estimate actual redemption of membership reward point and associated redemption cost could adversely affect our profitability we rely on third party such amazon and delta for certain redemption option and may not be able to continue to offer such redemption option in the future which could diminish the value of the program for our card member in addition many credit card issuer have instituted reward and cobrand program and may introduce program and service that are similar to or more attractive than ours our inability to continue to differentiate our product and service generally could materially adversely affect we may not be able to cost effectively manage and expand card member benefit including containing the growth of marketing promotion reward and card member service expense in the future if such expense continue to increase beyond our expectation we will need to find way to offset the financial impact by increasing payment volume increasing other area of revenue such fee based revenue or both we may not succeed in so particularly in the current competitive and regulatory environment our brand and reputation are key asset of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace our brand and it attribute are key asset and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to preserve grow and leverage the value of our brand our ability to attract and retain consumer and small business card member and corporate client is highly dependent upon the external perception of our level of service trustworthiness business practice data use and protection management workplace culture merchant acceptance financial condition our response to unexpected event and other subjective quality negative perception or publicity regarding these matter even if related to seemingly isolated incident and whether or not factually correct could erode trust and confidence and damage our reputation among existing and potential card member and corporate client which could make it difficult for to attract new card member and customer and maintain existing one negative public opinion could result from actual or alleged conduct in any number of activity or circumstance including card practice regulatory compliance the use and protection of customer information and conduct by our employee and from action taken by regulator or others in response thereto social medium channel can also cause rapid widespread reputational harm to our brand our brand and reputation may also be harmed by action taken by third party that are outside our control for example any shortcoming of or controversy related to third party vendor business partner merchant acquirer or network partner may be attributed by card member and merchant to thus damaging our reputation and brand value the lack of acceptance suppression of card usage or surcharging by merchant can also negatively impact perception of our brand and our product lower overall transaction volume and increase the attractiveness of other payment product or system adverse development with respect to our industry may also by association negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against furthermore corporation with headquarters and operation located in the united state negative perception of the united state arising from it political or other position could harm the perception of our company and our brand although we monitor development for area of potential risk to our reputation and brand negative perception or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability major information or cyber security incident or an increase in fraudulent activity could lead to reputational damage to our brand and significant legal regulatory and financial exposure and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and credit card we and third party process transmit store and provide access to account information in connection with our charge and credit card and other product and in the normal course of our business we collect analyze and retain significant volume of certain type of personally

institution like have experienced significant increase in information and cyber security risk in recent year and will likely continue to be the target of increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks including computer virus malicious or destructive code ransomware social engineering attack including phishing impersonation and identity takeover attempt hacking website defacement denial of service

distributed denial of service attack from sophisticated third party table of content we develop and maintain system and process aimed at detecting and preventing information and cyber security incident and fraudulent activity which require significant investment maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating technology and regulatory requirement change and effort to overcome security measure become more sophisticated despite our effort the possibility of information and cyber security incident malicious social engineering fraudulent or other malicious activity and human error or malfeasance can not be eliminated entirely and will evolve new technology is deployed risk associated with each of these include theft of fund and other monetary loss the disruption of our operation and the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse modification loss or destruction of confidential proprietary or other information including account data information the effect of which could be compounded if not detected quickly information or cyber security incident fraudulent activity and other actual or perceived failure to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security may lead to regulatory investigation and intervention such mandatory card reissuance increased litigation including class action litigation remediation fine and response cost negative assessment of and our subsidiary by banking regulator and rating agency reputational and financial damage to our brand and reduced usage and acceptance of our card all of which could have material adverse impact on our business the disclosure of sensitive company information could also undermine our competitive advantage and divert management attention and resource successful cyberattacks data breach disruption or other incident related to the actual or perceived failure to maintain confidentiality integrity privacy and or security at other large financial institution large retailer travel and hospitality company or other market participant whether or not we are impacted could lead to general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measure or harming the reputation of the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of our product and service such event could also result in legislation and additional regulatory requirement although we have insurance for loss related to cyber risk and attack and information and cyber security and privacy liability it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of material loss event the uninterrupted operation of our information system is critical to our success and significant disruption could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation our information technology system including our transaction authorization clearing and settlement system and data center may experience service disruption or degradation because of technology malfunction sudden increase in customer transaction volume natural disaster accident power outage internet outage telecommunication failure fraud denial of service and other cyberattacks terrorism computer virus vulnerability in hardware or software physical or electronic break in or similar event service disruption could prevent access to our online service and account information compromise or limit access to company or customer data and impede transaction processing and financial reporting any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of our product and service and materially adversely affect our overall business reputation and result of operation we rely on third party provider for acquiring customer technology platform and other service integral to the operation of our business these third party may act in way that could harm our business we rely on third party service provider merchant customer acquisition channel processor aggregator network partner and other third party for service that are integral to our operation and are subject to the risk that activity of such third party may adversely affect our business outsourcing specialization of function third party digital service and technology innovation within the payment industry increase including with respect to mobile technology tokenization big data and cloud storage solution more third party are involved in processing card transaction and handling our data for example we rely on third party for the timely transmission of accurate information across our global network card acquisition and provision of service to our customer if service provider or other third party cease to provide the data quality or communication capacity we expect or service upon which we rely result of natural disaster operational disruption or error terrorism information or cyber security incident or any other reason the

third party network or platform or held by or accessible to third party including merchant that accept our card payment processor payment intermediary and our third party vendor and business partner could become compromised which could lead to unauthorized use of our data or fraudulent transaction on our card well cost associated with responding to such an incident for example in march we were alerted by expedia that certain customer who used expedia orbitz platform may have been victim of cyberattack the attack involved an orbitz platform that served the underlying booking engine for online travel website including amextravel com and travel booked through amex travel representative we are also exposed to the risk that disruption or other event at third party affecting one of our service provider or partner could impede their ability to provide to service or data on which we rely to operate our business service provider or other third party could also cease providing data to if we are unable to negotiate for data use right or use our data for purpose that do not benefit which could diminish the competitive value of our closed loop the management of multiple vendor increase our operational complexity and decrease our control failure to exercise adequate oversight over service provider including compliance with service level agreement or regulatory or legal requirement could result in regulatory action fine sanction or economic and reputational harm to in addition we may not be able to effectively monitor or mitigate operational risk relating to our vendor service provider table of content we have agreement with business partner in variety of industry including the airline industry that represent significant portion of our business we are exposed to risk associated with these industry including bankruptcy liquidation restructurings consolidation and alliance of our partner and the possible obligation to make payment to our partner we may be obligated to make or accelerate payment to certain business partner such cobrand partner upon the occurrence of certain triggering event such shortfall in certain performance and revenue level if we are not able to effectively manage these triggering event we could unexpectedly have to make payment to these partner which could have negative effect on our financial condition and result of operation similarly we are exposed to risk from bankruptcy liquidation insolvency financial distress restructurings consolidation and other similar event that may occur in any industry representing significant portion of our billed business which could negatively impact particular card product and service and billed business generally and our financial condition and result of operation for example we could be materially impacted if we were obligated to or elected to reimburse card member for product and service purchased from merchant that have ceased operation or stopped accepting our card we are exposed to credit risk in the airline industry to the extent we protect card member against non delivery of good and service such where we have remitted payment to an airline for card member purchase of ticket that have not yet been used or flown if we are unable to collect the amount from the airline we may bear the loss for the amount credited to the card member spending at airline merchant accounted for approximately percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended december for additional information relating to the general risk related to the airline industry see risk management institutional credit risk exposure to the airline and travel industry under md if we are not able to invest successfully in and compete at the leading edge of technological development across all our business our revenue and profitability could be negatively affected our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change in order to compete in our industry we need to continue to invest in technology across all area of our business including in transaction processing data management and analytics machine learning and artificial intelligence customer interaction and communication alternative payment mechanism authentication technology and risk management and compliance system incorporating new technology into our product and service may require substantial expenditure and take considerable time and ultimately may not be successful we expect that new technology in the payment industry will continue to emerge and these new technology may be superior to or render obsolete our existing technology the process of developing new product and service enhancing existing product and service and adapting to technological change and evolving industry standard is complex costly and uncertain and any failure by to anticipate customer changing need and emerging technological trend accurately could significantly impede our ability to compete effectively consumer and merchant adoption is key competitive factor and our competitor may develop product platform or technology that become more widely adopted than ours in addition we may underestimate the time and expense we must invest in new product and service before they generate material revenue if at all our ability to develop acquire or access competitive technology or business process on acceptable term may also be limited by intellectual property right that third party including competitor and potential competitor may assert in addition our ability to adopt new technology may be inhibited by the emergence of industry wide standard changing legislative and regulatory environment the need for internal product and engineering expertise resistance to change from card member or merchant or the complexity of our system we may not be successful in realizing the benefit associated with our acquisition strategic alliance joint venture and investment activity and our business and reputation could be negatively impacted we have acquired number of business and have made number of strategic investment and continue to evaluate potential transaction these transaction could be material to our financial condition and result of operation there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully identify and secure future acquisition candidate on term and condition that are acceptable to or successfully complete proposed acquisition and investment which could impair our growth the process of integrating an acquired company business or technology could create unforeseen operating difficulty and expenditure result in unanticipated liability and harm our business generally it may take longer than expected to fully realize the anticipated benefit of these transaction and those benefit may ultimately be smaller than anticipated or may not be realized at all which could adversely affect our business and operating result including result of write down of goodwill and other intangible asset table of content we may also face risk with other type of strategic transaction such the sale to incomm of the operation relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business in the united state the reloadable operation have experienced disruption in the past impacting the ability of our prepaid customer to load and use their card if such operation are interrupted suspended or terminated in the future it could further negatively impact our customer experience result in additional cost litigation and regulatory action and harm our business and reputation joint venture including our gbt jv and minority investment inherently involve lesser degree of control over business operation thereby potentially increasing the financial legal operational and or compliance risk associated with the joint venture or minority investment in addition we may be dependent on joint venture partner controlling shareholder or

ability to pursue certain business opportunity require change to business practice and affect our relationship with partner merchant and card member regulatory oversight and supervision of our business are generally designed to protect consumer and enhance financial stability and are not designed to protect our security holder new law or regulation enhanced supervision effort or change in the enforcement of existing law or regulation applicable to our business could impact the profitability of our business activity limit our ability to pursue business opportunity or adopt new technology require to change certain of our business practice or alter our relationship with partner merchant and card member or affect retention of our key personnel such change also may require to invest significant management attention and resource to make any necessary change and could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition legislator and regulator around the world are aware of each other approach to the regulation of the payment industry consequently development in one country state or region may influence regulatory approach in another to the extent that different regulatory system impose overlapping or inconsistent requirement on the conduct of our business we face complexity and additional cost in our compliance effort if we fail to satisfy regulatory requirement or maintain our financial holding company status our financial condition and result of operation could be adversely affected and we may be restricted in our ability to take certain capital action such declaring dividend or repurchasing outstanding share or engage in certain activity or acquisition additionally our banking regulator have wide discretion in the examination and the enforcement of applicable banking statute and regulation and may restrict our ability to engage in certain activity or acquisition or require to maintain more capital in recent year legislator and regulator have focused on the operation of card network including interchange fee paid to card issuer in payment network such visa and mastercard and the fee merchant are charged to accept card even where we are not directly regulated regulation of bankcard fee can significantly negatively impact the discount revenue derived from our business including result of downward pressure on our discount rate from decrease in competitor pricing in connection with cap on interchange fee in some case regulation also extend to certain aspect of our business such network and cobrand arrangement or term of card acceptance for merchant including term relating to non discrimination and honor all card for example we have largely exited our network business in the eu and australia result of regulation in those jurisdiction in addition there is uncertainty to when or how interchange fee cap and other provision of the eu payment legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partner and agent in the eu in ruling issued on february the eu court of justice confirmed the validity of the application of the fee cap and other provision in circumstance where three party network issue card with cobrand partner or through an agent although the ruling provided only limited guidance to when or how the provision might apply in such circumstance result there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain our cobrand and agent relationship in their current form in the eu we are subject to certain provision of the bank secrecy act amended by the patriot act with regard to maintaining effective aml program similar aml requirement apply under the law of most jurisdiction where we operate increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligation or restriction with respect to the type of product and service we may offer to consumer the country in which our card may be used and the type of customer and merchant who can obtain or accept our card emerging technology such digital currency could limit our ability to track the movement of fund money laundering terrorist financing and other illicit activity involving our card could result in enforcement action and our reputation may suffer due to our customer association with certain country person or entity or the existence of any such transaction various regulatory agency and legislature are also considering regulation and legislation covering identity theft account management guideline credit bureau reporting disclosure rule security and marketing that would impact directly in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting and account management standard these new requirement may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit card or partner with other financial institution which

business business in the financial service and payment industry have historically been subject to significant legal action including class action lawsuit many of these action have included claim for substantial compensatory or punitive damage while we have historically relied on our arbitration clause in agreement with customer to limit our exposure to class action litigation there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in enforcing our arbitration clause in the future and claim of the type we previously arbitrated could be subject to the complexity risk and cost associated with class action case the continued focus of merchant on issue relating to the acceptance of various form of payment may lead to additional litigation and other legal action given the inherent uncertainty involved in litigation and the very large or indeterminate damage sought in some matter asserted against there is significant uncertainty to the ultimate liability we may incur from litigation matter we have been subject to regulatory action and may continue to be subject to such action including governmental inquiry investigation and enforcement proceeding in the event of noncompliance or alleged noncompliance with law or regulation for example we have been cooperating with certain governmental authority that have requested information from or served subpoena on seeking information relating to small specialized part of our business known foreign exchange international payment fxip which offer cross border payment service primarily to small and middle market business customer in five country including the united state in particular we received investigative subpoena from both the civil and criminal division of the department of justice well inquiry from the federal reserve the occ the cfpb the fdic and others fxip account for le than one half of one percent of our total revenue net of interest expense and is unrelated to our card business relatedly we are conducting review with an outside law firm of fxip pricing practice we do not believe this matter will have material adverse impact on our operation or result we expect that regulator will continue taking formal enforcement action against financial institution in addition to addressing supervisory concern through non public supervisory action or finding which could involve restriction on our activity among other limitation that could adversely affect our business in addition violation of law or regulation by another financial institution is likely to give rise to an investigation by regulator and other governmental agency of the same or similar practice by further single event may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigation and proceeding regulatory action could subject to significant fine penalty or other requirement resulting in card member reimbursement increased expense limitation or condition on our business activity and damage to our reputation and our brand which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we are subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rule and if we fail to meet these rule our business would be adversely affected failure to meet current or future capital or liquidity requirement could compromise our competitive position and could result in restriction imposed by the federal reserve including limiting our ability to pay dividend repurchase our capital stock invest in our business expand our business or engage in acquisition some element of the capital and liquidity regime are not yet final and certain development could significantly impact the requirement applicable to financial institution for example the basel committee finalized revision to the standardized approach for credit risk and operational risk capital requirement if these revision are adopted in the united state we could be required to hold significantly more capital result the ultimate impact on our long term capital and liquidity planning and our result of operation is not certain although an increase in our capital and liquid asset level could lower our return on equity part of our required stress testing we must continue to comply with applicable capital standard calculated under the standardized approach in the severely adverse economic scenario published by the federal reserve each year to satisfy these requirement it may be necessary for to hold additional capital in excess of that required by the capital rule compliance with capital adequacy and liquidity rule requires material investment of resource an inability to meet regulatory expectation regarding our compliance with applicable capital adequacy and liquidity rule may also negatively impact the assessment of and our bank subsidiary by federal banking regulator we continue to progress through the parallel run phase of basel iii advanced approach implementation to the extent that the advanced approach requirement apply to our capital ratio calculated under the advanced approach may be lower than under the standardized approach in such case we may need to hold significantly more regulatory capital in order to maintain given

in the event of stressed market environment if the federal reserve object to our capital plan or if we fail to satisfy applicable capital requirement our ability to undertake capital action may be restricted in addition the capital rule include buffer that can be satisfied only with capital if our risk based capital ratio were to fall below the applicable buffer level we would be subject to certain restriction on dividend stock repurchase and other capital distribution well discretionary bonus payment to executive officer our ability to declare or pay dividend on or to purchase redeem or otherwise acquire share of our common stock will be prohibited subject to certain exception in the event that we do not declare and pay in full dividend for the last preceding dividend period of our

that our subsidiary may pay to the parent company for example our bank subsidiary aenb is subject to various statutory and regulatory limitation on it declaration and payment of dividend these limitation may hinder our ability to access fund we may need to make payment on our obligation make dividend payment on outstanding american express company capital stock or otherwise achieve

process credit risk is defined loss due to obligor or counterparty default or change in the credit quality of counterparty or security our credit risk are divided into two broad category individual and institutional each ha distinct risk management capability strategy and tool business unit that create individual or institutional credit risk exposure of significant importance are supported by dedicated risk management team each led by chief credit officer individual credit risk individual credit risk arises from consumer and small business charge card credit card line of credit and term loan these portfolio consist of million of customer across multiple geography industry and level of net worth we benefit from the high quality profile of our customer which is driven by our brand premium customer servicing product feature and risk management capability which span underwriting customer management and collection externally the risk in these portfolio is generally correlated to broad economic trend such unemployment rate and gross domestic product gdp growth the business unit leader and their chief credit officer take the lead in managing the credit risk process these chief credit officer are guided by the individual credit risk committee icrc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the individual credit risk management policy the icrc ensures compliance with ermc guideline and procedure and escalates to the ermc appropriate the individual credit risk management policy is further supported by subordinate policy and operating manual covering

manual are designed to ensure consistent application of risk management principle and standardized reporting of asset quality and loss recognition credit risk management is supported by sophisticated proprietary scoring and decision making model that use up to date information on prospect and customer such spending and payment history and data feed from credit bureau we have developed data driven economic decision logic for customer interaction to better serve our customer institutional credit risk institutional credit risk arises principally within our gc gm gns and foreign exchange service business well investment and liquidity management activity unlike individual credit risk institutional credit risk is characterized by lower loss frequency but higher severity it is affected both by general economic condition and by client specific event the absence of large loss in any given year or over several year is not necessarily representative of the level of risk of institutional portfolio given the infrequency of loss event in such portfolio table of content similar to individual credit risk business unit taking institutional credit risk are supported by chief credit officer these officer are guided by the institutional risk management committee irmc which is responsible for implementation and enforcement of the institutional credit risk management policy and for

travel industry we have multiple important cobrand reward merchant acceptance and corporate payment arrangement with airline the erm program evaluates the risk posed by our airline partner and the overall airline strategy companywide through comprehensive business analysis of global airline and the travel industry more broadly including cruise line travel agency and tour operator our largest airline partner is delta and this relationship includes exclusive cobrand credit card partnership and other arrangement including membership reward redemption merchant acceptance travel and corporate payment see we face intense competition for partner relationship which could result in loss or renegotiation of these arrangement that could have material adverse impact on our business and result of operation under risk factor for additional information debt exposure part of our ongoing risk management process we monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign customer and counterparties and measure and manage concentration of risk by geographic region well by economic sector and industry primary focus area for monitoring is credit deterioration due to weakness in economic and fiscal profile we evaluate country based on the market assessment of the riskiness of their sovereign debt and our assessment of the economic and financial outlook and closely monitor those deemed high risk of december we considered our gross credit exposure to government entity financial institution and corporation in those country deemed high risk to be individually and collectively not material operational risk management process we define operational risk the risk of not achieving business objective due to inadequate or failed process people or information system or the external environment including failure to comply with law and regulation operational risk is inherent in all business activity and can impact an organization through direct or indirect financial loss brand damage customer dissatisfaction or legal and regulatory penalty to appropriately measure and manage operational risk we have implemented comprehensive operational risk framework that is defined in the operational risk management policy approved by the risk committee the operational risk management committee ormc chaired by the chief operational risk officer coordinate with all control group on effective risk assessment and control and oversees the preventive responsive and mitigation effort by operational excellence team in the business unit and staff group we use the operational risk framework to identify measure monitor and report inherent and emerging operational risk this framework supervised by the ormc consists of operational risk event capture project office to coordinate issue management and control enhancement key risk indicator and process and entity level risk assessment the framework requires the assessment of operational risk event to determine root cause impact to customer and or and resolution plan accountability to correct any defect remediate customer and enhance control and testing to mitigate future issue the impact is assessed from an operational financial brand regulatory compliance and legal perspective information and cyber security we have implemented an information security program and operating model that is designed to protect the confidentiality integrity and availability of information and information system from unauthorized access use disclosure disruption modification or destruction our information security program and operating model are based on the national institute of standard and technology nist cybersecurity common standard framework which consist of control designed to identify protect detect respond and recover from information and cyber security incident the framework defines risk and associated control which are embedded in our process and technology those control are measured and monitored by combination of subject matter expert and security operation center with our integrated cyber detection response and recovery capability chaired by the chief information security officer our information security risk management committee sub committee of the ormc provides governance for our information security risk management program the information security and technology oversight team provides independent challenge and assessment of the information cyber security and technology risk management program see major information or cyber security incident or an increase in

transfer confidentiality and retention of personal data our enterprise data governance framework and policy defines governance requirement for data used in critical process compliance risk management process we define compliance risk the risk of legal or reputational harm fine monetary penalty and payment of damage or other form of sanction result of non compliance with applicable law regulation rule or standard of conduct we view our ability to effectively mitigate compliance risk an important aspect of our business model our global compliance and ethic organization is responsible for establishing and maintaining our corporate wide compliance risk management program pursuant to this program we seek to manage and mitigate compliance risk by assessing controlling monitoring measuring and reporting the legal and regulatory risk to which we are exposed the compliance risk management committee crmc chaired by the chief compliance and ethic officer is responsible for identifying

program that monitor and report suspicious activity to the appropriate government authority part of that program the global risk oversight team provides independent risk assessment of the rule used by the anti money laundering team in addition the internal audit group review the process for practice consistent with regulatory guidance reputational risk management process we define reputational risk the risk that negative stakeholder reaction to our product service client and partner relationship business activity and policy management and workplace culture or our response to unexpected event could cause sustained critical medium coverage decline in revenue or investment talent attrition litigation or government or regulatory scrutiny we view protecting our reputation for excellent customer service trust security and high integrity core to our vision of providing the world best customer experience and fundamental to our long term success our business leader are responsible for considering the reputational risk implication of business activity and strategy and ensuring the relevant subject matter expert are engaged needed the ermc is responsible for ensuring reputational risk consideration are included in the scope of appropriate subordinate risk policy and committee and properly reflected in all decision escalated to the ermc market risk management process market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability value resulting from movement in market price our market risk exposure include interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk interest rate risk is driven by the relationship between interest rate on asset such loan receivables and investment security and interest rate on liability such debt and deposit foreign exchange risk arises from transaction funding investment and earnings in currency other than the dollar our asset liability management alm and market risk policy establish the framework that guide and governs market risk management including quantitative limit and escalation trigger these policy are approved by the risk committee of the board of director or market risk management committee market risk is managed by the market risk management committee the market risk oversight officer provides an independent risk assessment and oversight over the policy and exposure management for market risk and alm activity well overseeing compliance with the volcker rule and other regulatory requirement market risk management is also guided and governed by policy covering the use of derivative financial instrument funding liquidity and investment we analyze variety of interest rate scenario to inform of the potential impact from interest rate change on earnings and the value of asset liability and the economic value of equity our interest rate exposure can vary over time result of among other thing the proportion of our total funding provided by variable and fixed rate debt and deposit compared to our card member loan and receivables interest rate swap are used from time to time to effectively convert debt issuance to or from variable rate from or to fixed rate we do not engage in derivative financial instrument for trading purpose other than with respect to our foreign exchange international payment business activity refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for further discussion of our derivative financial instrument table of content of december hypothetical immediate basis point increase in market interest rate would have detrimental effect on our annual net interest income of approximately million this measure first project net interest income over the following twelve month time horizon considering forecasted business growth and anticipated future market interest rate the detrimental impact from rate increase is measured by instantaneously increasing the anticipated future interest rate by basis point it is further assumed that our interest rate sensitive asset and the majority of our liability that reprice within the twelve month horizon generally reprice by basis point our estimated repricing risk assumes that certain deposit liability reprice at lower magnitude than benchmark rate movement consistent with historical deposit repricing experience in the industry and within our own portfolio actual change in our net interest income will depend on many factor and therefore may differ from our estimated risk to change in market interest rate in addition to parallel rate change our net interest income is subject to change in the relationship between market benchmark rate for example movement in prime rate change the yield on large portion of our variable rate lending receivables and loan while libor rate determine the effective interest rate on significant portion of our outstanding funding difference in the rate of change of these two benchmark index commonly referred to basis risk would thus impact our net interest income the detrimental effect on our net interest income of hypothetical basis point decrease in the spread between prime and libor over the next twelve month is estimated to be million we currently have approximately billion of prime based variable rate lending receivables and loan and billion of libor indexed debt including asset securitizations the replacement of libor benchmark rate can have further detrimental impact on our libor indexed debt if rate suddenly rise new market activity transfer to other benchmark curve such the secured overnight financing rate foreign exchange exposure arise in four principal way card member spending in currency that are not the billing currency cross currency transaction and balance from our funding activity cross currency investing activity such in the equity of foreign subsidiary and revenue generated and expense incurred in foreign currency which impact earnings these foreign exchange risk are managed primarily by entering into foreign exchange spot transaction or hedged with foreign exchange forward contract when the hedge cost are economically justified and in notional amount designed to offset pretax impact from currency movement in the period in which they occur of december and foreign currency derivative instrument with total notional amount of approximately billion and billion were outstanding respectively with respect to card member spending and cross currency transaction including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial impact to projected earnings of december with respect to translation exposure of foreign subsidiary equity balance including related foreign exchange forward contract outstanding hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar would result in an immaterial reduction in other comprehensive income and equity of december with respect to earnings denominated in foreign currency the adverse impact on pretax income of hypothetical percent strengthening of the dollar related to anticipated overseas operating result for the next twelve month would be approximately million of december we refined our process to forecast future earnings denominated in foreign currency that resulted in reclassification of certain forecasted expense from dollar to foreign currency the same sensitivity analysis of december using the refined process would have been approximately million to much lesser extent we are also subject to market risk arising from activity conducted by our foreign exchange international payment business we aim to minimize market risk from these activity through hedging where appropriate and the establishment of limit to define and protect the company from excessive exposure the actual impact of interest rate and foreign exchange rate change will depend on among other factor the timing of rate change the extent to which different rate do not move in the same direction or in the same direction to the same degree change in the cost volume and mix of our hedging activity and change in the volume and mix of our business funding liquidity risk management process liquidity risk is defined our inability to meet our ongoing financial and business obligation they become due at reasonable cost our board approved liquidity risk policy establishes the framework that guide and governs liquidity risk management liquidity risk is managed by the funding and liquidity committee in addition the market risk oversight officer provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management we manage liquidity risk by maintaining access to diverse set of cash readily marketable security and contingent source of liquidity such that we can continuously meet our business requirement and expected future financing obligation for at least twelve month period in the event we are unable to raise new fund under our regular funding program during substantial weakening in economic condition we consider the trade offs between maintaining much liquidity which can be costly and limit financial flexibility and having inadequate liquidity which may result in financial distress during liquidity event liquidity risk is managed at an aggregate consolidated level well at certain subsidiary in order to ensure that sufficient and accessible liquidity resource are maintained the funding and liquidity committee review forecast of our aggregate and subsidiary cash position and financing requirement approves funding plan designed to satisfy those requirement under normal and stressed condition establishes guideline to identify the amount of liquidity resource required and monitor position and determines any action to be taken table of content model risk management process we define model risk the risk of adverse consequence such financial loss poor business and strategic decision making or damage to our reputation from decision based on incorrect or misused model output and report we manage model risk through comprehensive model governance framework including policy and procedure for model development independent model validation and change management capability that seek to minimize erroneous model methodology output and misuse we also ass model performance on an ongoing basis strategic and business risk management process strategic and business risk is the risk related to our inability to achieve our business objective due to poor strategic decision including decision related to merger acquisition and divestiture poor implementation of strategic decision or declining demand for our product and service strategic decision are reviewed and approved by business leader and various committee and must be aligned with company policy we seek to manage strategic and business risk through risk control embedded in these process well overall risk management oversight over business goal existing product performance is reviewed periodically by committee and business leader merger acquisition and divestiture can only be approved following deal committee due diligence comprehensive risk assessment by operational market credit and oversight leader provided to the chief risk officer and approval by either the chief risk officer or appropriate risk committee all new product and material change in business process are reviewed and approved by the new product committee and appropriate credit or risk committee table of content critical accounting estimate refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for summary of our significant accounting policy certain of our accounting policy requiring significant management assumption and judgment are follows reserve for card member loss reserve for card member loss represent our best estimate of the probable loss inherent in our outstanding portfolio of card member loan and receivables of the balance sheet date in estimating these loss we use statistical and analytical model that analyze portfolio performance and reflect our judgment regarding the quantitative component of the reserve the model take into account several factor including delinquency based loss migration rate loss emergence period and average loss and recovery over an appropriate historical period we also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserve for certain external and internal qualitative factor that may increase or decrease the reserve for loss on card member loan and receivables refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the process of estimating these reserve requires high degree of judgment to the extent historical credit experience updated for any external and internal qualitative factor such environmental trend is not indicative of future performance actual loss could differ significantly from our judgment and expectation resulting in either higher or lower future provision for card member loss in any quarter of december percent increase in our estimate of loss inherent in the outstanding portfolio of card member loan and receivables evaluated collectively for impairment would increase reserve for loss with corresponding change to provision for loss by approximately million this sensitivity analysis is provided hypothetical scenario to ass the sensitivity of the provision for loss it doe not represent our expectation for loss in the future nor doe it include how other portfolio factor such delinquency based loss migration rate or recovery or the amount of outstanding balance may impact the level of reserve for loss and the corresponding impact on the provision for loss liability for membership reward the membership reward program is our largest card based reward program card member can earn point for purchase charged on their enrolled card product significant portion of our card by their term allow card member to earn bonus point for purchase at merchant in particular industry category membership reward point are redeemable for broad variety of reward including travel shopping gift card and covering eligible charge point typically do not expire and there is no limit on the number of point card member may earn membership reward expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled card customer participation in the program and contractual arrangement with redemption partner we record membership reward liability that represents the estimated cost of point earned that are expected to be redeemed by card member in the future the membership reward liability is impacted over time by enrollment level attrition the volume of point earned and redeemed and the associated redemption cost we estimate the membership reward liability by determining the urr and the wac per point which are applied to the point of current enrollee refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information the urr assumption is used to estimate the number of point earned by current enrollee that will ultimately be redeemed in future period we use statistical and actuarial model to estimate the urr of point earned to date by current card member based on redemption trend card product type enrollment tenure card spend level and credit attribute the wac per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption cost and is primarily based on redemption choice made by card member reward offering by partner and membership reward program change the wac per point is derived from the previous month of redemption and is adjusted appropriate for certain change in redemption cost that are not representative of future cost expectation we periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumption based on development in redemption pattern cost per point redeemed partner contract change and other factor the process of estimating the membership reward liability includes high degree of judgment actual redemption and associated redemption cost could differ significantly from our estimate resulting in either higher or lower membership reward expense change in the membership reward urr and wac per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period membership reward expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all point previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollee of the end of the reporting period of december an increase in the estimated urr of current enrollee of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million similarly an increase in the wac per point of basis point would increase the membership reward liability and corresponding reward expense by approximately million table of content goodwill recoverability goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or when event or circumstance arise such adverse change in the business climate that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below it carrying value our methodology for conducting this goodwill impairment testing contains both qualitative and quantitative assessment we have the option to initially perform an assessment of qualitative factor in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount the qualitative factor may include but are not limited to economic condition industry and market consideration cost factor overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit specific event if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using more detailed quantitative assessment we could also directly perform this quantitative assessment for any reporting unit bypassing the qualitative assessment our methodology for conducting the quantitative goodwill impairment testing is fundamentally based on the measurement of fair value for our reporting unit which inherently entail the use of significant management judgment for valuation we use combination of the income approach discounted cash flow and market approach market multiple in estimating the fair value of our reporting unit when preparing discounted cash flow model under the income approach we estimate future cash flow using the reporting unit internal multi year forecast and terminal value calculated using growth rate that we believe is appropriate in light of current and expected future economic condition to discount these cash flow we use our expected cost of equity determined using capital asset pricing model when using the market method under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded company multiple earnings revenue to our reporting unit actual result the judgment in estimating forecasted cash flow discount rate and market comparables is significant and imprecision could materially affect the fair value of our reporting unit we could be exposed to an increased risk of further goodwill impairment if future operating result or macroeconomic condition differ significantly from management current assumption income tax we are subject to the income tax law of the united state it state and municipality and those of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate these tax law are complex and the manner in which they apply to the taxpayer fact is sometimes open to interpretation in establishing provision for income tax expense we must make judgment about the application of inherently complex tax law in particular the tax act is complex and requires interpretation of certain provision to estimate the impact on our income tax expense the estimate are based on the information available and our current interpretation of the tax act and may change due to change in interpretation and assumption we make and additional guidance or context from the internal revenue service the treasury department the financial accounting standard board or others regarding the tax act refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information unrecognized tax benefit we establish liability for unrecognized tax benefit which are the difference between tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return and the benefit recognized in the financial statement in establishing liability for an unrecognized tax benefit assumption may be made in determining whether and the extent to which tax position should be sustained tax position is recognized only when it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority based on it technical merit the amount of tax benefit recognized is the largest benefit that we believe is more likely than not to be realized on ultimate settlement new information becomes available we evaluate our tax position and adjust our unrecognized tax benefit appropriate tax benefit ultimately realized can differ from amount previously recognized due to uncertainty with any such difference generally impacting the provision for income tax deferred tax asset realization deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using the enacted tax rate expected to be in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse since deferred tax measure the future tax effect of item recognized in the consolidated financial statement certain estimate and assumption are required to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefit of deferred tax asset will not be realized in making this assessment we analyze and estimate the impact of future taxable income reversing temporary difference and available tax planning strategy these assessment are performed quarterly taking into account any new information change in fact or circumstance can lead to change in the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset due to uncertainty table of content other matter recently issued accounting standard refer to the recently issued accounting standard section

acquisition cost of an acquired business over the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed we allocate goodwill to our reporting unit for the purpose of impairment testing reporting unit is defined an operating segment or business that is one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is regularly reviewed by the operating segment manager we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually of june or more frequently if event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of one or more of our reporting unit below it carrying value prior to completing the assessment of goodwill for impairment we also perform recoverability test of certain long lived asset we have the option to perform qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value alternatively we can perform more detailed quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment this qualitative assessment entail the evaluation of factor such economic condition industry and market consideration cost factor overall financial performance of the reporting unit and other company and reporting unit specific event if we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we then perform the impairment evaluation using the quantitative assessment under the quantitative assessment the first step identifies whether there is potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting unit to the carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds the fair value then test is performed to determine the implied fair value of goodwill an impairment loss is recognized based on the amount that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value when measuring the fair value of our reporting unit in the quantitative assessment we use widely accepted valuation technique applying combination of the income approach discounted cash flow and market approach market multiple when preparing discounted cash flow model under the income approach we use internal forecast to estimate future cash flow expected to be generated by the reporting unit to discount these cash flow we use the expected cost of equity determined by using capital asset pricing model we believe the discount rate used appropriately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial market generally and specifically in our internally developed forecast when using market multiple under the market approach we apply comparable publicly traded company multiple earnings or revenue to our reporting unit actual result for the year ended december and we performed qualitative assessment in connection with our annual goodwill impairment evaluation and determined that it wa more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded their carrying value premise and equipment premise and equipment including leasehold improvement are carried at cost le accumulated depreciation cost incurred during construction are capitalized and are depreciated once an asset

improvement and from to year for premise which are depreciated based upon their estimated useful life at the acquisition date leasehold improvement are depreciated using the straight line method over the lesser of the remaining term of the leased facility or the economic life of the improvement and range from to year we maintain operating lease worldwide for facility and equipment rent expense for

various item certain reclassification of prior period amount have been made to conform to the current period presentation including the reclassification of certain business development expense from other expense to marketing and business development that were not directly attributable to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance recently issued and adopted accounting standard recently issued accounting standard in february the financial accounting standard board fasb issued new accounting guidance on lease the accounting standard effective january requires virtually all lease to be recognized on the consolidated balance sheet beginning with the quarter ending march our financial statement will reflect the adoption of this standard using the modified retrospective method we have elected the package of practical expedient and transition provision allowing to bring our existing operating lease onto the consolidated balance sheet without adjusting comparative period we have operating lease worldwide for facility and equipment which will be recorded lease related asset and liability upon adoption of the new guidance for those lease with term greater than month under the guidance we have also elected to not separate lease and non lease component in the recognition of the asset and liability well the related lease expense lease related asset or right of use asset will be recognized at the lease commencement date at amount equal to the respective lease liability adjusted for prepaid lease payment and initial direct cost and offset by lease incentive received lease related liability will be recognized at the present value of the remaining contractual fixed lease payment discounted using the company incremental borrowing rate operating lease expense will continue to be recognized on straight line basis over the lease term while variable lease payment will continue to be expensed incurred the adoption of the standard will have the impact of increasing consolidated asset and liability by approximately million and will not have material impact on our financial position result of operation cash flow or regulatory risk based capital in conjunction with the adoption we are upgrading our lease administration software and modifying our business process and internal control in june the fasb issued new accounting guidance for the recognition of credit loss on financial instrument effective january with early adoption permitted on january we do not intend to early adopt the new standard the guidance introduces new credit reserving model known the current expected credit loss cecl model which is based on expected loss and differs significantly from the incurred loss approach used today the cecl model requires measurement of expected credit loss not only based on historical experience and current condition but also by including reasonable and supportable forecast incorporating forward looking information in addition for available for sale debt security the new guidance replaces the other than temporary impairment model and requires the recognition of an allowance for reduction in security fair value attributable to decline in credit quality instead of direct write down of the security when valuation decline is determined to be other than temporary the guidance also requires cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the beginning of the reporting period of adoption we continue to evaluate the impact the new guidance will have on our financial position result of operation cash flow credit rating and regulatory risk based capital we expect that the cecl model will alter the assumption used in estimating credit loss on card member loan and receivables and may result in material increase to our credit reserve the new guidance involves earlier recognition of expected loss for the life of the asset however the extent of the impact will depend on the characteristic of our loan portfolio macroeconomic condition and forecasted information at the date of adoption we continue to be actively engaged in cross functional implementation effort and are in the process of developing and implementing cecl model that satisfy the requirement of the new standard along with appropriate business process and control in february result of the enactment of the tax cut and job act the tax act the fasb issued new accounting guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effect from aoci to retained earnings the optional reclassification is effective january we are evaluating the new guidance along with any impact on our financial position result of operation and cash flow none of which are expected to be material table of content recently adopted accounting standard effective january we adopted new revenue recognition guidance issued by the fasb related to contract with customer the scope of the new guidance excludes financial instrument such credit and charge card arrangement we elected to adopt the standard using the full retrospective method which we believe is most useful to our investor under the full retrospective method we are applying the standard back to january shown below the most significant impact of adoption are change to the classification of certain revenue and expense including certain credit and charge card related cost previously netted against discount revenue

addition to the matter disclosed under legal proceeding we are being challenged in number of country regarding our application of value added tax vat to certain of our international transaction which are in various stage of audit or are being contested in legal action collectively vat matter while we believe we have complied with all applicable tax law rule and regulation in the relevant jurisdiction the tax authority may determine that we owe additional vat in certain jurisdiction where we are contesting the assessment we were required to pay the vat assessment prior to contesting our legal proceeding range from case brought by single plaintiff to class action with million of putative class member these legal proceeding involve various line of business and variety of claim including but not limited to common law tort contract application of tax law antitrust and consumer protection claim some of which present novel factual allegation and or unique legal theory while some matter pending against specify the damage claimed by the plaintiff or class many seek an unspecified amount of damage or are at very early stage of the legal process even when the amount of damage claimed against are stated the claimed amount may be exaggerated and or unsupported result some matter have not yet progressed sufficiently through discovery and or development of important factual information and legal issue to enable to estimate an amount of loss or range of possible loss while other matter have progressed sufficiently such that we are able to estimate an amount of loss or range of possible loss we have accrued for certain of our outstanding legal proceeding an accrual is recorded when it is both probable that loss ha occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated there may be instance in which an exposure to loss exceeds the accrual we evaluate on quarterly basis development in legal proceeding that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the accrual that ha been previously recorded or revision to the disclosed estimated range of possible loss applicable table of content for those disclosed material legal proceeding and vat matter where loss is reasonably possible in future period whether in excess of recorded accrual for legal or tax contingency or where there is no such accrual and for which we are able to estimate range of possible loss the current estimated range is zero to million in excess of any accrual related to those matter this range represents management estimate based on currently available information and doe not represent our maximum loss exposure actual result may vary significantly such legal proceeding evolve we may need to increase our range of possible loss or recorded accrual in addition it is possible that significantly increased merchant steering or other action impairing the card member experience result of an adverse resolution in one or any combination of the merchant case disclosed in part item legal proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business based on our current knowledge and taking into consideration our litigation related liability we believe we are not party to nor are any of our property the subject of any legal proceeding that would have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or liquidity however in light of the

lease or other similar arrangement is approximately million in each of and million in each of and million in and million in aggregate thereafter of december we had billion in commitment related to agreement with certain cobrand partner under which we make payment based primarily on the amount of card member spending and corresponding reward earned on such spending and under certain arrangement on the number of account acquired and retained table of content note derivative and hedging activity we use derivative financial instrument to manage exposure to various market risk these instrument derive their value from an underlying variable or multiple variable including interest rate foreign exchange rate and an equity index or price and are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet these instrument enable end user to increase reduce or alter exposure to various market risk and for that reason are an integral component of our market risk management we do not transact in derivative for trading purpose market risk is the risk to earnings or asset and liability value resulting from movement in market price our market risk exposure include interest rate risk due to change in the relationship between interest rate on our asset such loan receivables and investment security and interest rate on our liability such debt and deposit and foreign exchange risk related to earnings funding transaction and investment in currency other than the dollar we centrally monitor market risk using market risk limit and escalation trigger defined in our asset liability management policy our market exposure are in large part by product of the delivery of our product and service interest rate risk primarily arises through the funding of card member receivables and fixed rate loan with variable rate borrowing well through the risk to net interest margin from change in the relationship between benchmark rate such prime libor and the overnight indexed swap rate interest rate exposure within our charge card and fixed rate lending product is managed by varying the proportion of total funding provided by short term and variable rate debt and deposit compared to fixed rate debt and deposit in addition interest rate swap are used from time to time to economically convert fixed rate debt obligation to variable rate obligation or to convert variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate obligation we may change the mix between variable rate and fixed rate funding based on change in business volume and mix among other factor foreign exchange risk is generated by card member cross currency spend foreign currency balance sheet exposure foreign subsidiary equity and foreign currency earnings in entity outside the united state our foreign exchange risk is managed primarily by entering into agreement to buy and sell currency on spot basis or by hedging this market exposure to the extent it is economical through various mean including the use of derivative such foreign exchange forward and cross currency swap contract derivative may give rise to counterparty credit risk which is the risk that derivative counterparty will default on or otherwise be unable to perform pursuant to an uncollateralized derivative exposure we manage this risk by considering the current exposure which is the replacement cost of contract on the measurement date well estimating the maximum potential value of the contract over the next month considering such factor the volatility of the underlying or reference index to mitigate derivative credit risk counterparties are required to be pre approved by and rated investment grade and counterparty risk exposure are centrally monitored additionally in order to mitigate the bilateral counterparty credit risk associated with derivative we have in certain instance entered into master netting agreement with our derivative counterparties which provide right of offset for certain exposure between the party majority of our derivative asset and liability of december and are subject to such master netting agreement with our derivative counterparties and there are no instance in which management make an accounting policy election to not net asset and liability subject to an enforceable master netting agreement on our consolidated balance sheet to further mitigate counterparty credit risk we exercise our right under executed credit support agreement with the respective derivative counterparties for most of our bilateral interest rate swap and select foreign exchange contract these agreement require that in the event the fair value change in the net derivative position between the two party exceeds certain dollar threshold the party in the net liability position post collateral to it counterparty all derivative contract cleared through central clearinghouse are collateralized to the full amount of the fair value of the contract in relation to our credit risk certain of our bilateral derivative agreement include provision that allow our counterparties to terminate the agreement in the event of downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade and settle the outstanding net liability position of december these derivative were not in net liability position we have no individually significant derivative counterparties and therefore no significant risk exposure to any single derivative counterparty based on our assessment of the credit risk of our derivative counterparties of december and no credit risk adjustment to the derivative portfolio wa required our derivative are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet the accounting for change in fair value depends on the instrument intended use and the resulting hedge designation if any discussed below refer to note for description of our methodology for determining the fair value of derivative table of content the following table summarizes the total fair value excluding interest accrual of derivative asset and liability of december other asset fair value other liability fair value million derivative designated hedging instrument fair value hedge interest rate

legally characterized settlement payment opposed to collateral includes foreign currency derivative embedded in certain operating agreement represents the offsetting of the fair value of bilateral interest rate contract and certain foreign exchange contract with the right to cash collateral held from the counterparty or cash collateral posted with the counterparty we posted million and million of december and respectively initial margin on our centrally cleared interest rate swap such amount are recorded within other receivables on the consolidated balance sheet and are not netted against the derivative balance represents the amount of netting of derivative asset and derivative liability executed with the same counterparty under an enforceable master netting arrangement derivative financial instrument that qualify for hedge accounting derivative executed for hedge accounting purpose are documented and designated such when we enter into the contract in accordance with our risk management policy we structure our hedge with term similar to those of the item being hedged we formally ass at inception of the hedge accounting relationship and on quarterly basis whether derivative designated hedge are highly effective in offsetting the fair value or cash flow of the hedged item these assessment usually are made through the application of regression analysis method if it is determined that derivative is not highly effective hedge we will discontinue the application of hedge accounting fair value hedge fair value hedge involves derivative designated to hedge our exposure to future change in the fair value of an asset or liability or an identified portion thereof that is attributable to particular risk interest rate contract we are exposed to interest rate risk associated with our fixed rate long term debt obligation at the time of issuance certain fixed rate debt obligation are designated in fair value hedging relationship using interest rate swap to economically convert the fixed interest rate to floating interest rate we have billion and billion of fixed rate debt obligation designated in fair value hedging relationship of december and respectively gain or loss on the fair value hedging instrument principally offset the loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the hedged item may not fully offset due to difference between debt obligation interest rate and the benchmark rate primarily due to credit spread at inception of the hedging relationship that are not reflected in the fair value of the interest rate swap furthermore the difference may be caused by change in month libor month libor and the overnight indexed swap rate spread between these rate impact the fair value of the interest rate swap without an exact offsetting impact to the fair value of the hedged debt the following table present the gain and loss associated with the fair value hedge of our fixed rate long term debt for the year ended december gain loss million interest expense other expense other expense fixed rate long term debt derivative designated hedging instrument total we adopted new accounting guidance providing targeted improvement to the accounting for hedging activity effective january in compliance with the standard amount previously recorded in other expense have been prospectively recorded in total interest expense refer to note for additional information table of content the carrying value of the hedged liability recorded within long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet were billion and billion of december and respectively including offsetting amount of million and million for the respective period related to the cumulative

ended december and respectively primarily related to the net settlement interest accrual on our interest rate derivative designated fair value hedge net investment hedge net investment hedge is used to hedge future change in currency exposure of net investment in foreign operation we primarily designate foreign currency derivative typically foreign exchange forward and on occasion foreign currency denominated debt hedge of net investment in certain foreign operation these instrument reduce exposure to change in currency exchange rate on our investment in non subsidiary we had notionals of approximately billion and billion of foreign currency derivative designated net investment hedge of december and respectively the gain or loss on net investment hedge net of tax recorded in aoci part of the cumulative translation adjustment wa gain of million loss of million and gain of million for the year ended december and respectively accumulated gain within aoci of million for the year ended december and loss of million and million for the year ended december and respectively were reclassified into other expense upon investment sale or liquidation derivative not designated hedge we have derivative that act economic hedge but are not designated such for hedge accounting purpose foreign currency transaction from time to time may be partially or fully economically hedged through foreign currency contract primarily foreign exchange forward these hedge generally mature within one year foreign currency contract involve the purchase and sale of designated currency at an agreed upon rate for settlement on specified date we also have certain operating agreement containing payment that may be linked to market rate or price primarily foreign currency rate the payment component of these agreement may meet the definition of an embedded derivative in which case the embedded derivative is accounted for separately and is classified foreign exchange contract based on it primary risk exposure the change in the fair value of derivative that are not designated hedge are intended to offset the related foreign exchange gain or loss of the underlying foreign currency exposure the change in the fair value of the derivative and the related underlying foreign currency exposure resulted in net gain of million net loss of million and net gain of million for the year ended december and respectively and are recognized in other expense the change in the fair value of an embedded derivative resulted in loss of million and nil for the year ended december and respectively and gain of million for the year ended december and are recognized in card member service expense table of content note fair value fair value is defined the price that would be required to sell an asset or paid

in active market are used to estimate fair value such investment security are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy when quoted price of identical investment security in active market are not available the fair value for our investment security are obtained primarily from pricing service engaged by and we receive one price for each security the fair value provided by the pricing service are estimated using pricing model where the input to those model are based on observable market input or recent trade of similar security such investment security are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy the input to the valuation technique applied by the pricing service vary depending on the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yield benchmark security price credit spread prepayment speed reported trade and broker dealer quote all with reasonable level of transparency the pricing service did not apply any adjustment to the pricing model used in addition we did not apply any adjustment to price received from the pricing service we reaffirm our understanding of the valuation technique used by our pricing service at least annually in addition we corroborate the price provided by our pricing service by comparing them to alternative pricing source in instance where price discrepancy are identified between different pricing source we evaluate such discrepancy to ensure that the price used for our valuation represent the fair value of the underlying investment security refer to note for additional fair value information derivative financial

rate note that have been swapped to floating rate through the use of interest rate swap the fair value of our long term debt is measured using quoted offer price when quoted market price are available if quoted market price are not available the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flow of each instrument at rate currently observed in publicly traded debt market for debt of similar term and credit risk for long term debt where there are no rate currently observable in publicly traded debt market of similar term and comparable credit risk we use market interest rate and adjust those rate for necessary risk including our own credit risk in determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing we consider credit default swap spread bond yield of other long
