lived asset section of our critical accounting estimate for discussion of our accounting for aircraft retirement decision outlook we anticipate revenue and earnings growth in driven by the continued strong performance of our fedex ground and fedex freight business and improving performance at fedex express our expected result for will be constrained by moderate growth in the global economy and continued challenge from the demand shift trend from our priority international service to our economy international service in response to these trend we will be evaluating additional capacity reduction and other action in during we will incur incremental cost to transform our information technology operation at fedex service in connection with our profit improvement program which will increase the cost allocated to our transportation segment in may in conjunction with the retirement of aircraft fedex express shortened the depreciable life of aircraft and related engine result of this decision and the decision to shorten the depreciable life of aircraft we expect to incur additional year over year accelerated depreciation expense of million in however lower pension expense in will positively impact our operating result in addition to continued profit improvement in the base business at fedex ground and fedex freight our profit improvement program announced in are targeting annual profitability improvement of billion at fedex express by the end of from the full year base business collectively these initiative are expected to increase margin improve cash flow and increase our competitiveness however the amount of benefit ultimately realized will vary depending upon future customer demand particularly for priority international service we expect to begin realizing portion of the benefit of these program in however the majority of the benefit including those from our voluntary severance program will not occur until and table of content our capital expenditure for are expected to increase to approximately billion for additional aircraft delivery in to support our fleet modernization program and continued expansion of the fedex ground network we will continue to evaluate our investment in critical long term strategic project to ensure our capital expenditure generate high return on investment and are balanced with our outlook for global economic condition for additional detail on key capital project refer to the capital resource and liquidity outlook section of this md our outlook is dependent upon stable pricing environment for fuel volatility in fuel price impact our fuel surcharge level fuel expense and demand for our service historically our fuel surcharge have largely offset incremental fuel cost however volatility in fuel cost may impact earnings because adjustment to our fuel surcharge lag change in actual fuel price paid therefore the trailing impact of adjustment to our fuel surcharge can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement and the independent contractor model section of our fedex ground segment md we are involved in number of lawsuit and other proceeding that challenge the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor fedex ground anticipates continuing change to it relationship with it owner operator the nature timing and amount of any change are dependent on the outcome of numerous future event we can not reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such change or meaningful range of potential outcome although they could be material however we do not believe that any such change will impair our ability to operate and profitably grow our fedex ground business see risk factor for discussion of these and other potential risk and uncertainty that could materially affect our future performance seasonality of business our business are cyclical in nature seasonal fluctuation affect volume revenue and earnings historically the express package business experience an increase in volume in late november and december international business particularly in the asia to market peak in october and november in advance of the holiday sale season our first and third fiscal quarter because they are summer vacation and post winter holiday season have historically experienced lower volume relative to other period normally the fall is the busiest shipping period for fedex ground while late december june and july are the slowest period for fedex freight the spring and fall are the busiest period and the latter part of december through february is the slowest period for fedex office the summer month are normally the slowest period shipment level operating cost and earnings for each of our company can also be adversely affected by inclement weather particularly the impact of severe winter weather in our third fiscal quarter recent accounting guidance new accounting rule and disclosure requirement can significantly impact our reported result and the comparability of our financial statement on june we adopted the authoritative guidance issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb on the presentation of comprehensive income the new guidance requires company to report component of comprehensive income by including comprehensive income on the face of the income statement or in separate statement of comprehensive income we have adopted this guidance by including separate statement of comprehensive income loss for the three year ending may and by including expanded accumulated other comprehensive income disclosure requirement in the note to our consolidated financial statement in addition on june we adopted the fasb amendment to the fair value measurement and disclosure requirement which expanded existing disclosure requirement regarding the fair value of our long term debt table of content in february the fasb issued new guidance requiring additional information about reclassification adjustment out of comprehensive income including change in comprehensive income balance by component and significant item reclassified out of comprehensive income this new standard is effective for our fiscal year ending may and will have no impact on our financial condition or result of operation in may the fasb issued revised exposure draft outlining proposed change to the accounting for lease under the revised exposure draft the recognition measurement and presentation of expense and cash flow arising from lease would depend primarily on whether the lessee is expected to consume more than an insignificant portion of the economic benefit embedded in the underlying asset right of use asset and liability to make lease payment will be recognized on the balance sheet for all lease except short term lease the enactment of this proposal will have significant impact on our accounting and financial reporting the fasb ha not yet proposed an effective date of this proposal we believe that no other new accounting guidance wa adopted or issued during that is relevant to the reader of our financial

expense increased due to the impact of recent business acquisition and the negative year over year comparison of the legal reserve accrual reversal in depreciation and amortization expense increased in result of aircraft recently placed into service and accelerated depreciation due to the shortened life of certain aircraft fedex express aircraft maintenance and repair cost are largely driven by aircraft utilization and required periodic maintenance event when newer aircraft are introduced into our operating fleet le maintenance cost are incurred part of our fleet modernization program fedex express ha retired older le efficient aircraft prior to required periodic maintenance event and ha introduced newly manufactured aircraft into the fleet result decrease in maintenance and repair cost wa experienced in and fuel cost decreased in due to lower jet fuel price and lower aircraft fuel usage based on static analysis of the net impact of year over year change in fuel price compared to year over year change in fuel surcharge fuel had slightly positive impact in this analysis considers the estimated impact of the reduction in fuel surcharge included in the base rate charged for fedex express service table of content fedex express segment operating income increased in primarily due to the benefit from the timing lag that exists between when fuel price change and when indexed fuel surcharge automatically adjust and domestic and international export package yield improvement result of the fedex express segment reflect the impact of two one time item in fedex express segment result for were negatively impacted by million result of the decision to retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine well six boeing aircraft and related engine to better align the domestic air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volume the operating result at the fedex express segment were favorably impacted by the reversal of legal reserve of million that wa initially recorded in fedex express segment result also benefited from milder winter compared to the negative impact of unusually severe winter weather in salary and employee benefit increased in due to higher incentive compensation accrual and the full reinstatement of company matching contribution effective january purchased transportation cost increased in due to cost associated with the expansion of our freight forwarding business at fedex trade network business acquisition in india and mexico and higher utilization of third party transportation provider primarily in europe intercompany charge increased in due to higher allocated variable incentive compensation expense fuel cost increased in due to increase in the average price per gallon of fuel fuel usage in wa down slightly fedex express segment outlook we expect revenue and earnings to increase at fedex express during due to slight growth in our international package and international domestic service in addition we expect operating income to improve through ongoing execution of our profit improvement program including improving yield adjusting network capacity and reducing structural cost however the demand shift from our priority international service to our economy international service will continue to constrain earnings growth in base yield on priority international service at fedex express continue to weaken based on our customer accelerating preference for our lower yielding service given the persistence of this trend we will continue evaluating further action to adjust our fedex express network capacity and shift lower yielding service into lower cost delivery network capital expenditure at fedex express are expected to increase in driven by an increase in aircraft investment we will continue to modernize our aircraft fleet at fedex express during by adding newer aircraft that are more reliable fuel efficient and technologically advanced and retiring older le efficient aircraft due to the accelerated retirement of certain aircraft and related engine to aid in modernizing our fleet and improving our global network we expect an additional million in year

in due to higher ltl yield and average daily ltl shipment ltl yield increased in due to improvement in fedex freight economy yield resulting from higher rate and lower weight per ltl shipment average daily ltl shipment increased in driven by our fedex freight economy service offering partially offset by transitional challenge encountered by some customer in the second half of while migrating fedex freight functionality to the fedex enterprise automated platform revenue per hundredweight is commonly used indicator of pricing trend but this metric can be influenced by many other factor such change in fuel surcharge weight per shipment length of haul and the mix of freight generally ltl freight is rated using standard class system for the ltl industry and class are assigned based on transportation characteristic including density risk and handling under the class system low value freight that is easy to handle unlikely to damage and dense will receive lower class rating and lower yield than expensive light bulky freight which is highly susceptible to damage and produce higher yield result change in revenue per hundredweight do not necessarily indicate actual change in underlying base rate during fedex freight revenue increased due to increased ltl yield and weight per ltl shipment partially offset by lower average daily ltl shipment ltl yield increased during due

united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account under the portable pension account the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual credit based on pay age and year of credited service and interest on the notional account balance the portable pension account benefit is payable lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee the plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on treasury index and corporate bond rate prior to certain employee earned benefit using traditional pension formula based on average earnings and year of service benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee table of content the current rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce tremendous volatility in our result financial condition and liquidity our pension expense is primarily function of the value of our plan asset and the discount rate used to measure our pension liability at single point in time at the end of our fiscal year the measurement date both of these factor are significantly influenced by the stock and bond market which in recent year have experienced substantial volatility in addition to expense volatility we are required to record year end adjustment to our balance sheet on an annual basis for the net funded status of our pension and postretirement healthcare plan these adjustment have fluctuated significantly over the past several year and like our pension expense are result of the discount rate and value of our plan asset at the measurement date the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity current funding law require increasingly aggressive funding level for our pension plan however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose so our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status temporary funding relief wa passed in july that will improve our funded status for those purpose over the next several year our retirement plan cost is included in the salary and employee benefit caption in our consolidated income statement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million domestic and international pension plan domestic and international defined contribution plan domestic and international postretirement healthcare plan total retirement plan cost increased million in driven by lower discount rate used to measure our benefit obligation at our may measurement date total retirement plan cost increased million in primarily due to higher expense for our plan due to the full restoration of company matching contribution on january amount recognized in our balance sheet reflect snapshot of the state of our long term pension liability at the plan measurement date and the effect of year end accounting on plan asset cumulative unrecognized actuarial loss were billion through may compared to billion through may these unrecognized loss reflect change in the discount rate and difference between expected and actual asset return which are being amortized over future period these unrecognized loss may be recovered in future period through actuarial gain however unless they are below corridor amount these unrecognized actuarial loss are required to be amortized and recognized in future period our pension expense includes amortization of these actuarial loss of million in million in and million in pension cost the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption including the discount rate and expected long term investment return on plan asset these assumption most significantly impact our pension plan table of content following is discussion of the key estimate we consider in determining our pension cost discount rate this is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year pension expense the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date decrease in the discount rate increase pension expense the discount rate affect the pbo and pension expense based on the measurement date described below measurement date discount rate amount determined by measurement date and discount rate pbo and expense pbo and expense pbo and expense pbo and expense we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the discount rate assumption is highly sensitive the following table illustrates for our largest pension plan sensitivity in million effect on effect on one basis point change in discount rate at our may measurement date basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion from to the discount rate used to value our liability ha declined by over basis point which increased the valuation of our liability by over billion plan asset the estimated average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption that also materially affect our pension cost it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradeable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund we have assumed an expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset for and the actual return during each of the last three fiscal year have exceeded that long term assumption the actual historical return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of investment manager fee for the year period ended may and net of investment manager fee for the year period ended may for we plan to lower our expected return on plan asset assumption for long term return on plan asset to we continue to refine our asset table of content and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the long duration of our plan liability and the relatively low annual draw on plan asset on that investment strategy one basis point change in our expected return on plan asset impact our pension expense by million pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan asset at the measurement date we use calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset which help mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increase and decrease by amortizing certain actuarial gain or loss over period no longer than four year another method used in practice applies the market value of plan asset at the measurement date for purpose of valuing plan asset for determining pension expense the calculated value method resulted in the same value the market value funded status following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year our retirement plan cost are expected to decrease approximately million in due to significant increase in the value of our plan asset in and an increase in our discount rate at our may measurement date funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under irs rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan remain adequately funded to provide benefit to our employee they come due additionally current benefit payment are nominal compared to our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset during we made million in required contribution to our pension plan over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution amount contributed in excess of the minimum required can result in credit balance for funding purpose that can be used to reduce minimum contribution requirement in future year our current credit balance exceeds billion at may for we anticipate making required contribution to our pension plan totaling approximately million see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and long term disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim table of content self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated undiscounted cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency of claim and future healthcare cost cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by operating company and type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense historically it ha been infrequent that incurred claim exceeded our self insured limit we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset property and equipment our key business are capital intensive with approximately of our total asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure we capitalize only those cost that meet the definition of capital asset under accounting standard accordingly repair and maintenance cost that do not extend the useful life of an asset or are not part of the cost of acquiring the asset are expensed incurred the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control in may fedex express made the decision to accelerate the retirement of aircraft and related engine to aid in our fleet modernization and improve our global network in may we shortened the depreciable life for aircraft and related engine to accelerate the retirement of these aircraft resulting in depreciation expense increase of million in result of these accelerated retirement we expect an additional million in year over year accelerated depreciation expense in because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand and that an impairment of our asset may occur aircraft purchase primarily aircraft in passenger configuration that have not been placed in service totaled million at may and million at may we plan to modify these asset in the future and place them into operation table of content the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis factor which could cause impairment include but are not limited to adverse change in our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including lower capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation or change to planned service expansion activity we currently have one aircraft temporarily idled this aircraft ha been idled for month and is expected to return to revenue service in may we made the decision to retire from service two airbus aircraft and four related engine three airbus aircraft and two related engine and five boeing aircraft and related engine to align with the plan of fedex express to modernize it aircraft fleet and improve it global network consequence of this decision noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share wa recorded in the fourth quarter all of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service in we incurred noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share this charge related to our may decision to permanently retire aircraft and related engine to better align the domestic air network capacity of fedex express to match current and anticipated shipment volume the majority of these aircraft were temporarily idled and not in revenue service lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor disclosed in contractual cash obligation and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement at may we had approximately billion on an undiscounted basis of future commitment for payment under operating lease the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately six year the future commitment for operating lease are not reflected liability in our balance sheet under current accounting rule the determination of whether lease is accounted for capital lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period make the lessee an agent for the owner lessor or in substance the owner of the asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation under proposed revision to the accounting standard for lease we would be required to record an asset and liability for our outstanding operating lease similar to the current accounting for capital lease notably the amount we record in the future would be the net present value of our future lease commitment at the date of adoption this proposed guidance ha not been issued and ha been subjected to numerous revision since the proposal wa issued most recently in may while we are not required to quantify the effect of the proposed rule change until these rule are finalized we believe that majority of the operating lease table of content obligation reflected in the contractual cash obligation table would be required to be reflected in our balance sheet were the proposed rule to be adopted furthermore our existing financing agreement and the rating agency that evaluate our creditworthiness already take our operating lease into account goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset we have acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired entity in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment which requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to two step process to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate we perform our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter unless circumstance indicate the need to accelerate the timing of the test our reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include our fedex express fedex freight and fedex office reported in the fedex service segment reporting unit we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit exceeded their carrying value in and and we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were at risk of may contingency we are subject to various loss contingency including tax proceeding and litigation in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any our material pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter tax contingency we are subject to income and operating tax rule of the it state and municipality and of the foreign jurisdiction in which we operate significant judgment is required in determining income tax provision well deferred tax asset and liability balance and related deferred tax valuation allowance if necessary due to the complexity of these rule and their interaction with one another we account for income tax by recording both current tax payable and deferred tax asset and liability our provision for income tax is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we operate applied to taxable income reduced by applicable tax credit tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate and are impacted by several factor including tax audit appeal litigation change in tax law and other rule and their interpretation and change in our business we regularly ass the potential impact of these factor for the current and prior year to determine the adequacy of our tax provision we continually evaluate the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust our tax position including the current and deferred tax liability in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence table of content we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current liability the remaining portion of our income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty are presented noncurrent liability because payment of cash is not anticipated within one year of the balance sheet date these noncurrent income tax liability are recorded in the caption other liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet we account for operating tax based on multi state local and foreign taxing jurisdiction rule in those area in which we operate provision for operating tax are estimated based upon these rule asset acquisition and disposal historical spend and other variable these provision are consistently evaluated for reasonableness against compliance and risk factor we measure and record operating tax contingency accrual in accordance with accounting guidance for contingency discussed below this guidance requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable that loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated other contingency because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to other legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter employment related claim and fedex ground owner operator accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of any existing matter table of content in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each lawsuit any opportunity to dispose of the lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before the trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor our financial and operating result are subject to many risk and uncertainty described below we are directly affected by the state of the economy while macro economic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macro economic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market in slower than expected economic growth resulted in continued customer preference for slower le costly shipping service which had negative impact on our profitability our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our employee contractor or agent such customer service mishap or noncompliance with anti corruption law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such youtube and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to defend against damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand table of content we rely heavily on information and technology to operate our transportation and business network and any disruption to our technology infrastructure or the internet could harm our operation and our reputation among customer our ability to attract and retain customer and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer external and internal risk such malware code anomaly act of god attempt to penetrate our network transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage and human error pose direct threat to our product service and data any disruption to the internet or our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and customer web site could adversely impact our customer service volume and revenue and result in increased cost these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party while we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management and disaster recovery plan these measure can not fully insulate from technology disruption or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on our operation and financial result our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft vehicle technology package handling facility sort equipment copy equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to asset disposition or write down and undercapacity could negatively impact service level for example in the fourth quarter of we made decision to retire from service certain aircraft and excess aircraft engine and thus recorded noncash impairment charge of million we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macro economic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource than we do or they are controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however an irrational pricing environment can limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our market share in addition high volume package shipper could develop in house ground delivery capability which would in turn reduce our revenue and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service or more effectively bundle their service or our current customer become competitor it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share table of content if we do not effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy in we made strategic acquisition in poland france and brazil while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and prevent labor organization from organizing group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot of fedex express all of our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the purview of the railway labor act of amended the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report on form under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended the nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor fedex ground relies on owner operator to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these owner operator independent contractor rather than employee is being challenged fedex ground use of independent contractor is well suited to the need of the ground delivery business and it customer evidenced by the strong growth of this business segment we are involved in numerous lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator or their driver should be treated our employee rather than independent contractor we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of fedex ground owner operator independent contractor we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator change to state law governing the definition of independent contractor could impact the status of fedex ground owner operator if fedex ground is compelled to convert it independent contractor to employee labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay failure to execute on our business realignment program will cause our future financial result to suffer in we announced profit improvement program primarily through initiative at fedex express and fedex service that include cost reduction modernization of our aircraft fleet transformation of the domestic operation and international profit improvement at fedex express and improved efficiency and lower cost of information technology at fedex service to this end during we conducted program to offer voluntary cash buyout to eligible based employee in certain staff function additionally we announced in may our decision to retire from service aircraft and related engine well to shorten the depreciable life of an additional aircraft and related engine in an effort to modernize our aircraft fleet and improve our global network we will continue to work towards the plan of annual profitability improvement of billion by the end of but if we are not able to reach this goal in the face of challenging economic condition our future financial result may suffer table of content the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration continues to require fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement these requirement are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the united state and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the united state such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and diesel engine emission for example during the european commission approved the extension of the european union emission trading scheme ets for ghg emission to the airline industry under this decision all fedex express flight to and from any airport in any member state of the european union are now covered by the ets requirement and each year we are required to submit emission allowance in an amount equal to the carbon dioxide emission from such flight because the european union ets is being contested by many country on number of front and the effective date for part of the ets ha been delayed until next year the future impact on is unclear in addition the congress ha in the past considered bill that would regulate ghg emission and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or diesel engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could impose material cost on moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macro economic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem localized disaster in key geography could adversely impact our business while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such tornado flood earthquake or terrorist attack the loss of key location such our memphis super hub or one of our information technology center could cause significant disruption to our operation and cause to incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service table of content our business may be adversely impacted by disruption or modification in service by the usps the usps is significant customer and vendor of fedex and thus disruption or modification in service by the usps consequence of the usps current financial difficulty or any resulting structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial result we are also subject to other risk and uncertainty that affect many other business including increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit the increasing cost of compliance with federal and state governmental agency mandate and defending against inappropriate or unjustified enforcement or other action by such agency the impact of any international conflict on the united state and global economy in general the transportation industry or in particular and what effect these event will have on our cost or the demand for our service any impact on our business resulting from new domestic or international government law and regulation change in foreign currency exchange rate especially in the chinese yuan euro brazilian real canadian dollar and the british pound which can affect our sale level and foreign currency sale price market acceptance of our new service and growth initiative any liability resulting from and the cost of defending against class action litigation such wage and hour and discrimination and retaliation claim and any other legal or governmental proceeding the outcome of future negotiation to reach new collective bargaining agreement including with the union that represents the pilot of fedex express the current pilot contract became amendable in march and the party are currently in negotiation the impact of technology development on our operation and on demand for our service and our ability to continue to identify and eliminate unnecessary information

provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plan includes numerous assumption such discount rate expected long term investment return on plan asset future salary increase employee turnover mortality and retirement age these assumption most significantly impact our pension plan the accounting guidance related to postretirement benefit requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan and the recognition in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci of unrecognized gain or loss and prior service cost or credit the funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the projected benefit obligation pbo of the plan we recorded an increase to equity of million net of tax at may and decrease to equity of billion net of tax at may attributable to our plan summary of our retirement plan cost over the past three year is follows in million domestic and international pension plan domestic and international defined contribution plan domestic and international postretirement healthcare plan total retirement plan cost in were higher than due to the negative impact of significantly lower discount rate at our may measurement date total retirement plan cost increased in primarily due to higher expense for our plan due to the full restoration of company matching contribution on january pension plan our largest pension plan cover certain employee age and over with at least one year of service pension benefit for most employee are accrued under cash balance formula we call the portable pension account under the portable pension account the retirement benefit is expressed dollar amount in notional account that grows with annual credit based on pay age and year of credited service and interest on the notional account balance the portable pension account benefit is payable lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee the plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on treasury index and corporate bond rate prior to certain employee earned benefit using traditional pension formula based on average earnings and year of service benefit under this formula were capped on may for most employee we also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plan covering certain of our employee group and other pension plan covering certain of our international employee the international defined benefit pension plan provide benefit primarily based on final earnings and year of service and are funded in compliance with local law and practice postretirement healthcare plan certain of our subsidiary offer medical dental and vision coverage to eligible retiree and their eligible dependent employee covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefit at age and older if they have permanent continuous service of at least year after attainment of age if hired prior to january or at least year after attainment of age if hired on or after january postretirement healthcare benefit are capped at of the per caput projected employer cost which ha been reached and therefore these benefit are not subject to additional future inflation pension plan assumption our pension cost is materially affected by the discount rate used to measure pension obligation the level of plan asset available to fund those obligation and the expected long term rate of return on plan asset table of content fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued we use measurement date of may for our pension and postretirement healthcare plan management review the assumption used to measure pension cost on an annual basis economic and market condition at the measurement date impact these assumption from year to year actuarial gain or loss are generated for change in assumption and to the extent that actual result differ from those assumed these actuarial gain and loss are amortized over the remaining average service life of our active employee if they exceed corridor amount in the aggregate additional information about our pension plan can be found in the critical accounting estimate section of management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition md in this annual report on form annual report weighted average actuarial assumption for our primary retirement plan which represent substantially all of our pbo and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo are follows pension plan postretirement healthcare plan discount rate used to determine benefit obligation discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine benefit obligation rate of increase in future compensation level used to determine net periodic benefit cost expected long term rate of return on asset the estimated average rate of return on plan asset is the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset and is forward looking assumption that materially affect our pension cost establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter we review the expected long term rate of return on an annual basis and revise it appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund our expected long term rate of return on plan asset wa for and our actual return in each of the past three year exceeded that amount for our principal domestic pension plan for the year period ended may our actual return were for we plan to lower our expected return on plan asset assumption for long term return on plan asset to we continue to refine our asset and liability management strategy in lowering this assumption we considered our historical return our investment strategy for our plan asset including the impact of the long duration of our plan liability and the relatively low annual draw on plan asset on that investment strategy pension expense is also affected by the accounting policy used to determine the value of plan asset at the measurement date we use calculated value method to determine the value of plan asset which help mitigate short term volatility in market performance both increase and decrease by amortizing certain actuarial gain or loss over period no longer than four year another method used in practice applies the market value of plan asset at the measurement date for purpose of valuing plan asset for determining pension expense the calculated value method resulted in the same value the market value it did in for determining pension expense we used the calculated value method which resulted in portion of the asset gain in being deferred to future year because our actual return on plan asset significantly exceeded our assumption table of content fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued the investment strategy for pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of global public and private equity portfolio together with fixed income portfolio to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradeable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager our largest holding class are large cap equity which is indexed to the index corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we have transitioned to liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage exposure to market risk in all case our investment manager are prohibited from using derivative for speculative purpose and are not permitted to use derivative to leverage portfolio following is description of the valuation methodology used for investment measured at fair value cash and cash equivalent these level investment include cash cash equivalent and foreign currency valued using exchange rate the level investment include commingled fund valued using the net asset value domestic and international equity these level investment are valued at the closing price or last trade reported on the major market on which the individual security are traded the level investment are commingled fund valued using the net asset value private equity the valuation of these level investment requires significant judgment due to the absence of quoted market price the inherent lack of liquidity and the long term nature of such asset investment are valued based upon recommendation of our investment manager incorporating factor

number of lawsuit containing various class action allegation of wage and hour violation the plaintiff in these lawsuit allege among other thing that they were forced to work off the clock were not paid overtime or were not provided work break or other benefit the complaint generally seek unspecified monetary damage injunctive relief or both we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible with respect to any of these matter independent contractor lawsuit and state administrative proceeding fedex ground is involved in numerous class action lawsuit including that have been certified class action individual lawsuit and state tax and other administrative proceeding that claim that the company owner operator should be treated employee rather than independent contractor most of the class action lawsuit were consolidated for administration of the pre trial proceeding by single federal court the district court for the northern district of indiana the multidistrict litigation court granted class certification in case and denied it in case on december the court entered an opinion and order addressing all outstanding motion for summary judgment on the status of the owner operator independent contractor employee in sum the court ha now ruled on our summary judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of fedex ground on all claim in of the multidistrict litigation case that had been certified class action finding that the owner operator in those case were contractor matter of the law of state the plaintiff filed notice of appeal in all of these case the seventh circuit heard the appeal in the kansa case in january and in july issued an opinion that did not make determination with respect to the correctness of the district court decision and instead certified two question to the kansa supreme court related to the classification of the plaintiff independent contractor under the kansa wage payment act the other case that are before the seventh circuit remain stayed pending decision of the kansa supreme court table of content fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement continued the multidistrict litigation court remanded the other eight certified class action back to the district court where they were originally filed because it summary judgment ruling did not completely dispose of all of the claim in those lawsuit three of those case are now on appeal with the court of appeal for the ninth circuit the other five remain pending in their respective district court while the granting of summary judgment in favor of fedex ground by the multidistrict litigation court in of the case that had been certified class action remains subject to appeal we believe that it significantly improves the likelihood that our independent contractor model will be upheld adverse determination in matter related to fedex ground independent contractor however could among other thing entitle certain of our owner operator and their driver to the reimbursement of certain expense and to the benefit of wage and hour law and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground and could result in change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator in certain jurisdiction we believe that fedex ground owner operator are properly classified independent contractor and that fedex ground is not an employer of the driver of the company independent contractor while it is reasonably possible that potential loss in some of these lawsuit or such change to the independent contractor status of fedex ground owner operator could be material we can not yet determine the amount or reasonable range of potential loss number of factor contribute to this the number of plaintiff in these lawsuit continues to change with some being dismissed and others being added and to new plaintiff discovery is still ongoing in addition the party have conducted only limited discovery into damage which could vary considerably from plaintiff to plaintiff further the range of potential loss could be impacted considerably by future ruling on the merit of certain claim and fedex ground various defense and on evidentiary issue in any event we do not believe that material loss is probable in these matter in addition we are defending contractor model case that are not or are no longer part of the multidistrict litigation three of which have been certified class action these case are in varying stage of litigation and we do not expect to incur material loss in any of these matter other matter in august third party consultant who work with shipping customer to negotiate lower rate filed lawsuit in federal district court in california against fedex and united parcel service inc ups alleging violation of antitrust law this matter wa dismissed in may but the court granted the plaintiff permission to file an amended complaint which fedex received in june in november the court

the policy and practice of fedex and ups for dealing with third party consultant who work with shipping customer to negotiate lower rate in november the doj served civil investigative demand on the third party consultant seeking all pleading deposition and document produced in the lawsuit we are cooperating with the investigation do not believe that we have engaged in any anti competitive activity and will vigorously defend in any action that may result from the investigation while the litigation proceeding and the doj investigation move forward and the amount of loss if any is dependent on number of factor that are not yet fully developed or resolved we do not believe that material loss is reasonably possible we have received request for information from the doj in the northern district of california in connection with criminal investigation relating to the transportation of package for online pharmacy that may have shipped pharmaceutical in violation of federal law we responded to grand jury subpoena issued in june and august and to additional request for information pursuant to those subpoena and we continue to respond and cooperate with the investigation we believe that our employee have acted in good faith at all time we do not believe that we have engaged in any illegal activity and will vigorously defend ourselves in any action that may result from
