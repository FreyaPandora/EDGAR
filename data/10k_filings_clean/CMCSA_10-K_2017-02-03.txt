changing and sometimes change existing statute rule or regulation or interpretation of existing statute rule or regulation or comcast annual report on form table of content prescribe new one any of which may significantly affect our business in addition in recent year the fcc and certain state have been more active in considering rulemakings and legislation well in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant congress may consider proposal to address communication issue including whether it rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace whether it should address the fcc authority to implement or enforce open internet regulation and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effect of any of these or any other further legislative requirement on our business in addition with the new administration in place the fcc and other agency may pursue new regulation or seek change to or the elimination of existing regulation such the classification of broadband internet service and requirement relating to the internet and privacy we can not predict what change will be sought and if adopted they will affect our business the following paragraph summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirement affecting our business although reference should be made to the communication act fcc regulation the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulation for further information cable communication segment video service program carriage cable operator and other multichannel video provider are prohibited from requiring condition of carriage financial interest in or exclusive distribution right for video programming network in addition fcc regulation well the nbcuniversal order prohibit from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating the network on the basis of it non affiliation in the selection term or condition for it carriage we have been involved in program carriage dispute at the fcc and may be subject to new complaint in the future must carry retransmission consent cable operator are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television station an alternative to this must carry requirement local broadcast television station may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station give up it must carry right and instead seek to negotiate carriage agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payment to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the station broadcast programming to our video service customer and expect to continue to be subject to demand for increased payment and other concession from local broadcast television station for information on must carry and retransmission consent issue relating to our broadcast television business see nbcuniversal segment broadcast television below and refer to the must carry retransmission consent discussion within that section pricing and packaging in the fcc revised it rate regulation to create presumption that all local community are subject to effective competition and should no longer be subject to rate regulation that limit price cable operator may charge for basic video service equipment and installation that decision ha been appealed in federal court while the fcc ha accepted certification from massachusetts franchising authority that demonstrated an absence of effective competition in number of the community we serve in massachusetts that will allow for comcast annual report on form table of content continued rate regulation in those community all of the other area we serve are unregulated in addition to the fcc rate regulation rule certain state entity monitor and may challenge the marketing and advertising of our service for example in the washington state attorney general filed suit in state court alleging our service protection plan an optional plan that protects customer from incurring charge for service visit to diagnose and repair installed in home wiring for residential cable service violates state consumer protection law cable equipment the communication act includes provision aimed at promoting the retail availability of set top box and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video service in the fcc launched rulemaking to consider proposed technology mandate on multichannel video provider aimed at enabling third party retail video device to access provider video service without the need for provider supplied set top box if implemented these mandate would impose substantial cost on impair our ability to innovate and have other adverse effect on our business it is unclear whether the fcc under the new administration will pursue this proceeding or adopt these rule pole attachment the fcc regulates the rate term and condition that most pole owning utility company charge cable operator and telecommunication carrier including broadband internet access service provider such for allowing attachment to their pole state are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rate term and condition of attachment and many state in which we operate have done most of these state have generally followed the fcc pole attachment rate standard which set rate for telecommunication service pole attachment to level at or near the rate for cable service attachment in the fcc eliminated the ability of utility company to justify higher rate for telecommunication service pole attachment cable operator had requested this fcc action the fcc new open internet regulation described below under the heading open internet regulation reclassified internet access service telecommunication service which could have allowed for higher rental rate to be applied to majority of our pole attachment the fcc order ensuring that pole rate for telecommunication service attachment approximate the cable service pole rate ha been appealed in federal court by the utility company some municipality have enacted one touch make ready pole attachment ordinance which permit third party to alter component of our network attached to utility pole in way that could adversely affect our business we and other provider have filed complaint in federal court challenging these ordinance franchising cable operator generally operate their cable system under nonexclusive franchise granted by local or state franchising authority while the term and condition of franchise vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchise typically last for fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fee and meet service quality customer service and other requirement and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision franchising authority also may establish reasonable requirement for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchise require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communication act also contains provision governing the franchising process including renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denial of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospect are generally favorable but can not guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise approximately half of the state in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirement for new entrant some allow new entrant to operate on more favorable term than our current operation for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all part of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portion it wish to serve certain state allow incumbent cable operator such to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later comcast annual report on form table of content competing state franchise ha been issued although even in those state incumbent cable operator may be required to retain certain franchise obligation that are more burdensome than the new entrant state franchise high speed internet service we provide high speed internet service to our customer many of these service are subject to number of regulatory obligation described below including open internet regulation prescribed by the fcc and certain common carrier regulation under title ii of the communication act an internet service provider isp we are also subject to requirement to implement certain network capability to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of person suspected of criminal activity from time to time the fcc considers imposing new regulatory obligation on isps including for example proposal to require broadband network outage reporting new broadband regulation if adopted may have adverse effect on our business open internet regulation in the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service telecommunication service subject to new open internet regulation and certain common carrier regulation under title ii of the communication act including requirement that charge and practice of isps for and in connection with broadband internet access service be reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory however the fcc refrained from implementing number of utility style regulation that might otherwise apply under title ii such rate regulation tariff and unbundling requirement the new open internet regulation bar isps from blocking access to lawful content application service or non harmful device prohibit isps from impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content application or service or impairing or degrading the use of non harmful device prohibit isps from favoring lawful traffic from one provider of internet content application or service called an edge provider over lawful traffic of another edge provider in exchange for consideration paid prioritization establish new general conduct standard that prohibits isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumer to select access and use the lawful internet content application service or device of their choosing or of edge provider to make lawful content application service or device available to consumer and require isps to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial term of the service in addition interconnection arrangement which govern how internet traffic is exchanged between high speed internet network and provide direct dedicated interconnection capacity to edge provider are now subject to fcc oversight under title ii of the communication act all of these regulation are subject to fcc enforcement and could give rise to third party claim for damage or equitable relief these requirement could adversely affect our business although the extent to which they do so will depend upon the manner in which the fcc interprets and enforces them in june panel of the united state court of appeal for the district of columbia affirmed the fcc new open internet regulation on appeal petition have been filed requesting rehearing of the decision in addition congress may consider legislation addressing these regulation and the fcc under the new administration may also revisit the rule we can not predict whether or how the rule might be changed state have attempted and may continue to attempt to use the fcc open internet decision to justify imposing new regulation and tax and fee on isps that could adversely affect our business separate and apart from the fcc new open internet regulation we committed to be bound by the fcc original open internet regulation adopted in condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree although we not agree to be bound by any future open internet regulation result among other thing we can not block access to lawful internet content application service or non harmful device or unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful internet network traffic although we may engage in reasonable network management comcast annual report on form table of content business data service in april the fcc proposed new regulation for business data service formerly special access service which provide dedicated point to point transmission of data at certain guaranteed speed and service level using high capacity connection the fcc proposed new rate regulation and other regulatory mandate that could apply to business data service offered by cable company the proposed rule or any variation of the proposed rule if implemented could impose substantial cost on and have other significant adverse effect on our business it is uncertain whether the fcc under the new administration will pursue this proceeding or adopt these rule nbcuniversal order consent decree condition the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various condition and commitment requiring to offer all of our broadband internet access service speed tier on stand alone basis at reasonable market based price to maintain broadband internet access service of at least mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to avoid discrimination in how we treat specialized service defined service we provide over the same last mile facility our broadband internet access service but not including our broadband internet access service video service or voice service municipally owned broadband network number of local municipality operate municipally owned broadband network certain state have enacted law that restrict or prohibit local municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network the fcc effort to preempt such law in tennessee and north carolina were overturned in by the united state court of appeal for the sixth circuit however there may be further effort by local government to expand or create government owned network and there may also be effort in state legislature to restrict the development of government owned network or to ease or facilitate such network in addition part of any federal infrastructure program governmental subsidy or funding of additional internet broadband network may be encouraged we can not predict how successful those effort will be and how they might affect our business voice service we provide voice service using voip technology the fcc ha adopted number of regulation for provider of nontraditional voice service such ours including regulation relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duty and benefit disability access law enforcement assistance outage reporting universal service fund contribution obligation and certain regulatory filing requirement the fcc ha not yet ruled on whether voip service such ours should be classified an information service or telecommunication service under the communication act the classification determination is important because telecommunication service are regulated more extensively than information service state regulatory commission and legislature may continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirement on our voice service and the fcc open internet regulation reclassifying internet access telecommunication service may further encourage state level regulatory action voice interconnection because the fcc ha not determined the appropriate classification of our voice service provider of voip service typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone company network by contracting with an existing clec which ha the right telecommunication carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone company we have arranged for such interconnection right through affiliated clecs if regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice service and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted the fcc regulates the arrangement by which telecommunication carrier compensate one another for exchanged traffic and ha affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip provider comcast annual report on form table of content universal service the federal universal service program generally requires and other phone service provider to pay fee based on revenue from their service into fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunication service in high cost area and to low income consumer and the provision of internet and telecommunication service to school library and certain health care provider some state also have analogous program that support service in high cost area or to low income consumer the fcc ha long considered implementing change to the universal service program such changing the fee calculation from revenue based formula to per user fee or per connection fee adopting fee based on bandwidth and expanding the service subject to the fee to include broadband internet access service we are unable to predict if or how the fcc may change the universal service program or the effect any such change would have on our business the fcc recently ha shifted it focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing broadband deployment this shift could assist some of our competitor for example in the fcc substantially revised the program that provides universal service support for service to school and library to shift support from voice service to broadband service and the deployment of wi fi network similarly the fcc ha expanded it lifeline subsidy program for low income consumer to include broadband service in addition to voice service the fcc under the new administration or congress may revisit these subsidy program and how they are funded we can not predict whether or how these program will be changed nbcuniversal segment cable network program access the communication act and fcc regulation the program access rule generally prevent cable network affiliated with cable operator from favoring cable operator over competing multichannel video programming distributor mvpds the fcc and congress have considered proposal that would require company that own multiple cable network to make each of their network available individually when negotiating distribution agreement with mvpds and potentially with online video distributor ovds we currently offer our cable network both on bundled basis and when requested individually under the term of the nbcuniversal order mvpds in certain circumstance can invoke commercial arbitration for access to our cable network and broadcast television network including our

ownership limit fcc regulation limit the ability of individual and entity to have attributable interest specific ownership level in local television station and place limitation on ownership of other

television ownership the communication act and fcc regulation limit the number of broadcast television station one entity may own or control nationally no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television station that reach in the aggregate more than of all television household the fcc also ha adopted rule that eliminates discount formerly afforded to uhf station channel and above in calculating the extent of an individual station owner holding under the national cap our owned broadcast television station reach doe not exceed this limit but the elimination of this discount place closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire station in the future foreign ownership the communication act generally limit foreign ownership in broadcast television station to

product and service and entertainment news and information content to consumer technological change are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and influencing consumer behavior which is discussed in the risk factor immediately below under the heading change in consumer behavior driven by new technology and distribution platform for viewing content may adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model competition for our cable service consists primarily of db provider and phone company with fiber based network that typically offer feature pricing and packaging for service comparable to ours in at our largest phone company competitor acquired directv the nation largest db provider to create an even larger competitor that also ha it own wireless phone facility which we do not and in announced proposed merger with time warner medium and entertainment company some of these competitor have begun offering smaller package of channel at price point lower than our standard package both through traditional and online distribution platform which could cause to offer more customized programming package that may be le profitable in

communication segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future each of nbcuniversal business also face substantial and increasing competition from provider of similar type of content well from other form of entertainment and recreational activity nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resource required in operating these business the ability of all of our business to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituency including our customer consumer advertiser investor and government authority our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customer with satisfactory customer experience there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitor or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business for more detailed description of the competition facing our business see item business and refer to the competition discussion within that section change in consumer behavior driven by new technology and distribution platform for viewing content may adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model new technology and platform for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitor that all our business face and challenge existing business model these technology and distribution platform are driving change in consumer behavior consumer seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communication service while our cable communication business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behavior for example by deploying our platform cloud dvr technology and apps such netflix on our set top box new and traditional competitor well some programming network continue to launch subscription video on demand service live online broadcast and cable television streaming service and downloading service that can be viewed on television set computer smartphones and tablet many of these service offering charge no fee or lower fee than our traditional video package for access to their content which could have an adverse effect on demand for our video service including for expanded digital video package premium network and our dvr and on demand service new technology and distribution platform together with an increasing number of company offering their content directly to consumer over the internet including some that also offer exclusive high quality original comcast annual report on form table of content video programming have increased the number of entertainment choice available to consumer which ha intensified audience fragmentation the increase in entertainment choice ha and may continue to reduce the number of subscriber to our cable network time shifting technology such dvrs and cloud based recording service and video on demand service reduce the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlet reduced viewing of our content through traditional linear television distribution outlet ha caused and will likely continue to cause audience rating decline for nbcuniversal linear television content and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertiser are willing to purchase from and the amount nbcuniversal receives for distribution of it content the success of any of these ongoing or future development or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business our cable communication cable network and broadcast television business compete for the sale of advertising time with other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such digital medium well radio and print we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of viewer and audience fragmentation the growing use of new technology or the economy in general in addition advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating which many of our network have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sale and rate also are dependent on the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level for example certain method of viewing content such delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content online might not be counted in audience measurement or may generate le if any revenue than traditional distribution method which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue reduction in advertiser expenditure could adversely affect our revenue and business our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide them with competitive advantage for example current and new wireless internet technology such and wireless broadband service continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability and some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed we expect other advance in communication technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of docsis set top box wireless gateway and cloud dvr technology and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may incur increased cost if change in our competitor product offering require that we offer certain of our existing service or enhancement at lower or no cost to our customer or that we make additional research and development expenditure comcast annual report on form table of content we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authority which may impose additional cost and restriction on our business federal state and local government extensively regulate the video high speed internet and voice service industry our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal law and regulation our cable network filmed entertainment and theme park business are also subject to various other law and regulation at the international federal state and local level including law and regulation relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the

relating to the treatment of competitor and other matter in recent year the fcc and certain state also have been more active in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service and this trend may continue failure to comply with the law and regulation applicable to our business could result in administrative enforcement action fine and civil and criminal liability for more extensive discussion of the significant risk associated with the regulation of our business see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation discussion within that section change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on our business legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one which may significantly affect our business in addition in recent year the fcc and certain state have been more active in considering rulemakings and legislation regarding our service any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant in addition congress is expected to consider proposal to address communication issue including whether it should rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace whether it should address the fcc authority to implement or enforce open internet regulation and whether it should fund new broadband infrastructure we are unable to predict the effect of any of these or any other further legislative requirement on our business can we predict how the fcc or other agency under the new administration will address regulatory matter affecting our business any change to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our service or business could have negative impact on our business and result of operation programming expense for our video service are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communication segment video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be our cable communication segment largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry ha experienced continued increase in the cost of programming especially sport programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expense may also increase we add programming to our video service or distribute existing programming to more of our customer or through additional delivery platform such on demand or streaming service additionally in the past few year we have begun paying certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to raise our customer rate or offset programming cost increase through the sale of additional service the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term

before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance we also obtain significant portion of our content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right may result in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market our audience size the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharge or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider for the content and the timing and amount of our right payment there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the other cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content doe not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all our business may be adversely affected the loss of nbcuniversal programming distribution agreement or the renewal of

network doe not attract sufficient viewer multichannel video provider may decide not to distribute the network our broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain network affiliation agreement with third party local broadcast television station in the market where we do not own the affiliated local broadcast television station in addition every three year each of our owned local broadcast television station must elect with respect to it retransmission by multichannel video provider within it dma either must carry status in which the distributor carriage of the station is mandatory and doe not generate any compensation for the local station or retransmission consent in which the station give up it right to mandatory carriage and instead seek to negotiate the term and condition of carriage with the distributor including the amount of compensation if any paid to the station by such distributor all of our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television

result there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreement will be renewed in the future on acceptable term or at all the loss of any of these agreement or the renewal of these agreement

related to recent accounting pronouncement critical accounting judgment and estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the related disclosure of contingent asset and contingent liability we base our judgment on our historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making estimate about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we believe our judgment and related estimate associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise right and the accounting for film and television cost are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgment and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to them which are presented below see note and to comcast consolidated financial statement for discussion of our accounting policy with respect to these item valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise right our largest asset our cable franchise right result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market additional service such advanced video service and high speed internet and voice service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve approximately franchise area in the united state we have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right but ass the carrying value of our cable franchise right annually or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value impairment testing comcast annual report on form table of content for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible allows for the option to first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible is le than it carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factor that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not le than it carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information in we performed qualitative assessment of our cable franchise right at the time of our previous quantitative assessment in the estimated fair value of our franchise right exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communication division by and respectively we also considered various factor that would affect the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right in our qualitative assessment in including change in our projected future cash flow associated with our cable communication segment market transaction and macroeconomic condition weighted average cost of capital and an increase in our market capitalization based on this assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right were higher than the carrying value and that the performance of quantitative impairment test wa not required since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible asset in we have not recorded any significant impairment charge to cable franchise right result of our impairment testing we could record impairment charge in the future if there are change in long term market condition in expected future operating result or in federal or state regulation that prevent from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise right assumption made about increased competition and economic condition could also impact the result of any qualitative assessment and the valuation used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in reduction in the fair value of our cable franchise right in addition future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge film and television cost we capitalize film and television production cost including direct cost production overhead print cost development cost and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production cost including acquired library and accrue cost associated with participation and residual payment to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued cost using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes the cost using the ratio of the current period revenue to estimated total remaining revenue from all source ultimate revenue estimate of ultimate revenue have significant impact on how quickly capitalized cost are amortized and therefore are updated regularly our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding comcast annual report on form table of content market including from content licensing across multiple platform and home entertainment sale are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platform revenue estimate for these platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of programming content that we license but do not own including right to multiyear live event sport programming at the earlier of when payment are made for the programming or when the license period begin and the content is made available for use we amortize capitalized programming cost the associated program are broadcast we generally amortize multiyear live event sport programming right using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the term of the contract capitalized film and television cost well stage play production cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified if the fair value of production were to fall below it unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized cost exceed the production fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flow which are supported by our internal forecast adjustment to capitalized film and stage play production cost of million million and million were recorded in and respectively item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk
