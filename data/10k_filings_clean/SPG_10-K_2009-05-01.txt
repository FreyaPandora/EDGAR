change excluding gain and loss from the sale of previously depreciated operating property plus the allocable portion of ffo of unconsolidated entity accounted for under the equity method of accounting based upon economic ownership interest and all determined on consistent basis in accordance with gaap we have adopted nareit clarification of the definition of ffo that requires to include the effect of nonrecurring item not classified extraordinary cumulative effect of accounting change or gain or loss resulting from the sale of previously depreciated operating property we include in ffo gain and loss realized from the sale of land outlot building marketable and non marketable security and investment holding of non retail real estate however you should understand that our computation of ffo might not be comparable to ffo reported by other reit and that ffo doe not represent cash flow from operation defined by gaap should not be considered an alternative to consolidated net income determined in accordance with gaap measure of operating performance and is not an alternative to cash flow measure of liquidity the following schedule set forth total ffo before allocation to the
