economic environment change in sale and implementation cycle for our product and reduced visibility into our customer spending plan and associated revenue our ability to maintain appropriate inventory level and purchase commitment price and product competition in the communication and networking industry which can change rapidly due to technological innovation and different business model from

of the world including result of the on going russia and ukraine war and china taiwan relation the current economic challenge in china including global economic ramification of chinese economic difficulty and other disruption may continue to put pressure on global economic condition if global economic and market condition or economic condition in key market remain uncertain or deteriorate further we may experience material impact on our business operating result and financial condition our operating result in one or more segment may also be affected by uncertain or changing economic condition particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer market within that segment in addition report of certain intelligence gathering method of the government could affect customer perception of the product of it company which design and manufacture product in the united state trust and confidence in an it supplier are critical to the development and growth of our market impairment of that trust or foreign regulatory action taken in response to report of certain intelligence gathering method of the government could affect the demand for our product from customer outside of the united state and could have an adverse effect on our operating result our revenue for particular period is difficult to predict and shortfall in revenue may harm our operating result result of variety of factor discussed in this report our revenue for particular quarter is difficult to predict especially in light of challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment including result of the russia and ukraine war the significant impact of the covid pandemic and related market uncertainty our revenue may grow at slower rate than in past period it in the third quarter of fiscal on year over year basis or decline it did in the fourth quarter of fiscal and certain prior period our ability to meet financial expectation could also be adversely affected if the nonlinear sale pattern seen in some of our past quarter recurs in future period we have experienced period of time during which shipment have exceeded net booking or manufacturing issue have delayed shipment leading to nonlinearity in shipping pattern in addition to making it difficult to predict revenue for particular period nonlinearity in shipping can of contentsincrease cost because irregular shipment pattern result in period of underutilized capacity and period in which overtime expense may be incurred well in potential additional inventory management related cost in addition to the extent that manufacturing issue and any related component shortage result in delayed shipment in the future and particularly in period in which our contract manufacturer are operating at higher level of capacity it is possible that revenue for quarter could be adversely affected if such matter occur and are not remediated within the same quarter the timing of large order can also have significant effect on our business and operating result from quarter to quarter from time to time we receive large order that have significant effect on our operating result in the period in which the order is recognized revenue the timing of such order is difficult to predict and the timing of revenue recognition from such order may affect period to period change in revenue result our operating result could vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such order and their ultimate recognition revenue longer than normal manufacturing lead time in the past have caused and in the future could cause some customer to place the same or similar order multiple time within our various sale channel and to cancel the duplicative order upon shipment or receipt of the product or to also place order with other vendor with shorter manufacturing lead time such multiple ordering along with other factor or risk of order cancellation may cause difficulty in predicting our revenue further our effort to improve manufacturing lead time performance may result in more variability and le predictability in our revenue and operating result in addition when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation which in turn contribute to an increase in inventory and purchase commitment in recent period we increased our inventory and purchase commitment in light of the significant supply constraint seen industry wide due to component shortage caused in part by the covid pandemic these increase in our inventory and purchase commitment to shorten lead time could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charge in future period if the demand for our product is le than our expectation we plan our operating expense level based primarily on forecasted revenue level these expense and the impact of long term commitment are relatively fixed in the short term shortfall in revenue could lead to operating result being below expectation because we may not be able to quickly reduce these fixed expense in response to short term business change any of the factor could have material adverse impact on our operation and financial result for additional information and further discussion of current impact and risk related to our significant supply constraint inventory commitment and our purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier see result of operation product gross margin supply constraint impact and risk liquidity and capital resource inventory supply chain and note to the consolidated financial statement supply chain issue including financial problem of contract manufacturer or component supplier or shortage of adequate component supply or manufacturing capacity that increase our cost or cause delay in our ability to fulfill order could have an adverse impact on our business and operating result and our failure to estimate customer demand properly may result in excess or obsolete component supply which could adversely affect our gross margin the fact that we do not own or operate the bulk of our manufacturing facility and that we are reliant on our extended supply chain could have an adverse impact on the supply of our product and on our business and operating result financial problem of either contract manufacturer or component supplier reservation of manufacturing capacity at our contract manufacturer by other company and industry consolidation occurring within one or more component supplier market such the semiconductor market in each case could either limit supply or increase cost reduction or interruption in supply including disruption on our global supply chain caused in part by public health emergency including the covid pandemic geopolitical tension including result of china taiwan relation or significant natural disaster including result of climate change significant increase in the price of one or more component including result of inflation failure to adequately authorize procurement of inventory by our contract manufacturer failure to appropriately cancel reschedule or adjust our requirement based on our business need or decrease in demand for our product could materially adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition and could materially damage customer relationship furthermore result of binding price or purchase commitment with supplier we may be obligated to purchase component at price that are higher than those available in the current market in the event that we become committed to purchase component at price in excess of the current market price when the component are actually used our gross margin could decrease in addition vendor may be under pressure to allocate product to certain customer for business regulatory or political reason and or demand change in agreed pricing condition of supply although we have generally secured additional supply or taken other mitigation action when significant disruption have occurred if similar situation occur in the future they could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our growth and ability to meet customer demand depend in part on our ability to obtain timely delivery of part from our supplier and contract manufacturer we have experienced component shortage in the past including shortage caused by manufacturing process issue that have affected our operation including longer than normal lead time there is currently market shortage of semiconductor and other component supply which ha affected and could further affect lead time the cost of contentsof that supply and our ability to meet customer demand for our product if we can not secure sufficient supply in timely manner we continue to manage through significant supply constraint seen industry wide due to component shortage including significant constraint with certain critical component which prevents from completing manufacturing of certain of our product for example we saw an additional unanticipated supply challenge with covid related lockdown in certain part of china in the second half of fiscal that resulted in severe shortage of certain critical component while we did see some easing of the industry wide supply constraint towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal we expect such constraint to continue and the duration of which is uncertain additionally we may in the future experience shortage of certain component part result of our own manufacturing issue manufacturing issue at our supplier or contract manufacturer capacity problem experienced by our supplier or contract manufacturer including capacity or cost problem resulting from industry consolidation or strong demand for those part growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressure on and our supplier to accurately project overall component demand and component demand within specific product category and to establish optimal component level and manufacturing capacity especially for labor intensive component component for which we purchase substantial portion of the supply or the ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex product during period of shortage or delay the price of component may increase or the component may not be available at all and we may also encounter shortage if we do not accurately anticipate our need we may not be able to secure enough component at reasonable price or of acceptable quality to build new product in timely manner in the quantity or configuration needed accordingly our revenue and gross margin could suffer until other source can be developed our operating result would also be adversely affected if anticipating greater demand than actually develops we commit to the purchase of more component than we need which is more likely to occur in period of demand uncertainty such we are currently experiencing there can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problem in the future although in many case we use standard part and component for our product certain component are presently available only from single source or limited source and global economic downturn and related market uncertainty could negatively impact the availability of component from one or more of these source especially during time such we have recently seen when there are supplier constraint based on labor and other action taken during economic downturn we may not be able to diversify source in timely manner which could harm our ability to deliver product to customer and seriously impact present and future sale we believe that we may be faced with the following challenge in the future new market in which we participate may grow quickly which may make it difficult to quickly obtain significant component capacity we acquire company and new technology we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply partner and we face competition for certain component that are supply constrained from existing competitor and company in other market manufacturing capacity and component supply constraint could continue to be significant issue for we purchase component from variety of supplier and use several contract manufacturer to provide manufacturing service for our product during the normal course of business in order to improve manufacturing lead time performance and to help ensure adequate component supply we enter into agreement with contract manufacturer and supplier that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criterion defined by or that establish the parameter defining our requirement in certain instance these agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitment in recent period we increased our inventory and purchase commitment in light of the significant supply constraint seen industry wide due to component shortage caused in part by the covid pandemic these increase in our inventory and purchase commitment to shorten lead time could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charge in future period if the demand for our product is le than our expectation if we fail to anticipate customer demand properly an oversupply of part could result in excess or obsolete component that could adversely affect our gross margin for additional information and further discussion of current impact and risk related to our significant supply constraint inventory commitment and our purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier see result of operation product gross margin supply constraint impact and risk liquidity and capital resource inventory supply chain and note to the consolidated financial statement we expect gross margin to vary over time and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable our level of product gross margin declined in fiscal and have declined in certain prior period on year over year basis and could decline in future period due to adverse impact from various factor including change in customer geographic or product mix including mix of configuration within each product group introduction of new product including product with price performance advantage and new business model including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription of content our ability to reduce production cost entry into new market or growth in lower margin market including market with different pricing and cost structure through acquisition or internal development sale discount increase in material labor or other manufacturing related cost component cost broker fee expedited freight and overtime or higher supply chain logistics cost any of which could be significant especially during period of supply constraint for certain cost such those currently impacting the market for component including semiconductor and memory and which cost have in the past and may continue to be exacerbated by inflation excess inventory inventory holding charge and obsolescence charge change in shipment volume the timing of revenue recognition and revenue deferral increased cost including those caused by tariff or economic condition including inflation loss of cost saving or dilution of saving due to change in component pricing or charge incurred due to inventory holding period if part ordering doe not correctly anticipate product demand or if the financial health of either contract manufacturer or supplier deteriorates lower than expected benefit from value engineering increased price competition including competitor from asia especially from china change in distribution channel increased warranty or royalty cost increased amortization of purchased intangible asset especially from acquisition how well we execute on our strategy and operating planschanges in service gross margin may result from various factor such change in the mix between technical support service and advanced service well the timing of technical support service contract initiation and renewal and the addition of personnel and other resource to support higher level of service business in future period sale to the service provider market are especially volatile and weakness in order from this industry may harm our operating result and financial condition sale to the service provider market have been characterized by large and sporadic purchase especially relating to our router sale and sale of certain other secure agile network and collaboration product in addition to longer sale cycle service provider product order decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal and in certain prior period and at various time in the past including in recent quarter we have experienced significant weakness in product order from service provider product order from the service provider market could continue to decline and ha been the case in the past such weakness could persist over extended period of time given fluctuating market condition sale activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructure the availability of funding and the extent to which service provider are affected by regulatory economic and business condition in the country of operation weakness in order from this industry including result of any slowdown in capital expenditure by service provider which may be more prevalent during global economic downturn or period of economic political or regulatory uncertainty could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition such slowdown may continue or recur in future period order from this industry could decline for many reason other than the competitiveness of our product and service within their respective market for example in the past many of our service provider customer have been materially and adversely affected by slowdown in the general economy by overcapacity by change in the service provider market by regulatory development and by constraint on capital availability resulting in business failure and substantial reduction in spending and expansion plan these condition have materially harmed our business and operating result in the past and could affect our business and operating result in any future period finally service provider customer typically have longer implementation cycle require broader range of service including design service demand that vendor take on larger share of risk often require acceptance provision which can lead to delay in revenue recognition and expect financing from vendor all these factor can add further risk to business conducted with service provider disruption of or change in our distribution model could harm our sale and margin if we fail to manage distribution of our product and service properly or if our distributor financial condition or operation weaken our revenue and gross margin could be adversely affected substantial portion of our product and service is sold through our channel partner and the remainder is sold through direct sale our channel partner include system integrator service provider other resellers and distributor system integrator and service provider typically sell directly to end user and often provide system installation technical support professional service and other support service in addition to network of contentsequipment sale system integrator also typically integrate our product into an overall solution and number of service provider are also system integrator distributor stock inventory and typically sell to system integrator service provider and other resellers we refer to sale through distributor our two tier system of sale to the end customer if sale through indirect channel increase this may lead to greater difficulty in forecasting the mix of our product and to degree the timing of order from our customer historically we have seen fluctuation in our gross margin based on change in the balance of our distribution channel there can be no assurance that change in the balance of our distribution model in future period would not have an adverse effect on our gross margin and profitability some factor could result in disruption of or change in our distribution model which could harm our sale and margin including the following competition with some of our channel partner including through our direct sale which may lead these channel partner to use other supplier that do not directly sell their own product or otherwise compete with them some of our channel partner may demand that we absorb greater share of the risk that their customer may ask them to bear some of our channel partner may have insufficient financial resource and may not be able to withstand change and challenge in business condition and revenue from indirect sale could suffer if our distributor financial condition or operation weaken in addition we depend on our channel partner globally to comply with applicable regulatory requirement to the extent that they fail to do that could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition further sale of our product outside of agreed territory can result in disruption to our distribution channel the market in which we compete are intensely competitive which could adversely affect our achievement of revenue growth the market in which we compete are characterized by rapid change converging technology and migration to networking and communication solution that offer relative advantage these market factor represent competitive threat to we compete with numerous vendor in each product category the overall number of our competitor providing niche product solution may increase also the identity and composition of competitor may change we increase our activity in newer product area and in key priority and growth area for example product related to network programmability such software defined networking sdn product become more prevalent we expect to face increased competition from company that develop networking product based on commoditized hardware referred to white box hardware to the extent customer decide to purchase those product offering instead of in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered service enables new competitor to enter the market we continue to expand globally we may see new competition in different geographic region in particular we have experienced price focused competition from competitor in asia especially from china and we anticipate this will continue for information regarding our competitor see the section entitled competition contained in item business of this report some of our competitor compete across many of our product line while others are primarily focused in specific product area barrier to entry are relatively low and new venture to create product that do or could compete with our product are regularly formed in addition some of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do we expand into new market we will face competition not only from our existing competitor but also from other competitor including existing company with strong technological marketing and sale position in those market we also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributor of our product company with which we have strategic alliance in some area may be competitor in other area and this trend may increase for example the enterprise data center is undergoing fundamental transformation arising from the convergence of technology including computing networking storage and software that previously were segregated due to several factor including the availability of highly scalable and general purpose microprocessor asics offering advanced service standard based protocol cloud computing and virtualization the convergence of technology within the enterprise data center is spanning multiple previously independent technology segment also some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center result of all of these development we face greater competition in the development and sale of enterprise data center technology including competition from entity that are among our long term strategic alliance partner company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with the principal competitive factor in the market in which we presently compete and may compete in the future include the ability to sell successful business outcome the ability to provide broad range of networking and communication product and service product performance price the ability to introduce new product including providing continuous new customer value and product with price performance advantage the ability to reduce production cost the ability to provide value added feature such security reliability and investment protection conformance to standard market presence the ability to provide financing and disruptive technology shift and new business model of contentswe also face competition from customer to which we license or supply technology and supplier from which we transfer technology the inherent nature of networking requires interoperability such we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many company any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationship with customer supplier and strategic alliance partner could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition and accordingly affect our chance of success if we do not successfully manage our strategic alliance we may not realize the expected benefit from such alliance and we may experience increased competition or delay in product development we have several strategic alliance with large and complex organization and other company with which we work to offer complementary product and service these arrangement are generally limited to specific project the goal of which is generally to facilitate product compatibility and adoption of industry standard there can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefit from these strategic alliance or from joint venture if successful these relationship may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth however alliance carry an element of risk because in most case we must compete in some business area with company with which we have strategic alliance and at the same time cooperate with that company in other business area also if these company fail to perform or if these relationship fail to materialize expected we could suffer delay in product development or other operational difficulty joint venture can be difficult to manage given the potentially different interest of joint venture partner inventory management relating to our sale to our two tier distribution channel is complex and excess inventory may harm our gross margin we must manage inventory relating to sale to our distributor effectively because inventory held by them could affect our result of operation our distributor may increase order during period of product shortage cancel order if their inventory is too high or delay order in anticipation of new product they also may adjust their order in response to the supply of our product and the product of our competitor that are available to them and in response to seasonal fluctuation in end user demand our distributor are generally given business term that allow them to return portion of inventory receive credit for change in selling price and participate in various cooperative marketing program inventory management remains an area of focus we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory level to ensure competitive lead time against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement when facing component supply related challenge we have increased our effort in procuring component in order to meet customer expectation if we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory we may have to reduce our price and write inventory which in turn could result in lower gross margin we depend upon the development of new product and service and enhancement to existing product and service and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trend and customer changing need our operating result and market share may suffer the market for our product and service are characterized by rapidly changing technology evolving industry standard new product and service introduction and evolving method of building and operating network our operating result depend on our ability to develop and introduce new product and service into existing and emerging market and to reduce the production cost of existing product if customer do not purchase and or renew our offering our business could be harmed the covid pandemic may also result in long term change in customer need for our product and service in various sector along with it related capital spending reduction or shift in spending focus that could materially adversely affect if we are unable to adjust our product and service offering to match customer need the process of developing new technology including more programmable flexible and virtual network and technology related to other market transition such security digital transformation and iot and cloud is complex and uncertain and if we fail to accurately predict customer changing need and emerging technological trend our business could be harmed we must commit significant resource including the investment we have been making in our strategic priority to developing new product and service before knowing whether our investment will result in product and service the market will accept in particular if our model of the evolution of networking doe not emerge we believe it will or if the industry doe not evolve we believe it will or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful many of our strategic initiative and investment may be of no or limited value for example if we do not introduce product related to network programmability such software defined networking product in timely fashion or if product offering in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology that differs from ours such for example networking product based on white box hardware our business could be harmed similarly our business could be harmed if we fail to develop or fail to develop in timely fashion offering to address other transition or if the offering addressing these other transition that ultimately succeed are based on technology or an approach to technology different from ours in addition our business could be adversely affected in period surrounding our new product introduction if customer delay purchasing decision to qualify or otherwise evaluate the new product offering we have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual of contentsproducts and service to selling product and service integrated into architecture and solution and we are seeking to meet the evolving need of customer which include offering our product and solution in the manner in which customer wish to consume them part of this transformation we continue to make change to how we are organized and how we build and deliver our technology including change in our business model with customer if our strategy for addressing our customer need or the architecture and solution we develop do not meet those need or the change we are making in how we are organized and how we build and deliver or technology is incorrect or ineffective our business could be harmed furthermore we may not execute successfully on our vision or strategy because of challenge with regard to product planning and timing technical hurdle that we fail to overcome in timely fashion or lack of appropriate resource this could result in competitor some of which may also be our strategic alliance partner providing those solution before we do and loss of market share revenue and earnings in addition the growth in demand for technology delivered service enables new competitor to enter the market the success of new product and service depends on several factor including proper new product and service definition component cost timely completion and introduction of these product and service differentiation of new product and service from those of our competitor and market acceptance of these product and service there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and service opportunity develop and bring new product and service to market in timely manner or achieve market acceptance of our product and service or that product service and technology developed by others will not render our product service or technology obsolete or noncompetitive the product and technology in our other product category and key priority and growth area may not prove to have the market success we anticipate and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new product and service change in industry structure and market condition could lead to charge related to discontinuance of certain of our product or business asset impairment and workforce reduction or restructurings in response to change in industry and market condition we may be required to strategically realign our resource and to consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting business any resource realignment or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit business may result in the recording of special charge such inventory and technology related write offs workforce reduction or restructuring cost charge relating to consolidation of excess facility or claim from third party were resellers or user of discontinued product our estimate with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our carrying basis of asset including purchased intangible asset could change result of such assessment and decision although in certain instance our supply agreement allow the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirement based on our business need prior to firm order being placed our loss contingency may include liability for contract that we can not cancel with contract manufacturer and supplier further our estimate relating to the liability for excess facility are affected by change in real estate market condition additionally we are required to perform goodwill impairment test on an annual basis and between annual test in certain circumstance and future goodwill impairment test may result in charge to earnings we initiated restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal which included voluntary early retirement program which wa completed in fiscal our business may not be more efficient or effective than prior to implementation of the plan our restructuring activity including any related charge and the impact of the related headcount restructurings could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition over the long term we intend to invest in engineering sale service and marketing activity and in key priority and growth area and these investment may achieve delayed or lower than expected benefit which could harm our operating result while we intend to focus on managing our cost and expense over the long term we also intend to invest in personnel and other resource related to our engineering sale service and marketing function we realign and dedicate resource on key priority and growth area such end to end security and internet for the future and we also intend to focus on maintaining leadership in secure agile network and in service we are likely to recognize the cost associated with these investment earlier than some of the anticipated benefit and the return on these investment may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect if we do not achieve the benefit anticipated from these investment including if our selection of area for investment doe not play out we expect or if the achievement of these benefit is delayed our operating result may be adversely affected of contentswe have made and expect to continue to make acquisition that could disrupt our operation and harm our operating result our growth depends upon market growth our ability to enhance our existing product and our ability to introduce new product on timely basis we intend to continue to address the need to develop new product and enhance existing product through acquisition of other company product line technology and personnel acquisition involve numerous risk including the following difficulty in integrating the operation system technology product and personnel of the acquired company particularly company with large and widespread operation and or complex product diversion of management attention from normal daily operation of the business and the challenge of managing larger and more widespread operation resulting from acquisition potential difficulty in completing project associated with in process research and development intangible difficulty in entering market in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitor in such market have stronger market position initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chain or relatively small supply partner insufficient revenue to offset increased expense associated with acquisition the potential loss of key employee customer distributor vendor and other business partner of the company we acquire following and continuing after announcement of acquisition plansacquisitions may also cause to issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholder percentage ownership use substantial portion of our cash resource or incur debt significantly increase our interest expense leverage and debt service requirement if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition assume liability record goodwill and intangible asset that are subject to impairment testing on regular basis and potential periodic impairment charge incur amortization expense related to certain intangible asset incur tax expense related to the effect of acquisition on our legal structure incur large write offs and restructuring and other related expense become subject to intellectual property or other litigationmergers and acquisition of high technology company are inherently risky and subject to many factor outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our previous or future acquisition will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operating result or financial condition failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisition could materially harm our business and operating result prior acquisition have resulted in wide range of outcome from successful introduction of new product and technology to failure to do so even when an acquired company ha already developed and marketed product there can be no assurance that product enhancement will be made in timely fashion or that pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all possible issue that might arise with respect to such product in addition our effective tax rate for future period is uncertain and could be impacted by merger and acquisition risk related to new product development also apply to acquisition entrance into new or developing market expose to additional competition and will likely increase demand on our service and support operation we focus on new market opportunity and key priority and growth area we will increasingly compete with large telecommunication equipment supplier well startup company several of our competitor may have greater resource including technical and engineering resource than we do additionally customer in these market complete infrastructure deployment they may require greater level of service support and financing than we have provided in the past especially in emerging country demand for these type of service support or financing contract may increase in the future there can be no assurance that we can provide product service support and financing to effectively compete for these market opportunity further entry into other market ha subjected and will subject to additional risk particularly to those market including the effect of general market condition and reduced consumer confidence for example we add direct selling capability globally to meet changing customer demand we will face increased legal and regulatory requirement of contentsindustry consolidation may lead to increased competition and may harm our operating result there is continuing trend toward industry consolidation in our market we expect this trend to continue company attempt to strengthen or hold their market position in an evolving industry and company are acquired or are unable to continue operation for example some of our current and potential competitor for enterprise data center business have made acquisition or announced new strategic alliance designed to position them with the ability to provide end to end technology solution for the enterprise data center company that are strategic alliance partner in some area of our business may acquire or form alliance with our competitor thereby reducing their business with we believe that industry consolidation may result in stronger competitor that are better able to compete sole source vendor for customer this could lead to more variability in our operating result and could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition furthermore particularly in the service provider market rapid consolidation will lead to fewer customer with the effect that loss of major customer could have material impact on result not anticipated in customer marketplace composed of more numerous participant product quality problem could lead to reduced revenue gross margin and net income we produce highly complex product that incorporate leading edge technology including both hardware and software software typically contains bug that can unexpectedly interfere with expected operation there can be no assurance that our pre shipment testing program will be adequate to detect all defect either one in individual product or one that could affect numerous shipment which might interfere with customer satisfaction reduce sale opportunity or affect gross margin from time to time we have had to replace certain component and provide remediation in response to the discovery of defect or bug in product that we had shipped there can be no assurance that such remediation depending on the product involved would not have material impact an inability to cure product defect could result in the failure of product line temporary or permanent withdrawal from product or market damage to our reputation inventory cost or product reengineering expense any of which could have material impact on our revenue margin and net income due to the global nature of our operation political or economic change or other factor in specific country or region could harm our operating result and financial condition we conduct significant sale and customer support operation in country around the world such our growth depends in part on our increasing sale into emerging country we also depend on non operation of our contract manufacturer component supplier and distribution partner our business in emerging country in the aggregate experienced decline in order in certain prior period we continue to ass the sustainability of any improvement in our business in these country and there can be no assurance that our investment in these country will be successful our future result could be materially adversely affected by variety of political economic or other factor relating to our operation inside and outside the united state any or all of which could have material adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition including the following impact from global central bank monetary policy issue related to the political relationship between the united state and other country that can affect regulatory matter affect the willingness of customer in those country to purchase product from company headquartered in the united state or affect our ability to procure component if government body were to deny access to those component government related disruption or shutdown the challenging and inconsistent global macroeconomic environment foreign currency exchange rate geopolitical tension including china taiwan relation political or social unrest economic instability or weakness or natural disaster in specific country or region including economic challenge in china and global economic ramification of chinese economic difficulty environmental protection regulation including new law and regulation related to climate change trade protection measure such tariff and other legal and regulatory requirement some of which may affect our ability to import our product to export our product from or sell our product in various country or affect our ability to procure component political consideration that affect service provider and government spending pattern health or similar issue including pandemic or epidemic such the covid pandemic which could continue to affect customer purchasing decision difficulty in staffing and managing international operation and adverse tax consequence including imposition of withholding or other tax on our global operation we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customer and to credit exposure in weakened market which could result in material loss most of our sale are on an open credit basis with typical payment term of day in the united state and because of local custom or condition longer in some market outside the united state beyond our open credit arrangement we have also experienced demand for customer financing and facilitation of leasing arrangement our loan financing arrangement may include not only financing the acquisition of our product and service but also providing additional fund for other cost associated with network installation and integration of our product and service our exposure to the credit risk relating to our financing activity may increase if our customer are adversely affected by global economic downturn or period of economic uncertainty there can be no assurance that program we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risk will be effective in the past there have been significant bankruptcy among customer both on open credit and with loan or lease financing of contentsarrangements particularly among internet business and service provider causing to incur economic or financial loss there can be no assurance that additional loss will not be incurred although these loss have not been material to date future loss if incurred could harm our business and have material adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition additionally to the degree that turmoil in the credit market make it more difficult for some customer to obtain financing those customer ability to pay could be adversely impacted which in turn could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition we are exposed to fluctuation in the market value of our portfolio investment and in interest rate impairment of our investment could harm our earnings we maintain an investment portfolio of various holding type and maturity our portfolio includes available for sale debt investment and equity investment the value of which are subject to market price volatility if such investment suffer market price decline we experienced with some of our investment in the past we may recognize in earnings the decline in the fair value of our investment below their cost basis our privately held investment are subject to risk of loss of investment capital these investment are inherently risky because the market for the technology or

to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax there can be no assurance that the outcome from these continuous examination will not have an adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition our business and operation are especially subject to the risk of earthquake flood and other natural catastrophic event including result of global climate change our corporate headquarters including certain of our research and development operation are located in the silicon valley area of northern california region known for seismic activity additionally certain number of our facility are located near river that have experienced flooding in the past also certain of our customer supplier and logistics center are located in region that have been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding or other weather related activity which in the past ha disrupted and in the future could disrupt the flow of component and delivery of product in addition global climate change may result in significant natural disaster occurring more frequently or with greater intensity such drought wildfire storm sea level rise and flooding we have not to date experienced material event to these matter however the occurrence of any such event in the future could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition terrorism war and other event may harm our business operating result and financial condition the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto or any other current or future act of terrorism war such the on going russia and ukraine war and other event such economic sanction and trade restriction including those related to the on going russia and ukraine war may cause further disruption to the economy of the united state and other country and create further uncertainty or could otherwise negatively impact our business operating result and financial condition likewise event such loss of infrastructure and utility service such energy transportation or telecommunication could have similar negative impact to the extent that such disruption or uncertainty result in delay or cancellation of customer order or the manufacture or shipment of our product our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation overview russia and ukraine war for discussion of the impact on cisco business of the on going russia and ukraine war there can be no assurance that our operating result and financial condition will not be adversely affected by our incurrence of debt of the end of fiscal we have senior unsecured note outstanding in an aggregate principal amount of billion that mature at specific date from calendar year through we have also established commercial paper program under which we may issue short term unsecured commercial paper note on private placement basis up to maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of billion and we had billion in commercial paper note outstanding under this program of july there can be no assurance that our incurrence of this debt or any future debt will be better mean of providing liquidity to than would our use of our existing cash resource further we can not be assured that our maintenance of this indebtedness or incurrence of future indebtedness will not adversely affect our operating result or financial condition in addition change by any rating agency to our credit rating can negatively impact the value and liquidity of both of contentsour debt and equity security well the term upon which we may borrow under our commercial paper program or future debt issuance our reputation and or business could be negatively impacted by esg matter and or our reporting of such matter there is an increasing focus from regulator certain investor and other stakeholder concerning environmental social and governance esg matter both in the united state and internationally we communicate certain esg related initiative goal and or commitment regarding environmental matter diversity responsible sourcing and social investment and other matter in our annual purpose report on our website in our filing with the sec and elsewhere these initiative goal or commitment could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement for example in september we announced our commitment to achieve net zero across all scope of greenhouse gas emission by the achievement of which relies in large part on the accuracy of our estimate and assumption around the enhanced power efficiency of our product the adoption of renewable energy at customer site and the adoption of certain of our product and service by our customer we could fail to achieve or be perceived to fail to achieve our net zero commitment or other esg related initiative goal or commitment in addition we could be criticized for the timing scope or nature of these initiative goal or commitment or for any revision to them to the extent that our required and voluntary disclosure about esg matter increase we could be criticized for the accuracy adequacy or completeness of such disclosure our actual or perceived failure to achieve our esg related initiative goal or commitment could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business risk related to intellectual propertyour proprietary right may prove difficult to enforce we generally rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law to establish and maintain proprietary right in our technology and product although we have been issued numerous patent and other patent application are currently pending there can be no assurance that any of these patent or other proprietary right will not be challenged invalidated or circumvented or that our right will in fact provide competitive advantage to furthermore many key aspect of networking technology are governed by industrywide standard which are usable by all market entrant in addition there can be no assurance that patent will be issued from pending application or that claim allowed on any patent will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology in addition the law of some foreign country may not protect our proprietary right to the same extent do the law of the united state the outcome of any action taken in these foreign country may be different than if such action were determined under the law of the united state although we are not dependent on any individual patent or group of patent for particular segment of the business for which we compete if we are unable to protect our proprietary right to the totality of the feature including aspect of product protected other than by patent right in market we may find at competitive disadvantage to others who need not incur the substantial expense time and effort required to create innovative product that have enabled to be successful we may be found to infringe on intellectual property right of others third party including customer have in the past and may in the future assert claim or initiate litigation related to exclusive patent copyright trademark and other intellectual property right to technology and related standard that are relevant to these assertion have increased over time result of our growth and the general increase in the pace of patent claim assertion particularly in the united state because of the existence of large number of patent in the networking field the secrecy of some pending patent and the rapid rate of issuance of new patent it is not economically practical or even possible to determine in advance whether product or any of it component infringes or will infringe on the patent right of others the asserted claim and or initiated litigation can include claim against or our manufacturer supplier or customer alleging infringement of their proprietary right with respect to our existing or future product or component of those product regardless of the merit of these claim they can be time consuming result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require to develop non infringing technology or enter into license agreement where claim are made by customer resistance even to unmeritorious claim could damage customer relationship there can be no assurance that license will be available on acceptable term and condition if at all or that our indemnification by our supplier will be adequate to cover our cost if claim were brought directly against or our customer furthermore because of the potential for high court award that are not necessarily predictable it is not unusual to find even arguably unmeritorious claim settled for significant amount if any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against by any third party is successful if we are required to indemnify customer with respect to claim against the customer or if we fail to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary right on commercially reasonable term and condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected for additional information regarding our indemnification obligation see note to the consolidated financial statement contained in this report our exposure to risk associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased result of acquisition we have lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risk further in the of contentspast third party have made infringement and similar claim after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition we rely on the availability of third party license many of our product are designed to include software or other intellectual property licensed from third party it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew license relating to various aspect of these product there can be no assurance that the necessary license would be available on acceptable term if at all the inability to obtain certain license or other right or to obtain such license or right on favorable term or the need to engage in litigation regarding these matter could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition moreover the inclusion in our product of software or other intellectual property licensed from third party on nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary right in our product risk related to cybersecurity privacy and regulatory requirementscyber attack data breach or malware may disrupt our operation harm our operating result and financial condition and damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business and cyber attack or data breach on our customer or third party provider network or in cloud based service provided to by or enabled by could result in claim of liability against give rise to legal and or regulatory action damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business we experience cyber attack and other attempt to gain unauthorized access to our product service and it environment on regular basis and we anticipate continuing to be subject to such attempt cyber attack become increasingly sophisticated and more difficult to predict and protect against despite our implementation of security measure our product and service and ii the server data center and cloud based solution on which our and third party data is stored or processed including server data center and cloud based solution operated by third party on which we rely collectively our it environment are vulnerable to cyber attack data breach malware inadvertent error disruption from unauthorized access tampering or other theft or misuse including by employee contingent worker malicious actor or nation state or their agent which cyber attack or related activity may intensify during period of diplomatic or armed conflict such the russia and ukraine war such

provider we rely on or result in confidential information stored on our system our customer system or other third party system being improperly accessed processed disclosed not or in the future or be lost or stolen for example in december multiple vulnerability were reported for the widely used java logging library apache we reviewed the use of this library within our product and service it use in our enterprise it environment and it use by our third party provider and have taken step to mitigate these vulnerability including by providing security update for affected product to our customer we have not to date experienced material event related to cybersecurity matter however the occurrence of any such event in the future could subject to liability to our customer data subject supplier business partner employee and others give rise to legal and or regulatory action could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business any of which could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition effort to limit the ability of malicious actor to disrupt the operation of the internet or undermine our own security effort are costly to implement and may not be successful breach of security in our customer or third party provider network in third party product we use or in cloud based service provided to by or enabled by regardless of whether the breach is attributable to vulnerability in our product or service or failure to maintain the digital security infrastructure or security tool that protect the integrity of our product service and it environment could in each case result in claim of liability against damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business vulnerability and critical security defect prioritization decision regarding remedying vulnerability or security defect failure of third party provider to remedy vulnerability or security defect or customer not deploying security update in timely manner or deciding not to upgrade product service or solution could result in claim of liability against damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business the product and service we sell to customer and our cloud based solution inevitably contain vulnerability or security defect which have not been remedied and can not be disclosed without compromising security we also make prioritization decision in determining which vulnerability or security defect to fix and the timing of these fix customer may also need to test security update before they can be deployed which can delay implementation when customer do not deploy security update in timely manner or decide not to upgrade to the latest version of our product service or cloud based solution containing the security update they may be left vulnerable in addition we rely on third party provider of software and cloud based service on which our and third party data is stored or processed and we can not control the timing at which third party provider remedy vulnerability which could leave vulnerable vulnerability and security defect prioritization error in remedying vulnerability or security defect failure of third party provider to remedy vulnerability or security defect or of contentscustomers not deploying security update in timely manner or deciding not to upgrade product service or solution could result in claim of liability against damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claim of liability against damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of business global privacy and data protection related law and regulation are evolving extensive and complex compliance with these law and regulation is difficult and costly in addition evolving legal requirement restricting or controlling the collection processing or cross border transmission of data including for regulation of cloud based service could materially affect our customer ability to use and our ability to sell our product and service the interpretation and application of these law in some instance is uncertain and our legal and regulatory obligation are subject to frequent change for example the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr applies to our activity conducted from an establishment in the eu or related to product and service offered in the eu and imposes range of compliance obligation regarding the handling of personal data additionally we are subject to california consumer privacy act and other law regulation and obligation that relate to the handling of personal data our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable law and regulation or other obligation relating to personal data or to protect personal data from unauthorized access use or other processing could subject to liability to our customer data subject supplier business partner employee and others give rise to legal and or regulatory action could damage our reputation or could otherwise materially harm our business any of which could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligation applicable to our product and service change in regulatory requirement applicable to the industry in which we operate in the united state and in other country could materially affect the sale of our product and service in particular economic sanction and change to export control requirement have impacted and may continue to impact our ability to sell and support our product and service in certain jurisdiction in addition change in telecommunication regulation could impact our service provider customer purchase of our product and service and they could also impact sale of our own regulated offering additional area of uncertainty that could impact sale of our product and service include law and regulation related to encryption technology environmental sustainability including climate change human right product certification and national security control applicable to our supply chain for example new law and regulation in response to climate change could result in increased energy efficiency requirement for our product and increased compliance and energy cost change in regulatory requirement in any of these area could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition risk related to ownership of our stockour stock price may be volatile historically our common stock ha experienced substantial price volatility particularly result of variation between our actual financial result and the published expectation of analyst and result of announcement by our competitor and furthermore speculation in the press or investment community about our strategic position

volume fluctuation that have affected the market price of many technology company in particular and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these company these factor well general economic and political condition and the announcement of proposed and completed acquisition or other significant transaction or any difficulty associated with such transaction by or our

requires to make judgment assumption and estimate that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note note to the consolidated financial statement describes the significant accounting policy and method used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement the accounting policy described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimate such accounting policy require significant judgment assumption and estimate used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statement and actual result could differ materially from the amount reported based on these policy the input into certain of our judgment assumption and estimate considered the economic implication of the covid pandemic including the associated impact of supply constraint on our critical and significant accounting estimate the covid pandemic did not have material impact on our significant judgment assumption and estimate that are reflected in our result for fiscal these estimate include goodwill and identified purchased intangible asset and income tax among other item the actual result that we experience may differ materially from our estimate the covid pandemic continues many of our estimate could require increased judgment and carry higher degree of variability and volatility event continue to evolve our estimate may change materially in future period revenue recognition we enter into contract with customer that can include various combination of product and service which are generally distinct and accounted for separate performance obligation result our contract may contain multiple performance obligation we determine whether arrangement are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on it own or together with other resource that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligation in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software license and saas distinct performance obligation term software license represent multiple obligation which include software license and software maintenance in transaction where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and cost of good sold on gross basis we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised good or service in contract with customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those product or service transfer of control occurs once the customer ha the contractual right to use the product generally upon shipment electronic delivery or when the software is available for download by the customer or once title and risk of loss ha transferred to the customer transfer of control can also occur over time for software maintenance and service the customer receives the benefit over the contract term our hardware and perpetual software license are distinct performance obligation where revenue is recognized upfront upon transfer of control term software license include multiple performance obligation where the term license are recognized upfront upon transfer of control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term service and software update are provided saas arrangement do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term the customer consumes the service on our product sale we record consideration from shipping and handling on gross basis within net product sale we record our revenue net of any associated sale tax revenue is allocated among these performance obligation in manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised good or service based on standalone selling price ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of product or service when we sell the good separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer in instance where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we ass relevant contractual term in our customer contract to determine the transaction price we apply judgment in identifying contractual term and determining the transaction price we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalty and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive program that we offer to our distributor channel partner and customer when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these program applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period actual utilization becomes available we also consider the customer right of return in determining the transaction price where applicable if actual credit received by distributor under these program were to deviate significantly from our estimate which are based on historical experience our revenue could be adversely affected see note to the consolidated financial statement for more detail of contentsinventory valuation and liability for purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and suppliersinventory is written down based on excess and obsolete inventory determined primarily by future demand forecast inventory write down are measured the difference between the cost of the inventory and net realizable value based upon assumption about future demand and are charged to the provision for inventory which is component of our cost of sale at the point of the loss recognition new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis we record liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier for quantity in excess of our future demand forecast consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory our provision for inventory wa million million and million in fiscal and respectively the provision for the liability related to purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier wa million million and million in fiscal and respectively if there were to be sudden and significant decrease in demand for our product or if there were higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirement or if supply constraint were to continue we could be required to increase our inventory write down and our liability for purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier and accordingly our profitability could be adversely affected we regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write down and the adequacy of our liability for purchase commitment we continue to manage through significant supply constraint seen industry wide due to component shortage caused in part by the covid pandemic for further discussion around the supply constraint impact and risk see result of operation gross margin supply constraint impact and risk and liquidity and capital resource inventory supply chain loss contingencieswe are subject to the possibility of various loss arising in the ordinary course of business we consider the likelihood of the incurrence of liability well our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining loss contingency an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably

condition our business operating result and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairmentsour methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisition is determined through established valuation technique goodwill represents residual value of the acquisition date which in most case result in measuring goodwill an excess of the purchase consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquired company over the fair value of net asset acquired including contingent consideration we perform goodwill impairment test on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and between annual test in certain circumstance for each reporting unit the assessment of fair value for goodwill and purchased intangible asset is based on factor that market participant would use in an orderly transaction in accordance with the new accounting guidance for the fair value measurement of nonfinancial asset in response to change in industry and market condition we could be required to strategically realign our resource and consider restructuring disposing of or otherwise exiting business which could result in an impairment of goodwill there wa no impairment of goodwill in fiscal and for the annual impairment testing in fiscal the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for each of our reporting unit wa billion for the america billion for emea and billion for apjc during the fourth quarter of fiscal we performed sensitivity analysis for goodwill impairment with respect to each of our respective reporting unit and determined that hypothetical decline in the fair value of each reporting unit would not result in an impairment of goodwill for any reporting unit the fair value of acquired technology and patent well acquired technology under development is determined at acquisition date primarily using the income approach which discount expected future cash flow to present value the discount rate used in the present value calculation are typically derived from weighted average cost of capital analysis and of contentsthen adjusted to reflect risk inherent in the development lifecycle appropriate we consider the pricing model for product related to these acquisition to be standard within the high technology communication industry and the applicable discount rate represent the rate that market participant would use for valuation of such intangible asset we make judgment about the recoverability of purchased intangible asset with finite life whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that an impairment may exist recoverability of purchased intangible asset with finite life is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset is expected to generate we review indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually or whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset might be impaired if the asset is considered to be impaired the amount of any impairment is measured the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset assumption and estimate about future value and remaining useful life of our purchased intangible asset are complex and subjective they can be affected by variety of factor including external factor such industry and economic trend and internal factor such change in our business strategy and our internal forecast our impairment charge related to purchased intangible asset were million for fiscal our ongoing consideration of all the factor described previously could result in impairment charge in the future which could adversely affect our net income income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the united

and charged to the provision for inventory which is component of cost of sale at the point of the loss recognition new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis in addition we record liability for firm noncancelable and unconditional purchase commitment with contract manufacturer and supplier for quantity in excess of our future demand forecast consistent with our valuation of excess and obsolete inventory allowance for account receivable contract asset and financing receivables we estimate our allowance for credit loss using relevant available information from internal and external source related to past event current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit loss when assessing for credit loss we determine collectibility by pooling our asset with similar characteristic the allowance for credit loss are each measured on collective basis when similar risk characteristic exist our internal credit risk rating are categorized through with the lowest credit risk rating representing the highest quality asset that do not share risk characteristic are evaluated on an individual basis the allowance for credit loss are each measured by multiplying the exposure probability of default the probability the asset will default within given time frame by the loss given default rate the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected

and also may include additional fund for other cost associated with network installation and integration of our product and service loan receivables and financed service contract have term of one year to three year on average outstanding financing receivables that are aged day or more from the contractual payment date are considered past due we do not accrue interest on financing receivables that are considered impaired and more than day past due unless either the receivable ha not been collected due to administrative reason or the receivable is well secured and in the process of collection financing receivables may be placed on nonaccrual status earlier if in management opinion timely collection of the full principal and interest becomes uncertain after financing receivable ha been categorized nonaccrual interest will be recognized when cash is received financing receivable may be returned to accrual status after all of the customer delinquent balance of principal and interest have been settled and the customer remains current for an appropriate period we facilitate arrangement for third party financing extended to channel partner consisting of revolving short term financing generally with payment term ranging from to day in certain instance these financing arrangement result in transfer of our receivables to the third party the receivables are derecognized upon

requirement of the channel partner and in some case we guarantee portion of these arrangement we could be called upon to make payment under these guarantee in the event of nonpayment by the channel partner deferred revenue relating to these financing arrangement is recorded in accordance with revenue recognition policy or for the fair value of the financing guarantee lease we lease real estate information technology it and other equipment and vehicle we also have arrangement with certain supplier and contract manufacturer which includes the leasing of dedicated space and equipment cost our lease have the option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option of contentsas lessee we determine if an arrangement is lease at commencement our rou lease asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment related to the lease operating lease rou asset and liability are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payment over the lease term we use incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the commencement date to determine the present value of our lease payment certain of our lease agreement contain variable lease payment our variable lease payment can fluctuate depending on the level of activity or the cost of certain service where we have elected to combine lease and non lease component while these payment are not included part of our lease liability they are recognized variable lease expense in the period they are incurred we provide leasing of our equipment and complementary third party product primarily through our channel partner and distributor for which the income arising from these lease is recognized through interest income lessor we determine if an arrangement is lease at inception we provide leasing arrangement for our equipment to certain qualified customer our lease

allocate the fair value of the purchase consideration of our acquisition to the tangible asset liability and intangible asset acquired including in process research and development ipr based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill ipr is initially capitalized at fair value an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter when an ipr project is completed the ipr is reclassified an amortizable purchased intangible asset and amortized over the asset estimated useful life acquisition related expense and related restructuring cost are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed incurred goodwill and purchased intangible asset goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter and when specific circumstance dictate between annual test when impaired the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value identifying potential impairment consists of comparing the fair value of reporting unit with it carrying amount including goodwill purchased intangible asset with finite life are carried at cost le accumulated amortization amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of the respective asset see long lived asset for our policy regarding impairment testing of purchased intangible asset with finite life purchased intangible asset with indefinite life are assessed for potential impairment annually or when event or circumstance indicate that their carrying amount might be impaired long lived asset long lived asset that are held and used by are reviewed for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable determination of recoverability of long lived asset is based on an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flow resulting from the use of the asset and it eventual disposition measurement of an impairment loss for long lived asset that management expects to hold and use is based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying value long lived asset to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value le cost to sell of content fair value fair value is defined the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and we also consider assumption that market participant would use when pricing the asset or liability the accounting guidance for fair value measurement requires an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value the standard establishes fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent objective evidence surrounding the input used to measure fair value financial instrument categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the fair value hierarchy is follows level applies to asset or liability for which there are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level applies to asset or liability for which there are input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability such quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market quoted price for identical asset or liability in market with insufficient volume or infrequent transaction le active market or model derived valuation in which significant input are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data we use input such actual trade data benchmark yield broker dealer quote and other similar data which are obtained from quoted market price independent pricing vendor or other source to determine the ultimate fair value of asset or liability level applies to asset or liability for which there are unobservable input to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability the fair value are determined based on model based technique such discounted cash flow model using input that we could not corroborate with market data derivative instrument we recognize derivative instrument either asset or liability and measure those instrument at fair value the accounting for change in the fair value of derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation for derivative instrument designated fair value hedge the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk being hedged for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge the gain or loss is initially reported component of aoci and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged exposure affect earnings for derivative instrument designated net investment hedge of our foreign operation the gain or loss is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within aoci together with the offsetting loss or gain of the hedged exposure of the underlying foreign operation for derivative instrument that are not designated accounting hedge change in fair value are recognized in earnings in the period of change we record derivative instrument in the statement of cash flow to operating investing or financing activity consistent with the cash flow of the hedged item hedge effectiveness for foreign exchange forward contract used cash flow hedge is assessed by comparing the change in the fair value of the hedge contract with the change in the fair value of the forecasted cash flow of the hedged item hedge effectiveness for equity forward contract and foreign exchange net investment hedge forward contract is assessed by comparing change in fair value due to change in spot rate for both the derivative and the hedged item for foreign exchange option contract hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the hedging instrument entire change in fair value hedge effectiveness for interest rate swap is assessed by comparing the change in fair value of the swap with the change in the fair value of the hedged item due to change in the benchmark interest rate foreign currency translation asset and liability of non subsidiary that operate in local currency environment where that local currency is the functional currency are translated to dollar at exchange

minimal credit risk we seek to mitigate our credit risk by spreading such risk across multiple counterparties and monitoring the risk profile of these counterparties we perform ongoing credit evaluation of our customer and with the exception of certain financing transaction do not require collateral from our customer we receive certain of our component from sole supplier additionally we rely on limited number of contract manufacturer and supplier to provide manufacturing service for our product the inability of contract manufacturer or supplier to fulfill our supply requirement could materially impact future operating result of content revenue recognition we enter into contract with customer that can include various combination of product and service which are generally distinct and accounted for separate performance obligation result our contract may contain multiple performance obligation we determine whether arrangement are distinct based on whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on it own or together with other resource that are readily available and whether our commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligation in the contract we classify our hardware perpetual software license and saas distinct performance obligation term software license represent multiple obligation which include software license and software maintenance in transaction where we deliver hardware or software we are typically the principal and we record revenue and cost of good sold on gross basis we refer to our term software license security software license saas and associated service arrangement subscription offer we recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised good or service in

control with the associated software maintenance revenue recognized ratably over the contract term service and software update are provided saas arrangement do not include the right for the customer to take possession of the software during the term and therefore have one distinct performance obligation which is satisfied over time with revenue recognized ratably over the contract term the customer consumes the service on our product sale we record consideration from shipping and handling on gross basis within net product sale we record our revenue net of any associated sale tax an

recorded reduction of our account receivable and revenue significant judgment revenue is allocated among these performance obligation in manner that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to for the promised good or service based on standalone selling price ssp ssp is estimated for each distinct performance obligation and judgment may be required in their determination the best evidence of ssp is the observable price of product or service when we sell the good separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer in instance where ssp is not directly observable we determine ssp using information that may include market condition and other observable input we ass relevant contractual term in our customer contract to determine the transaction price we apply judgment in identifying contractual term and determining the transaction price we may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize variable consideration includes potential contractual penalty and various rebate cooperative marketing and other incentive program that we offer to our distributor channel partner and customer when determining the amount of revenue to recognize we estimate the expected usage of these program applying the expected value or most likely estimate and update the estimate at each reporting period actual

tax consequence of temporary difference between the tax base of asset and liability and their reported amount valuation allowance are recorded to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount that will more likely than not be realized we account for uncertainty in income tax using two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax position the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement we classify the liability for unrecognized tax benefit current to the extent that we anticipate payment or receipt of cash within one year interest and penalty related to uncertain tax position are recognized in the provision for income tax
