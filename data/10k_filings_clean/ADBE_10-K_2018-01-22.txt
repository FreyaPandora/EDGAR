looking statement below we discus some of the factor that could cause these difference these and many other factor described in this report could adversely affect our operation performance and financial condition if we can not continue to develop acquire market and offer new product and service or enhancement to existing product and service that meet customer requirement our operating result could suffer the process of developing and acquiring new technology product and service and enhancing existing offering is complex costly and uncertain if we fail to anticipate customer rapidly changing need and expectation or adapt to emerging technological trend our market share and result of operation could suffer we must make long term investment develop acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resource before knowing whether our prediction will accurately reflect customer demand for our product and service if we misjudge customer need in the future our new product and service may not succeed and our revenue and earnings may be harmed additionally any delay in the development acquisition marketing or launch of new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customer causing decline in our revenue earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position we offer our product on variety of hardware platform consumer continue to migrate from personal computer to tablet and mobile device if we can not continue adapting our product to tablet and mobile device or if our competitor can adapt their product more quickly than our business could be harmed release of new device or operating system may make it more difficult for our product to perform or may require significant cost in order for to adapt our solution to such device or operating system these potential cost and delay could harm our business our competitive position and result of operation could be harmed if we do not compete effectively the market for our product and service are characterized by intense competition new industry standard evolving distribution model limited barrier to entry disruptive technology development short product life cycle customer price sensitivity and frequent product introduction including alternative with limited functionality available at lower cost or free of charge any of these factor could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margin and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross sell rate well our ability to attract new customer our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing product and service introduce new product and service in timely and cost effective manner meet changing customer expectation and need extend our core technology into new application and anticipate emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development furthermore some of our competitor and potential competitor enjoy competitive advantage such greater financial technical sale marketing and other resource broader brand awareness and access to larger customer base result of these advantage potential and current customer might select the product and service of our competitor causing loss of our market share in addition consolidation ha occurred among some of our competitor further consolidation in these market may subject to increased competitive pressure and may harm our result of operation for additional information regarding our competition and the risk arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled competition contained in part item of this report introduction of new technology could harm our business and result of operation the expectation and need of technology consumer are constantly evolving our future success depends on variety of factor including our continued ability to innovate introduce new product and service efficiently enhance and integrate our product and service in timely and cost effective manner extend our core technology into new application and anticipate emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development integration of our product and service with one another and other company offering creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third party if any disruptive technology or competing product service or operating system that are not compatible with our solution achieve widespread acceptance our operating result could suffer and our business could be harmed the introduction of certain technology may reduce the effectiveness of our product for example some of our product rely on third party cooky which are placed on individual browser when consumer visit website that contain advertisement we use these cooky to help our customer more effectively advertise gauge the performance of their advertisement and detect and prevent fraudulent activity consumer can block or delete cooky through their browser or ad blocking software or application the most common internet browser allow consumer to modify their browser setting to prevent cooky from accepted by their browser or are set to block third party cooky by default increased use of method software or application that block cooky could harm our business of contentssome of our enterprise offering have extended and complex sale cycle which can make our sale cycle unpredictable sale cycle for some of our enterprise offering including our adobe experience cloud solution and etlas in our digital medium business are multi phased and complex the complexity in these sale cycle is due to several factor including the need for our sale representative to educate customer about the use and benefit of large scale deployment of our product and service including technical capability security feature potential cost saving and return on investment the desire of organization to undertake significant evaluation process to determine their technology requirement prior to making information technology expenditure the need for our representative to spend significant amount of time assisting potential customer in their testing and evaluation of our product and service intensifying competition within the industry the negotiation of large complex enterprise wide contract the need for our customer to obtain requisition approval from various decision maker within their organization due to the complexity of our solution touching multiple department within customer organization and customer budget constraint economic condition and unplanned administrative delay we spend substantial time and expense on our sale effort without assurance that potential customer will ultimately purchase our solution we target our sale effort at larger enterprise customer these trend are expected to continue and could have greater impact on our result of operation additionally our enterprise sale pattern ha historically been uneven where higher percentage of quarter total sale occur during the final week of each quarter which is common in our industry our extended sale cycle for these product and service make it difficult to predict when given sale cycle will close subscription offering could create risk related to the timing of revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue from subscription offering ratably over the term of their subscription agreement which range from to month result most of the subscription revenue we report in each quarter is the result of subscription agreement entered into during previous quarter any reduction in new or renewed subscription in quarter may not be reflected in our revenue result until later quarter decline in new or renewed subscription may decrease our revenue in future quarter lower sale reduced demand for our product and service and increase in our attrition rate may not be fully reflected in our result of operation until future period our subscription model could also make it difficult for to rapidly increase our revenue from subscription based or hosted service through additional sale in any period revenue from new customer will be recognized over the applicable subscription term additionally in connection with our sale effort to enterprise customer and our use of etlas number of factor could affect our revenue including longer than expected sale and implementation cycle potential deferral of revenue due to multiple element revenue arrangement and alternative licensing arrangement if any of our assumption about revenue from our subscription based offering prove incorrect our actual result may vary materially from those anticipated if our customer fail to renew subscription in accordance with our expectation our future revenue and operating result could suffer our adobe experience cloud creative cloud and document cloud offering typically involve subscription based offering pursuant to product and service agreement revenue from our subscription customer is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreement which typically range from to month our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and customer may not renew their subscription at the same or higher level of service for the same number of seat or for the same duration of time if at all moreover under certain circumstance some of our customer have the right to cancel their agreement prior to the expiration of the term our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of our subscription based agreement complicates our ability to precisely forecast renewal rate therefore we can not provide assurance that we will be able to accurately predict future customer renewal rate of contentsour customer renewal rate may decline or fluctuate result of number of factor including their level of satisfaction with our service our ability to continue enhancing feature and functionality the reliability including uptime of our subscription offering the price of offering and those offered by our competitor the actual or perceived information security of our system and service decrease in the size of our customer base reduction in our customer spending level or decline in customer activity result of economic downturn or uncertainty in financial market if our customer do not renew their subscription or if they renew on term le favorable to our revenue may decline security breach in data center we manage or third party manage on our behalf may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of employee and customer data which could expose to liability and adversely affect our reputation and business we process and store significant amount of employee and customer data most of which is hosted by third party service provider security incident impacting our own data center or those controlled by our service provider may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of this data unauthorized access to or disclosure of data stored by adobe or our service provider may occur through break in breach of secure network by an unauthorized party employee theft or misuse or other misconduct it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security control by customer or employee account created with weak or recycled password could allow cyber attacker to gain access to customer data additionally failure by customer to remove account of their own employee or the granting of account by the customer in an uncontrolled manner may allow for access by former or unauthorized customer representative if there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer information or if third party were to gain unauthorized access to the information we posse on behalf of our customer our operation could be disrupted our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claim or other liability regulatory investigation or fine in addition such perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of the information we collect or breach of our security could damage our reputation result in the loss of customer and harm our business we rely on data center managed both by adobe and third party to host and deliver our service well access collect use transmit and store data and any interruption or delay in these hosted service or failure in data collection or transmission could expose to liability and harm our business and reputation much of our business relies on hardware and service that are hosted managed and controlled directly by adobe or third party service provider including our online store at adobe com creative cloud document cloud and experience cloud solution we do not have redundancy for all of our system many of our critical application reside in only one of our data center and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventuality if our business relationship with third party provider of hosting or content delivery service is negatively affected or if one of our content delivery supplier were to terminate it agreement with we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offering to our customer which could subject to reputational harm costly and time intensive notification requirement and cause to lose customer and future business occasionally we migrate data among data center and to third party hosted environment if transition among data center or to third party service provider encounter unexpected interruption unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruption despite precaution undertaken during the process this may impair our delivery of product and service to customer and result in increased cost and liability which may harm our operating result and our business it is also possible that hardware or software failure or error in our system or those of our third party service provider could result in data loss or corruption cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracy that our customer regard significant or cause to fail to meet committed service level or comply with regulatory notification requirement furthermore our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by number of factor including access to the internet the failure of our network or software system security breach or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer website in addition computer virus worm or other malware may harm our system causing to lose data and the transmission of computer virus or other malware could expose to litigation or regulatory investigation and costly and time intensive notification requirement we may also find on occasion that we can not deliver data and report to our customer in near real time of number of factor including significant spike in customer activity on their website or failure of our network or software if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the need of our customer base and we experience rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data center or those of third party service outage could occur and our customer could suffer impaired performance of our service such strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject to regulatory notification requirement violation of service level agreement commitment financial liability result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruption in our ability to capture store and supply information in near real time or at all our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customer or we could be found liable for damage or incur other loss of contentsincreasing regulatory focus on privacy issue and expanding law could impact our business model and expose to increased liability privacy and data security law apply to our various business we also do business globally in country that have more stringent data protection law than those in the united state that may be inconsistent across jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and differing interpretation government privacy advocate and class action attorney are increasingly scrutinizing how company collect process use store share and transmit personal data globally new law such the general data protection regulation gdpr in europe and industry self regulatory code have been enacted and more are being considered that may affect our ability and our enterprise customer ability to reach current and prospective customer to respond to both enterprise and individual customer request under the law such individual right of access correction and deletion of their personal information and to implement our business model effectively these new law may also impact our innovation and business driver in developing new and emerging technology artificial intelligence and machine learning these requirement among others may impact demand for our offering and force to bear the burden of more onerous obligation in our contract any perception of our practice product or service violation of individual privacy right may subject to public criticism class action lawsuit reputational harm or investigation or claim by regulator industry group or other third party all of which could disrupt our business and expose to increased liability additionally we store information on behalf of our customer and if our customer fail to comply with contractual obligation or applicable law it could result in litigation or reputational harm to transferring personal information across international border is becoming increasingly complex for example european data transfer outside the european economic area are highly regulated the mechanism that we and many other company rely upon for european data transfer privacy shield and model clause are being contested in the european court system we are closely monitoring development related to requirement for transferring personal data outside the eu these requirement may result in an increase in the obligation required to provide our service in the eu or in sanction and fine for non compliance several other country including australia and japan have also established specific legal requirement for cross border transfer of personal information these development in europe and elsewhere could harm our business financial condition and result of operation security vulnerability in our product and system could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claim maintaining the security of our product computer and network is critical issue for and our customer security researcher criminal hacker and other third party regularly develop new technique to penetrate computer and network security measure and we have previously disclosed certain party have in the past managed to breach our data security system and misused some of our system and software in order to access our end user authentication and payment information in addition cyber attacker also develop and deploy virus worm credential stuffing attack tool and other malicious software program some of which may be specifically designed to attack our product system computer or network sophisticated hardware and operating system application that we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture including bug and other problem that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair customer ability to operate or use our product the cost to prevent eliminate notify affected party of or alleviate cyber or other security problem bug virus worm malicious software program and security vulnerability are significant and our effort to address these problem may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer it is impossible to predict the extent frequency or impact these problem may have on outside party have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employee or user of our product or service to disclose sensitive information via illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactic unauthorized party may also attempt to gain physical access to our facility in order to infiltrate our information system or attempt to gain logical access to our product service or information system for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data these actual and potential breach of our security measure and the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal or confidential data about our employee our customer or their end user including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data result of hacking fraud trickery or other form of deception could expose our employee our customer or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information this may result in litigation and liability or fine our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirement governmental inquiry or oversight or loss of customer confidence any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customer and thereby requiring time and resource to repair our brand and reputation these risk will likely increase we expand our hosted offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information these problem affect our product and service in particular because cyber attacker tend to focus their effort on popular offering with large user base and we expect them to continue to do so critical vulnerability may be identified in some of our application these vulnerability could cause such application to crash and could allow an attacker to take control of the affected system which could result in liability to or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our product and service to customer we devote significant resource to address security vulnerability through engineering more secure product enhancing of contentssecurity and reliability feature in our product and system code hardening conducting rigorous penetration test deploying update to address security vulnerability and improving our incident response time but these security vulnerability can not be totally eliminated the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin and we may be unable to implement these measure quickly enough to prevent cyber attacker from gaining unauthorized access into our system and product despite our preventative effort actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and system may harm our reputation or lead to claim and have in the past led to such claim and could lead some customer to stop using certain product or service to reduce or delay future purchase of product or service or to use competing product or service if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology system or if our system become out of date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customer require our business could be adversely affected customer may also adopt security measure designed to protect their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of new technology further if we or our customer

criterion for revenue recognition ha been met recently adopted accounting guidance on march the financial accounting standard board fasb issued accounting standard update asu no improvement to employee share based payment accounting which simplifies various aspect related to the accounting and presentation of share based payment the amendment require entity to record all tax effect related to share based payment at settlement or expiration through the income statement and the windfall tax benefit to be recorded when it arises subject to normal valuation allowance consideration tax related cash flow resulting from share based payment are required to be reported operating activity in the statement of cash flow the update relating to the income tax effect of the share based payment including the cash flow presentation must be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively further the amendment allow the entity to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeiture or recognize forfeiture they occur if an election is made the change to recognize forfeiture they occur must be adopted using modified retrospective approach with cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings the effective date of the new standard for public company is for fiscal year beginning after december and interim period within those fiscal year early adoption is permitted we early adopted this standard during the first quarter of fiscal required by the standard excess tax benefit recognized on stock based compensation expense were reflected in our consolidated statement of income component of the provision for income tax rather than paid in capital on prospective basis accordingly we recorded excess tax benefit within our provision for income tax rather than additional paid in capital upon adoption the cumulative effect to retained earnings from previously unrecognized excess tax benefit after offset by the related valuation allowance wa not significant to our consolidated balance sheet we also elected to prospectively apply the change in presentation of excess tax benefit wherein excess tax benefit recognized on stock based compensation expense were classified operating activity in our consolidated statement of cash flow for fiscal prior period classification of cash flow related to excess tax benefit were not adjusted in our consolidated statement of cash flow presentation requirement for cash flow related to employee tax paid for withheld share had no impact to all period presented such cash flow have historically

system incorporated note to consolidated financial statement continued there have been no other new accounting pronouncement made effective during fiscal that have significance or potential significance to our consolidated financial statement recent accounting pronouncement not yet effectiveon may the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised good or service to customer the updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in gaap when it becomes effective and permit the use of either the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method in august the fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer deferral of the effective date which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for period beginning after december to december with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date accordingly the updated standard is effective for in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to adopt this updated standard in the first quarter of fiscal on modified retrospective basis we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure while we are continuing to ass all potential impact of the new standard we currently believe that the most significant impact relates to our accounting for arrangement that include on premise term based software license bundled with maintenance and support under current gaap the revenue attributable to these software license is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement because vsoe doe not exist for the undelivered maintenance and support element it is not sold separately the requirement to have vsoe for undelivered element to enable the separation of revenue for the delivered software license is eliminated under the new standard accordingly under the new standard we will be required to recognize revenue portion of the arrangement fee upon delivery of the software license we expect revenue related to our professional service and cloud offering including creative cloud and document cloud for business enterprise individual and team to remain substantially unchanged when sold with cloud enabled service creative cloud and document cloud require significant level of integration and interdependency with software and the individual component are not considered distinct revenue for these offering will continue to be recognized over the period in which the cloud service are provided under current gaap we expense cost related to the acquisition of revenue generating contract incurred under the new standard we will be required to capitalize certain cost incremental to contract acquisition and amortize them over the expected period of benefit due to the complexity of certain of our contract the actual accounting treatment required under the new standard for these arrangement may be dependent on contract specific term and therefore may vary in some instance on february the fasb issued asu no lease requiring lessee to recognize right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all lease with the exception of short term lease with lease term of twelve month or le for lessee lease will continue to be classified either operating or finance lease in the income statement lessor accounting is similar to the current model but updated to align with certain change to the lessee model lessor will continue

fiscal year early adoption is permitted the new standard must be adopted using modified retrospective transition and requires application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest

standard will have on our consolidated financial statement and related disclosure on august the fasb issued asu no derivative and hedging requiring expanded hedge accounting for both non financial and financial risk component and refining the measurement of hedge result to better reflect an entity hedging strategy the updated standard also amends the presentation and disclosure requirement and
