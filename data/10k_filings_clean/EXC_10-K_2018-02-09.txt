of contentsitem risk factorseach of the registrant operates in market and regulatory environment that pose significant risk many of which are beyond that registrant control management of each registrant regularly meet with the chief risk officer and the registrant risk management committee rmc which comprises officer of the registrant to identify and evaluate the most significant risk of the registrant business and the appropriate step to manage and mitigate those risk the chief risk officer and senior executive of the registrant discus those risk with the finance and risk committee and audit committee of the exelon board of director and the comed peco bge and phi board of director in addition the generation oversight committee of the exelon board of director evaluates risk related to the generation business the risk factor discussed below could adversely affect one or more of the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position and the market price of their publicly traded security each of the registrant ha disclosed the known material risk that affect it business at this time however there may be further risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by registrant to be material that could adversely affect it performance or financial condition in the future exelon result of operation cash flow and financial position are affected to significant degree by generation position predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy market with concentration in select region and the role of the utility registrant operator of electric transmission and distribution system in six of the largest metropolitan area in the united state factor that affect the result of operation cash flow or financial position of the registrant fall primarily under the following category all of which are discussed in further detail below market and financial factor exelon and generation result of operation are affected by price fluctuation in the energy market power price are function of supply and demand which in turn are driven by factor such the price of fuel in particular the price of natural gas which affect the price that generation can obtain for the output of it power plant the presence of other generation resource in the market in which generation output is sold the demand for electricity in the market where the registrant conduct their business the impact of on going competition in the retail channel and emerging technology regulatory and legislative factor the regulatory and legislative factor that affect the registrant include change to the law and regulation that govern competitive market and utility cost recovery tax policy zero emission credit program and environmental policy in particular exelon and generation financial performance could be affected by change in the design of competitive wholesale power market or generation ability to sell power in those market in addition potential regulation and legislation including regulation or legislation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standard rps could have significant effect on the registrant also return for the utility registrant are influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceeding operational factor the registrant operational performance is subject to those factor inherent in running the nation largest fleet of nuclear power reactor and large electric and gas distribution system the safe secure and effective operation of the nuclear facility and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligation well the ability to maintain the availability reliability safety and security of it energy delivery system are fundamental to exelon ability to achieve value added growth for customer community and shareholder additionally the operating cost of the registrant and the opinion of their customer regulator and shareholder are affected by those company ability to maintain the reliability safety and efficiency of their energy delivery system of content risk related to the phi merger exelon is subject to additional risk related to the merger with phi which closed on march discussion of each of these risk category and other risk factor is included below market and financial factorsgeneration is exposed to depressed price in the wholesale and retail power market which could negatively affect it result of operation cash flow or financial position exelon and generation generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of it electricity generation supply portfolio generation earnings and cash flow are therefore exposed to variability of spot and forward market price in the market in which it operates price of fuelsthe spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour thus the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit often the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating station fueled by fossil fuel consequently change in the market price of fossil fuel often result in comparable change to the market price of power for example the use of technology to recover natural gas from shale deposit ha increased natural gas supply and reserve placing downward pressure on natural gas price and therefore on power price the continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resource such wind and solar whether mandated through rps or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation could displace higher marginal cost plant further reducing power price in addition further delay or elimination of epa air quality regulation could prolong the duration for which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market price demand and supplythe market price for electricity is also affected by change in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity unfavorable economic condition milder than normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response program could each depress demand the result is that higher cost generating resource do not run frequently putting downward pressure on electricity market price the tepid economic environment in recent year and growing energy efficiency and demand response initiative have limited the demand for electricity in generation market in addition in some market the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation when combined with other base load generation such nuclear could often exceed demand during some hour of the day resulting in loss of revenue for base load generating plant such exelon nuclear plant increased supply in excess of demand is furthered by the continuation of rps mandate and subsidy for renewable energy retail competitiongeneration retail operation compete for customer in competitive environment which affect the margin that generation can earn and the volume that it is able to serve in period of sustained low natural gas and power price and low market volatility retail competitor can aggressively pursue market share because the barrier to entry can be low and wholesale generator including generation use their retail operation to hedge generation output increased or more aggressive competition could adversely affect overall gross margin and profitability in generation retail operation sustained low market price or depressed demand and over supply could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position and such impact could be of contentsemphasized given generation concentration of base load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market region namely the midwest and the mid atlantic these impact could adversely affect exelon and generation ability to fund regulated utility growth for the benefit of customer reduce debt and provide attractive shareholder return in addition such condition may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facility which could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation through accelerated depreciation expense impairment charge related to inventory that can not be used at other nuclear unit and cancellation of in flight capital project accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel cost severance cost accelerated asset retirement obligation expense related to future decommissioning activity and additional funding of decommissioning cost which can be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expense slow recovery in market condition could result in prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity price including low forward natural gas and power price and low market volatility which could also adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position see note early nuclear plant retirement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information in addition to price fluctuation generation is exposed to other risk in the power market that are beyond it control and could negatively affect it result of operation exelon and generation credit riskin the bilateral market generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from generation will not perform under their obligation for operational or financial reason in the event the counterparties to these arrangement fail to perform generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale market at le favorable price and incur additional loss to the extent of amount if any already paid to the counterparties in the spot market generation is exposed to risk result of default sharing mechanism that exist within certain market primarily rtos and isos the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participant generation is also party to agreement with entity in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrade or other financial difficulty in addition generation retail sale subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activity to serve commercial and industrial company governmental entity and residential customer retail credit risk result when customer default on their contractual obligation this risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer account balance well the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer market designsthe wholesale market vary from region to region with distinct rule practice and procedure change in these market rule problem with rule implementation or failure of any of these market could adversely affect generation business in addition significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have detrimental effect on market stability the registrant are potentially affected by emerging technology that could over time affect or transform the energy industry including technology related to energy generation distribution and consumption all registrant some of these technology include but are not limited to further development or application of technology related to shale gas production cost effective renewable energy technology energy efficiency distributed generation and energy storage device such development could affect the price of energy level of customer owned generation customer expectation and current business model and make portion of our electric system power supply and transmission and or distribution facility of contentsobsolete prior to the end of their useful life such technology could also result in further decline in commodity price or demand for delivered energy each of these factor could materially affect the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position through among other thing reduced operating revenue increased operating and maintenance expense and increased capital expenditure well potential asset impairment charge or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expense over shortened remaining asset useful life market performance and other factor could decrease the value of ndt fund and employee benefit plan asset and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligation which could require significant additional funding all registrant disruption in the capital market and their actual or perceived effect on particular business and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investment held within generation ndts and exelon employee benefit plan trust the registrant have significant obligation in these area and exelon and generation hold substantial asset in these trust to meet those obligation the asset value are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which could fall below the registrant projected return rate decline in the market value of the ndt fund investment could increase generation funding requirement to decommission it nuclear plant decline in the market value of the pension and opeb plan asset will increase the funding requirement associated with exelon pension and opeb plan obligation additionally exelon pension and opeb plan liability are sensitive to change in interest rate interest rate decrease the liability increase potentially increasing benefit cost and funding requirement change in demographic including increased number of retirement or change in life expectancy assumption or change to social security or medicare eligibility requirement could also increase the cost and funding requirement of the obligation related to the pension and opeb plan if future increase in pension and other postretirement cost result of reduced plan asset or other factor can not be recovered or can not be recovered in timely manner from the utility registrant customer the result of operation cash flow or financial position of the utility registrant could be negatively affected ultimately if the registrant are unable to manage the investment within the ndt fund and benefit plan asset and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liability their result of operation cash flow or financial position could be negatively impacted unstable capital and credit market and increased volatility in commodity market could adversely affect the registrant business in several way including the availability and cost of short term fund for liquidity requirement the registrant ability to meet long term commitment generation ability to hedge effectively it generation portfolio and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy market each could negatively impact the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position all registrant the registrant rely on the capital market particularly for publicly offered debt well the banking and commercial paper market to meet their financial commitment and short term liquidity need if internal fund are not available from the registrant respective operation disruption in the capital and credit market in the united state or abroad could adversely affect the registrant ability to access the capital market or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facility the registrant access to fund under their credit facility depends on the ability of the bank that are party to the facility to meet their funding commitment those bank may not be able to meet their funding commitment to the registrant if they experience shortage of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volume of borrowing request from the registrant and other borrower within short period of time the inability to access capital market or credit facility and longer term disruption in the capital and credit market result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternative or failure of significant financial institution could result in the deferral of discretionary capital of contentsexpenditures change to generation hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirement or reduction in dividend payment or other discretionary us of cash in addition the registrant have exposure to worldwide financial market including europe canada and asia disruption in these market could reduce or restrict the registrant ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable term of december approximately or billion or billion and or billion of the registrant available credit facility were with european canadian and asian bank respectively the credit facility include billion in aggregate total commitment of which billion wa available of december of december there were no borrowing under generation bilateral credit facility see note debt and credit agreement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the credit facility the strength and depth of competition in energy market depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading party which could be adversely affected by disruption in the capital and credit market and legislative and regulatory initiative that could affect participant in commodity transaction reduced capital and liquidity and failure of significant institution that participate in the energy market could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy market that are important to the respective business of the registrant perceived weakness in the competitive strength of the energy market could lead to pressure for greater regulation of those market or attempt to replace market structure with other mechanism for the sale of power including the requirement of long term contract which could have material adverse effect on exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position if any of the registrant were to experience downgrade in it credit rating to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard in it agreement with it counterparties it would be required to provide significant amount of collateral under it agreement with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing cost all registrant generation business is subject to credit quality standard that could require market participant to post collateral for their obligation if generation were to be downgraded or lose it investment grade credit rating based on it senior unsecured debt rating or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard of trading counterparties it would be required under it hedging arrangement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon it liquidity the amount of collateral required to be provided by generation at any point in time depends on variety of factor including the notional amount of the applicable hedge the nature of counterparty and related agreement and change in power or other commodity price in addition if generation were downgraded it could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade generation could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general or generation in particular ha deteriorated change in rating methodology by the credit rating agency could also have negative impact on the rating of generation generation ha project specific financing arrangement and must meet the requirement of various agreement relating to those financing failure to meet those arrangement could give rise to project specific financing default which if not cured or waived could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated and if such repayment were not made the lender or security holder would generally have broad remedy including right to foreclose against the project asset and related collateral or to force the exelon subsidiary in the project specific financing to enter into bankruptcy proceeding the utility registrant operating agreement with pjm and peco bge and dpl natural gas procurement contract contain collateral provision that are affected by their credit rating and market of contentsprices if certain wholesale market condition were to exist and the utility registrant were to lose their investment grade credit rating based on their senior unsecured debt rating they would be required to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon their remaining source of liquidity pjm collateral posting requirement will generally increase market price rise and decrease market price fall collateral posting requirement for peco bge and dpl with respect to their natural gas supply contract will generally increase forward market price fall and decrease forward market price rise given the relationship to forward market price contract collateral requirement can be volatile in addition if the utility registrant were downgraded they could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade utility registrant could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general or utility registrant in particular ha deteriorated utility registrant could experience downgrade if it current regulatory environment becomes le predictable by materially lowering return for the utility registrant or adopting other measure to limit utility rate additionally the rating for utility registrant could be downgraded if it financial result are weakened from current level due to weaker operating performance or due to failure to properly manage it capital structure in addition change in rating methodology by the agency could also have negative impact on the rating of the utility registrant the utility registrant conduct their respective business and operate under governance model and other arrangement and procedure intended to assure that the utility registrant are treated separate independent company distinct from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in order to isolate the utility registrant from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in the event of financial difficulty at exelon or another exelon subsidiary these measure commonly referred to ring fencing could help avoid or limit downgrade in the credit rating of the utility registrant in the event of reduction in the credit rating of exelon despite these ring fencing measure the credit rating of the utility registrant could remain linked to some degree to the credit rating of exelon consequently reduction in the credit rating of exelon could result in reduction of the credit rating of some or all of the utility registrant reduction in the credit rating of utility registrant could have material adverse effect on the utility registrant see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation liquidity and capital resource credit matter market condition and security rating for further information regarding the potential impact of credit downgrade on the registrant cash flow generation financial performance could be negatively affected by price volatility availability and other risk factor associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel exelon and generation generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuel to operate most of it generating facility nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long term uranium supply contract contracted conversion service contracted enrichment service or combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication service natural gas and oil are procured for generating plant through annual short term and spot market purchase the supply market for nuclear fuel natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuation availability restriction and counterparty default that could negatively affect the result of operation cash flow or financial position for generation of contentsgeneration risk management policy can not fully eliminate the risk associated with it commodity trading activity exelon and generation generation asset based power position well it power marketing fuel procurement and other commodity trading activity expose generation to risk of commodity price movement generation buy and sell energy and other product and enters into financial contract to manage risk and hedge various position in generation power generation portfolio generation is exposed to volatility in financial result for unhedged position well the risk of ineffective hedge generation attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limit and risk management procedure these risk limit and risk management procedure may not work planned and can not eliminate all risk associated with these activity even when it policy and procedure are followed and decision are made based on projection and estimate of future performance result of operation could be diminished if the judgment and assumption underlying those decision prove to be incorrect factor such future price and demand for power and other energy related commodity become more difficult to predict and the calculation become le reliable the further into the future estimate are made result generation can not predict the impact that it commodity trading activity and risk management decision could have on it business result of operation cash flow or financial position financial performance and load requirement could be adversely affected if generation is unable to effectively manage it power portfolio exelon and generation significant portion of generation power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contract with the utility registrant and other customer to the extent portion of the power portfolio are not needed for that purpose generation output is sold in the wholesale power market to the extent it power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirement of it customer under the related agreement generation must purchase power in the wholesale power market generation financial result could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost effectively meet the load requirement of it customer manage it power portfolio or effectively address the change in the wholesale power market challenge to tax position taken by the registrant well tax law change and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effect of business decision could impact the registrant result of operation cash flow

price for the utility registrant and the impact of economic downturn could lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balance additionally increased rate could lead to decreased volume delivered both of these factor could decrease generation and the utility registrant result from operation cash flow or financial position all registrant the impact of economic downturn on the utility registrant customer such unemployment for residential customer and le demand for product and service provided by commercial and industrial customer and the related regulatory limitation on residential service termination could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balance which would negatively affect the utility registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position generation customer facing energy delivery activity face similar economic downturn risk such lower volume sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balance which could negatively affect generation result of operation cash flow or financial position see item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further discussion of the registrant credit risk the utility registrant current procurement plan include purchasing power through contracted supplier and in the spot market comed peco and ace cost of purchased power are charged to customer without return or

customer with no return or profit component for bge purchased natural gas cost are charged to customer using mbr mechanism that compare the actual cost of gas to market index the difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholder and customer purchased power and natural gas price fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand significantly higher rate related to purchased power and natural gas could result in decline in customer usage lower revenue and potentially additional uncollectible account expense for the utility registrant in addition any challenge by the regulator or the utility registrant to the recoverability of these cost could have material adverse effect on the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position also the utility registrant cash flow could be adversely affected by difference between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customer the effect of weather could impact the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position all registrant weather condition directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodity temperature above normal level in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenue and temperature below normal level in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenue moderate temperature adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenue at peco dpl and ace due to revenue decoupling of

weather with the exception of major storm pursuant to the future energy job act feja beginning in customer rate for comed are adjusted to eliminate the favorable and unfavorable impact of weather and customer usage pattern on distribution revenue extreme weather condition or damage resulting from storm could stress the utility registrant transmission and distribution system communication system and technology resulting in increased maintenance and capital cost and limiting each company ability to meet peak customer demand these extreme condition could have detrimental effect on the utility registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position first and third quarter financial result in particular are substantially dependent on weather condition and could make period comparison le relevant generation operation are also affected by weather which affect demand for electricity well operating condition to the extent that weather is warmer in the summer or colder in the winter than assumed generation could require greater resource to meet it contractual commitment extreme weather condition or storm could affect the availability of generation and it transmission limiting generation ability to source or send power to where it is sold in addition drought like condition limiting water usage could impact generation ability to run certain generating asset at full capacity these condition which can not be accurately predicted could have an adverse effect by causing generation to seek additional capacity at time when wholesale market are tight or to seek to sell excess capacity at time when market are weak certain long lived asset and other asset recorded on the registrant statement of financial position could become impaired which would result in write offs of the impaired amount all registrant long lived asset represent the single largest asset class on the registrant statement of financial position specifically long lived asset account for and of total asset

generation could sell their output thereby increasing the revenue generation could realize from it low carbon nuclear asset conversely existing or new regulation intended to reduce ghg emission could be rolled back allowing fossil fueled facility which were otherwise scheduled to retire to continue to operate if economical this could result in decrease in market price thereby reducing generation revenue however national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an rps could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facility in the midwest which could put downward pressure on wholesale market price for electricity from generation midwest nuclear asset partially offsetting any additional value exelon and generation might derive from generation nuclear asset under carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future similarly final regulation under section of the clean air act may not provide sufficient incentive for state to utilize carbon free nuclear power mean of meeting ghg reduction requirement while continuing policy of favoring renewable energy source current state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentive for regional wind development the registrant can not predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposal could become law or what their effect will be on the registrant of contentslegislative and regulatory effort in illinois and new york to preserve the environmental attribute and reliability benefit of zero emission nuclear powered generating facility through zero emission credit program are subject to legal challenge and if overturned could negatively impact exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position and result in the early retirement of certain of generation nuclear plant generation could be negatively affected by possible federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale market exelon and generation federal and state legislative and regulatory body are facing pressure to address consumer concern or are raising concern that energy price in wholesale market are high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working and therefore are considering some form of regulation or some other mean of reducing wholesale market price or subsidizing new generation generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy market to achieve it business objective approximately of generation generating resource which include directly owned asset and capacity obtained through long term contract are located in the area encompassed by pjm generation future result of operation will depend on ferc continued adherence to and support for policy that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power market and recognize the value of zero carbon electricity and resiliency and the absence of material change to market structure that would limit or otherwise negatively affect market competition generation could also be adversely affected by state law regulation or initiative designed to reduce wholesale price artificially below competitive level or to subsidize existing or new generation ferc requirement for market based rate authority established in order and and related subsequent order could pose risk that generation may no longer satisfy ferc test for market based rate since order became final in june generation ha obtained order affirming generation authority to sell at market based rate and none denying that authority the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act wa enacted in july the part of the act that affect exelon most significantly is title vii which is known the dodd frank wall street transparency and accountability act dodd frank dodd frank requires new regulatory regime for over the counter swap swap including mandatory clearing for certain category of swap incentive to shift swap activity to exchange trading margin and capital requirement and other obligation designed to promote transparency the primary aim of dodd frank is to regulate the key intermediary in the swap market which entity are swap dealer sd major swap participant msps or certain other financial entity but the law also applies to lesser degree to end user of swap the cftc dodd frank regulation generally preserved the ability of end user in the energy industry to hedge their risk using swap without being subject to mandatory clearing and many of the other substantive regulation that apply to sd msps and other financial entity generation manages and expects to be able to continue to manage it commercial activity to ensure that it doe not have to register an sd or msp or other type of covered financial entity there are some rulemaking proceeding that have not yet been finalized in particular proposed rule on position limit that would apply to both exchange traded future contract and economically equivalent over the counter swap it is possible that those rule will be finalized by the end of although the company would incur some cost associated with monitoring and compliance with such rule it doe not expect the rule to have material impact on it business operation the utility registrant could also be subject to some dodd frank requirement to the extent they were to enter into swap however at this time management of the utility registrant continue to expect that their company will not be materially affected by dodd frank of contentsgeneration affiliation with the utility registrant together with the presence of substantial percentage of generation physical asset base within the utility registrant service territory could increase generation cost of doing business to the extent future complaint or challenge regarding the utility registrant retail rate result in settlement or legislative or regulatory requirement funded in part by generation exelon and generation generation ha significant generating resource within the service area of the utility registrant and make significant sale to each of them those fact tend to cause generation to be directly affected by development in those market government official legislator and advocacy group are aware of generation affiliation with the utility registrant and it sale to each of them in period of rising utility rate particularly when driven by increased cost of energy production and supply those official and advocacy group could question or challenge cost and transaction incurred by the utility registrant with generation irrespective of any previous regulatory process or approval underlying those transaction these challenge could increase the time complexity and cost of the associated regulatory proceeding and the occurrence of such challenge could subject generation to level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitor in those market in addition government official and legislator could seek way to force generation to contribute to effort to mitigate potential or actual rate increase through measure such generation based tax and contribution to rate relief package the registrant could incur substantial cost to fulfill their obligation related to environmental and other matter all registrant the business which the registrant operate are subject to extensive environmental regulation and legislation by local state and federal authority these law and regulation affect the manner in which the registrant conduct

nuclear capacity factorscapacity factor for generating unit particularly capacity factor for nuclear generating unit significantly affect generation result of operation nuclear plant operation involve substantial fixed operating cost but produce electricity at low variable cost due to nuclear fuel cost typically being lower than fossil fuel cost consequently to be successful generation must consistently operate it nuclear facility at high capacity factor lower capacity factor increase generation operating cost by requiring generation to produce additional energy from primarily it fossil facility or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward market in order to satisfy generation obligation to committed third party sale including the utility registrant these source generally have higher cost than generation incurs to produce energy from it nuclear station nuclear refueling outagesin general refueling outage are planned to occur every to month the total number of refueling outage along with their duration could have significant impact on generation result of operation when refueling outage last longer than anticipated or generation experience unplanned outage capacity factor decrease and generation face lower margin due to higher energy replacement cost and or lower energy sale and higher operating and maintenance cost nuclear fuel qualitythe quality of nuclear

and or increased cost due to decreased generation capability of contentsoperational riskoperations at any of generation nuclear generation plant could degrade to the point where generation ha to shut the plant or operate at le than full capacity if this were to happen identifying and correcting the cause could require significant time and expense generation could choose to close plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity in either event generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment for plant operated but not wholly owned by generation generation could also incur liability to the co owner for nuclear plant not operated and not wholly owned by generation from which generation receives portion of the plant output generation result of operation are dependent on the operational performance of the operator and could be adversely affected by significant event at those plant additionally poor operating performance at nuclear plant not owned by generation could result in increased regulation and reduced public support for nuclear fueled energy which could significantly affect generation result of operation cash flow or financial position in addition closure of generating plant owned by others or extended interruption of generating plant or failure of transmission line could affect transmission system that could adversely affect the sale and delivery of electricity in market served by generation nuclear major incident riskalthough the safety record of nuclear

substantially exceed such liability fact circumstance or our estimate may change including change in the approach and timing of decommissioning activity change in decommissioning cost change in federal or state regulatory requirement on the decommissioning of such facility other change in our estimate or generation ability to effectively execute on it planned decommissioning activity the performance of capital market could significantly affect the value of the trust fund currently generation is making contribution to certain trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount being collected by peco from it customer and remitted to generation while generation through peco ha recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer subject to certain limitation and threshold it ha no recourse to collect additional amount from utility customer for any of it other nuclear unit if there is shortfall of fund necessary for decommissioning if circumstance changed such that generation would be unable to continue to make contribution to the trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount collected from peco customer or if generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer if there wa shortfall of fund for decommissioning the adequacy of the trust fund related to the former peco unit could be negatively affected and exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position could be significantly affected see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for

pay damage to it customer in some circumstance involving extended outage affecting large number of it customer and those damage could be material to comed result of operation cash flow or financial position the utility registrant respective ability to deliver electricity their operating cost and their capital expenditure could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion and failure of neighboring transmission system exelon and the utility registrant demand for electricity within the utility registrant service area could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effect on operating cost revenue and result of operation also insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize the utility registrant ability to comply with reliability standard and strain customer and regulatory agency relationship with all utility potential concern over transmission capacity or generation facility retirement could result in pjm or ferc requiring the utility registrant to upgrade or expand their respective transmission system through additional capital expenditure the electricity transmission facility of the utility registrant are interconnected with the transmission facility of neighboring utility and are part of the interstate power transmission grid that is operated by pjm rto although pjm system and operation are designed to ensure the reliable operation of the transmission grid and prevent the operation of one utility from an adverse impact on the

could include investment opportunity in renewables development of natural gas generation nuclear advisory or operating service for third of contentsparties distributed generation potential expansion of the existing wholesale gas business and entry into liquefied natural gas such initiative could involve significant risk and uncertainty including distraction of management from current operation inadequate return on capital and unidentified issue not discovered in the diligence performed prior to launching an initiative or entering market these market mature there could be new market entrant or expansion by established competitor that increase competition for customer and resource additionally it is possible that ferc state public utility commission or others could impose certain other

constructed asset once operational borrowing under these agreement are secured by the asset and equity of each respective project the lender do not have recourse against exelon or generation in the event of default if specific project financing entity doe not maintain compliance with it specific debt financing covenant there could be requirement to accelerate repayment of the associated debt or other project related borrowing earlier than the stated maturity date in these instance if such repayment wa not satisfied or restructured the lender or security holder would generally have right to foreclose against the project specific asset and related collateral the potential requirement to satisfy it associated debt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated could lead to

the wake of the january polar vortex that blanketed much of the eastern and midwestern united state it became clear that while major outage event wa narrowly avoided resource in pjm were not providing the level of reliability expected by customer result on december pjm filed at ferc proposal to make significant change to it current capacity market construct the reliability pricing model rpm pjm proposed change generally sought to improve resource performance and reliability largely by limiting the excuse for non performance and by increasing the penalty for performance failure the proposal permit supplier to include in capacity market offer additional cost and risk so they can meet these higher performance requirement while offer are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing

nyiso capacity market include minimum offer price rule mopr that is intended to preclude buyer from exercising buyer market power if resource is subjected to mopr it offer is adjusted to remove the revenue it receives through federal state or other government provided financial support program resulting in higher offer that may not clear the capacity market currently the moprs in pjm and nyiso apply only to certain new resource exelon ha generally opposed policy that require subsidy or give preferential treatment to generation provider or technology that do not provide superior reliability

resource could have on capacity market such the new of contentsjersey lcapp and maryland cfd program however in exelon view moprs should not be applied to resource that receive compensation for providing superior reliability or environmental benefit on january the electric power supply association epsa filed two request with ferc one seeking to amend prior complaint against pjm and another seeking expedited action on pending nyiso compliance filing in an existing proceeding both filing allege that the relevant mopr should be expanded to also apply to existing resource receiving zec compensation under the new york ce and illinois program the epsa party have filed motion to expedite both proceeding exelon ha filed protest at ferc in response to each filing arguing generally that zec payment provide compensation for an environmental attribute that is distinct from the energy and capacity sold in the ferc jurisdictional market and therefore are no different than other renewable support program like the ptc and rps that have generally not been subject to mopr however if successful for generation facility in nyiso and pjm expected to receive zec compensation quad city ginna nine mile point and fitzpatrick an expanded mopr could require exclusion of zec compensation when bidding into future capacity auction such that these facility would have an increased risk of not clearing in those auction and thus no longer receiving capacity revenue during the respective zec program any such mitigation of these generating resource could have material effect on exelon and generation future cash flow and result of operation on august epsa filed motion to lodge the district court decision dismissing the complaint and urging ferc to act expeditiously on it request to expand the mopr on september exelon filed response in each docket noting that it doe not oppose the motion to lodge but arguing that the request to expedite decision on the request to expand the mopr have no merit the timing of ferc decision with respect to both proceeding is currently unknown and the outcome of these matter is currently uncertain doe notice of proposed rulemakingon august the doe

by baseload generation such nuclear plant on september the doe issued notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that would entitle certain eligible resilient generating unit those located in organized market with day supply of fuel on site not already subject to state cost of service regulation and satisfying certain other requirement to recover fully allocated cost and earn fair return on equity on their

terminating the rulemaking docket that wa initiated to address the proposed rule in the doe nopr concluding the proposed rule did not sufficiently demonstrate there is resiliency issue and that it proposed remedy that did not appear to be just reasonable and nondiscriminatory required under the federal power act at the same time the ferc initiated new proceeding to consider resiliency challenge to the bulk power system and evaluate whether additional ferc action to address resiliency would be appropriate the ferc directed each rto and iso to respond within day to specific question about how

asset may not be recoverable indicator of potential impairment may include deteriorating business climate including decline in energy price condition of the asset an asset remaining idle for more than short period of time specific regulatory disallowance advance in technology or plan to dispose of long lived asset significantly before the end of it useful life among others the review of long lived asset and asset group for impairment utilizes significant assumption about operating strategy and estimate of future cash flow which require assessment of current and projected market condition for the generation business forecasting future cash flow requires assumption regarding forecasted commodity price for the sale of power and purchase of fuel and the expected operation of asset variation in the assumption used could lead to different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and thus could have significant impact on the consolidated financial statement an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flow of the long lived asset or asset group are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for the generation business the lowest level of independent cash flow is determined by the evaluation of several factor including the geographic dispatch of the generation unit and the hedging strategy related to those unit well the associated intangible asset or liability recorded on the balance sheet the cash flow from the generating unit are generally evaluated at regional portfolio level with cash flow generated from the customer supply and risk management activity including cash flow from related intangible asset and liability on the balance sheet in certain case generating asset may be evaluated on an individual basis where those asset are contracted on long term basis with third party and operation are independent of other generating asset typically contracted renewables on quarterly basis generation ass it long lived asset or asset group for indicator of impairment if indicator are present for long lived asset or asset group comparison of the undiscounted expected future cash flow to the carrying value is performed when the undiscounted cash flow analysis indicates the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable the amount of the impairment loss is determined by measuring the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset or asset group over it fair value the fair value of the long lived asset or asset group is dependent upon market participant view of the exit price of the asset this includes significant assumption of the estimated future cash flow generated by the asset and market discount rate of

making additional cash contribution to the ndt fund to ensure sufficient fund are available see note asset retirement obligation of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the nrc minimum funding requirement if nuclear plant were to early retire there is risk that it will no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirement due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activity and shorter time period over which the ndt fund investment could appreciate in value shortfall could require exelon to post parental guarantee for generation share of the

utilize the ndt fund to pay for non radiological decommissioning cost spent fuel management and site restoration cost if unit doe not receive this exemption the cost would be borne by the owner while the ultimate amount may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenario and or reimbursement of certain cost under the united state department of energy reimbursement agreement

is expected to have higher operating cash flow in the range of approximately billion to billion for the period from to reflecting the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate and full expensing of capital investment the tcja is generally expected to result in lower operating cash flow for the utility registrant result of the elimination of bonus depreciation and lower customer rate increased operating cash flow for the utility registrant from lower corporate federal income tax rate is expected to be more than offset over time by lower customer rate resulting from lower income tax expense recovery and the settlement of deferred income tax net regulatory liability established pursuant to the tcja the amount and timing of settlement of the net regulatory liability will be determined by the utility registrant respective rate regulator subject to certain irs normalization rule the table below set forth the registrant estimated categorization of their net regulatory liability of december the amount in the table below are shown on an after tax basis reflecting future net cash outflow after taking into consideration the income tax benefit associated with the ultimate settlement with customer successor exelon comed peco bge phi pepco dpl acesubject to irs normalization rule to rate regulator regulatory liability given the regulatory treatment of income tax benefit related to electric and gas distribution repair peco remains in an overall net regulatory asset position of december after recording the impact related to the tcja result the amount of customer benefit resulting from the tcja subject to the discretion of peco rate regulator are lower relative to the other utility registrant refer to note regulatory matter for additional information net regulatory liability amount subject to normalization rule generally may not be passed back to customer any faster than over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset giving rise to the associated deferred income tax such deferred income tax generally relate to property plant and equipment with remaining useful life ranging from to year across the utility registrant for the remaining amount rate regulator could require the passing back of amount to customer over shorter time frame which could materially decrease operating cash outflow at each of the utility registrant in the near term the utility registrant expect to fund any such required incremental operating cash outflow using combination of third party debt financing and equity funding from exelon in combination generally consistent with existing capitalization ratio structure to fund any additional equity contribution to the utility registrant exelon would have available to it it typical source including but not limited to the increased operating cash flow at generation of contentsreferenced above which over time are expected to exceed the incremental equity need at the utility registrant the utility registrant continue to work with their state regulatory commission to determine the amount and timing of the passing back of tcja income tax saving benefit to customer with filing either made or expected to be made at pepco dpl and ace and approved filing at comed and bge the amount being passed back or proposed to be passed back to customer reflect the benefit of lower income tax expense

question adopted january change the criterion for recognizing revenue from contract with customer the new revenue recognition guidance including subsequent amendment is effective for annual reporting period beginning on or after december with the option to early adopt the standard for annual period beginning on or after december the registrant did not early adopt this standard the new standard replaces existing guidance on revenue recognition including most industry specific guidance with five step model for recognizing and measuring revenue from contract with customer the objective of the new standard is to provide single comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contract with customer to improve comparability within industry across industry and across capital market the underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of good or service to customer at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those good or service the guidance also requires number of disclosure regarding the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and the related cash flow the guidance can be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented full retrospective method or retrospectively with cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of initial adoption modified retrospective method the registrant will apply the new guidance using the full retrospective method which will not have material impact on previously issued financial statement in coordination with the aicpa power and utility industry task force the registrant reached conclusion on the following key accounting issue the utility registrant tariff sale contract including those with lower credit quality customer are generally deemed to be probable of collection under the guidance and thus the timing of revenue recognition will continue to be concurrent with the delivery of electricity or natural gas consistent with current practice consistent with current industry practice revenue recognized from sale of bundled energy commodity contract involving the delivery of multiple energy commodity such electricity capacity ancillary service etc are generally expected to be recognized upon delivery to the customer in an amount based on the invoice price given that it corresponds directly with the value of the commodity transferred to the customer and contribution in aid of construction are outside of the scope of the standard and therefore will continue to be accounted for reduction to property plant and equipment in assessing the impact of the new revenue guidance the registrant identified the following item that will be accounted for differently cost to acquire certain contract sale commission associated with retail power contract will be deferred and amortized ratably over the term of the contract rather than being expensed incurred of contentscombined note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted variable consideration within certain contract performance bonus will be estimated and recognized revenue over the term of the contract rather than being recognized when realized based on an assessment of existing contract and revenue stream the new guidance including the identified change above will not have material impact on the amount and timing of the registrant revenue recognition one of the new disclosure requirement is to present disaggregated revenue into category that show how economic factor affect the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow in order to comply with this new disclosure requirement generation will disclose disaggregated revenue by operating segment and provide further differentiation by major product electric power and gas and the utility registrant will disclose disaggregated revenue by major customer class residential and commercial and industrial separately for electric and gas in the combined note to consolidated financial statement in addition pursuant to the requirement of the new standard exelon and the utility registrant will present alternative revenue program revenue separately from revenue from contract with customer on the face of their consolidated statement of operation and comprehensive income recognition and measurement of financial asset and financial liability issued january adopted january eliminates the available for sale and cost method classification for equity security and requires that all equity investment other than those accounted for using the equity method of accounting be measured and recorded at fair value with any change in fair value recorded through earnings and for equity investment without readily determinable fair value provides measurement alternative of cost le impairment plus or minus adjustment for observable price change in identical or similar asset in addition equity investment without readily determinable fair value must be qualitatively assessed for impairment each reporting period and fair value determined if any significant impairment indicator exist if fair value is le than carrying value the impairment is recorded through net income immediately in the period in which it is identified the guidance doe not impact the classification or measurement of investment in debt security the guidance also amends several disclosure requirement including requiring financial asset and financial liability to be presented separately in the balance sheet or note grouped by measurement category and form ii disclosure of the method and significant assumption used to estimate fair value or description of the change in the method and assumption used to estimate fair value and iii for financial asset and liability measured at amortized cost disclosure of the fair value of the amount that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability the guidance is effective january and must be applied using modified retrospective transition approach with cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings for initial application of the guidance at the date of adoption the registrant recorded an insignificant adjustment to opening retained earnings of january related to unrealized gain loss on available for sale equity security statement of cash flow classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment issued august adopted january and restricted cash issued november adopted january in

financial statement continued dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted cash flow activity the new standard are effective on january and must be applied on full retrospective basis adoption of the second standard will result in change in presentation of restricted cash on the face of the statement of cash flow otherwise this guidance will not have significant impact on the registrant consolidated statement of cash flow and disclosure intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory issued october adopted january requires entity to recognize the income tax consequence of an intra entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs current gaap prohibits the recognition of current and deferred income tax for an intra entity asset transfer until the asset ha been sold to an outside party the standard is effective january with early adoption permitted the guidance requires modified retrospective transition approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the beginning of the period of adoption clarifying the definition of business issued january adopted january clarifies the definition of business with the objective of addressing whether acquisition or disposition should be accounted for acquisition disposition of asset or acquisition disposition of business if substantially all the fair value of the asset acquired disposed of is concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset the set of transferred asset and activity is not business if the fair value of the asset acquired disposed of is not concentrated in single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable asset then an entity must evaluate whether an input and substantive process exist which together significantly contribute to the ability to produce output the standard also revise the definition of output to focus on good and service to customer the standard will likely result in more acquisition being accounted for asset acquisition the standard is effective january with early adoption permitted and must be applied on prospective basis the registrant did not early adopt the guidance improving

lease issued february increase transparency and comparability among organization by recognizing lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangement the standard is effective january early adoption is permitted however the registrant will not early adopt the standard the issued guidance required modified retrospective transition approach which requires lessee and lessor to recognize and measure lease at the beginning of the earliest period presented january in january the fasb proposed amending the standard to give entity another option for transition the proposed transition method would allow entity to initially apply the requirement of the standard in the period of adoption january the registrant will ass this transition option when the fasb issue the standard the new guidance requires lessee to recognize both the right of use asset and lease liability in the balance sheet for most lease whereas today only finance lease liability referred to capital lease are recognized in the balance sheet in addition the definition of lease ha been revised when an arrangement conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset which may change the classification of an arrangement lease quantitative and qualitative disclosure related to the amount timing and judgment of an entity accounting for lease and the related cash flow are also expanded disclosure requirement apply to both lessee and lessor whereas current disclosure relate only to lessee significant change to lease system process and procedure are required to implement the requirement of the new standard the recognition measurement and presentation of expense and cash flow arising from lease by lessee have not significantly changed from current gaap lessor accounting is also largely unchanged the standard provides number of transition practical expedient that entity may elect these include package of three expedient that must be taken together and allow entity to not reassess whether existing contract contain lease carryforward the existing lease classification and not reassess initial direct cost associated with existing lease in january the fasb issued additional guidance which provides another optional transition practical expedient this practical expedient allows entity to not evaluate land easement under the new guidance at adoption if they were not previously accounted for lease the registrant have assessed the lease standard and are executing detailed implementation plan in preparation for adoption on january key activity in the implementation plan include developing complete lease inventory and abstracting the required data attribute into lease accounting system that support the registrant lease portfolio and integrates with existing system evaluating the transition practical expedient available under the guidance identifying assessing and documenting technical accounting issue policy consideration and financial reporting implication includes completing detailed contract assessment for sample of transaction to determine whether they are lease under the new guidance of

and net investment in lease recognized by lessor under the new guidance on initial recognition and at each reporting period an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity current estimate of credit loss expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument the standard doe not make change to the existing impairment model for non financial asset such fixed asset intangible and goodwill the standard will be effective january with early adoption of january permitted and for most debt instrument requires modified retrospective transition approach through cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings of the beginning of the period of adoption goodwill impairment issued january simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing step of the current test which requires calculation of hypothetical purchase price allocation under the revised guidance goodwill impairment will be measured the amount by which reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill currently step of the two step impairment test entity will continue to have the option to perform qualitative assessment to determine if quantitative impairment test is necessary exelon generation comed phi and dpl have goodwill of december this updated guidance is not currently expected to impact the registrant financial

hedging strategy to be eligible for hedge accounting the amendment are intended to more closely align hedge accounting with company risk management strategy simplify the application of hedge accounting and increase transparency to the scope and result of hedging program there are also amendment related to effectiveness testing and disclosure requirement the guidance is effective january and early adoption is permitted with modified retrospective transition approach the registrant are currently assessing this standard but do not currently expect significant impact given the limited

exelon ha generally opposed policy that require subsidy or give preferential treatment to generation provider or technology that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefit or that

benefit on january the electric power supply association epsa filed two request with ferc one seeking to amend prior complaint against pjm and another seeking expedited action on pending nyiso

to fund the decommissioning obligation of any other unit the ndt fund associated with generation nuclear unit have been funded with amount collected from the previous owner and their respective utility customer peco is authorized to collect fund in revenue for decommissioning the former peco nuclear plant through regulated rate and these collection are scheduled through the operating life of the former peco plant the amount collected from peco customer are remitted to generation and deposited into the ndt fund for the unit for which fund are collected every five year peco file rate adjustment with the papuc that reflects peco calculation of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former peco unit based on updated fund balance and estimated decommissioning cost the rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from peco customer on march peco filed it nuclear decommissioning cost adjustment ndca with the papuc proposing an annual recovery from

and likewise generation will not be allowed to collect amount associated with the first million of any shortfall of trust fund compared to decommissioning cost well of any additional shortfall on an aggregate basis for all former peco unit the initial million and up to of any additional shortfall would be borne by generation no recourse exists to collect additional amount from utility customer for any of generation other nuclear unit with respect to the former comed and peco unit any fund remaining in the ndts after all decommissioning ha been completed are required to be refunded to comed

fund remaining after decommissioning however in connection with ceng acquisition of the nine mile point and ginna plant and settlement with certain regulatory agency ceng is subject to certain condition pertaining to nuclear decommissioning trust fund that if met could possibly result in obligation to make payment to certain third party clawback for nine mile point and ginna the clawback provision are triggered only in the event that the required decommissioning activity are discontinued or not started or completed in timely manner in the event that the clawback provision are triggered for nine mile point then depending upon the triggering event an amount equal to of the total amount withdrawn from the fund for non decommissioning activity or of any excess fund in the trust fund above the amount required for decommissioning including spent fuel management and decommissioning is to be paid to the nine mile point seller in the event that the clawback provision are

snf dry storage facility associated with zion station pursuant to the asa zionsolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the zion station related ndt fund for cost incurred related to it decommissioning effort at zion station during energysolutions entered definitive acquisition agreement and wa acquired by another company generation reviewed the acquisition it relates to the asa to decommission zion station based on that review generation determined that the acquisition will not adversely impact decommissioning activity under the asa zionsolutions is subject to certain restriction on it ability to request reimbursement from the zion station ndt fund defined within the asa therefore the transfer of the zion station asset did not qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and result the related ndt fund were reclassified to pledged asset for zion station decommissioning within generation and exelon consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be measured

of default including special purpose easement for disposal capacity at the energysolutions site in clive utah for all llrw volume of zion station nrc minimum funding requirement nrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that fund will be available in specified minimum amount to decommission the facility at the end of it life the estimated decommissioning obligation calculated using the nrc methodology differ from the aro recorded on generation and exelon consolidated balance sheet primarily due to difference in the type of cost included in the estimate the basis for estimating such cost and assumption regarding the decommissioning alternative to be used potential license renewal decommissioning cost escalation and the growth rate in the ndt fund under nrc regulation if the minimum funding requirement calculated under the nrc methodology are le than the future value of the ndt fund also calculated under the nrc methodology then the nrc requires either further funding or other financial guarantee key assumption used in the minimum funding calculation using the nrc methodology at december include consideration of cost only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit the option on unit by unit basis to use generic non site specific cost estimate consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit the plant cease operation at the end of their current license life with no assumed license renewal for those unit that have not already received renewal and with an assumed end of operation date of for oyster creek and for tmi the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimate that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning nor discounted using the carfr and assumed annual after tax return on the ndt fund of for the former peco unit specified by the papuc in contrast the key criterion and assumption used by generation to determine the aro and to forecast the target growth in the ndt fund at december include the use of site specific cost estimate that are updated at least once every five year the inclusion in the aro estimate of all legally unavoidable cost required to decommission the unit radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain unit on site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operation and until doe acceptance and disposal of certain low level radioactive waste the consideration of multiple scenario where decommissioning and site restoration activity applicable are completed under four possible scenario ranging from to year after the cessation of plant operation the consideration of multiple end of life scenario the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated cost and an annual average accretion of the aro of approximately through period of approximately year after the end of the extended life of the unit and an estimated targeted annual pre tax return on the ndt fund of to compared to historical year annual average pre tax return of approximately generation is required to provide to the nrc biennial report by unit annually for unit that have been retired or are within five year of the current approved license life based on value of december addressing generation ability to meet the nrc minimum funding level depending of

funding assurance of december and will include the early retirement of tmi announced on may in addition to an adjustment for the february announced retirement date for oyster creek shortfall at any unit could necessitate that exelon post parental guarantee for generation share of the funding assurance however the amount of any required guarantee will ultimately depend on the decommissioning approach adopted the associated level of cost and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward the future value of trust fund change due to market condition the nrc minimum

allocated among the final group of prps generation ha determined that loss associated with the epa partial excavation and enhanced landfill cover remedy is probable and ha recorded liability of december included in the table above that reflects management best estimate of cotter allocable share of the ultimate cost for the entire remediation effort given the joint and several nature of this liability the magnitude of generation ultimate liability will depend on the actual cost incurred to implement the ultimate required remediation remedy well on the nature and term of any cost sharing arrangement with the final group of prps therefore it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost and generation associated allocable share recorded of december could differ significantly once these uncertainty are resolved which could have material impact on exelon and generation future financial condition result of operation and cash flow on january the prps were advised by the epa that it will begin an additional investigation and evaluation of groundwater condition at the west lake landfill the prps have been provided with draft statement of work that will form the basis of an administrative settlement agreement and order on consent for the performance by the prps of the groundwater ri and reimbursement of epa oversight cost the purpose of this new ri are to define the nature and extent of any groundwater contamination from the west lake landfill site determine the potential risk posed to human health and the environment and evaluate remedial alternative generation estimate the undiscounted cost for the groundwater ri for west lake to be approximately million and generation ha recorded liability of december included in the table above that reflects management best estimate of cotter allocable share of the cost among the prps at this time generation can not predict the likelihood or the extent to which if any remediation activity will be required and can not estimate reasonably possible range of loss for response cost beyond those associated with the ri component it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation future result of operation and cash flow during december the epa took two action related to the west lake landfill designed to abate what it termed imminent and dangerous condition at the landfill the first involved installation by the prps of non combustible surface cover to protect against surface fire in area where radiological material are believed to have been disposed generation ha accrued what it belief to be an adequate amount to cover it anticipated liability for this interim action and the work is expected to be completed in the second action involved epa public statement that it will require the prps to construct barrier wall in an adjacent landfill to prevent subsurface fire from spreading to those area of the west lake landfill where radiological material are believed to have been disposed at this time generation belief that the requirement to build barrier wall is remote in light of other technology that have been employed by the adjacent landfill owner finally one of the other prps the landfill owner and operator of the adjacent landfill ha indicated that it will be making contribution claim against cotter for cost that it ha incurred to prevent the subsurface fire from spreading to those area of the west lake landfill where radiological material are believed to have been disposed at this time exelon of contentscombined note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted and generation do not posse sufficient information to ass this claim and therefore are unable to estimate range of loss if any such no liability ha been recorded for the potential contribution claim it is reasonably possible however that resolution of this matter could have material unfavorable impact on exelon and generation financial condition result of operation and cash flow on august cotter wa notified by the doj that cotter is considered prp with respect to the government clean up cost for contamination attributable to low level radioactive residue at former storage and reprocessing facility named latty avenue near st louis missouri the latty avenue site is included in comed indemnification responsibility discussed above part of the sale of cotter the radioactive residue had been generated initially in connection with the processing of uranium ore part of the government manhattan project cotter purchased the residue in for initial processing at the latty avenue facility for the subsequent extraction of uranium and metal in the nrc found that the latty avenue site had radiation level exceeding nrc criterion for decontamination of land area latty avenue wa investigated and remediated by the united state army corp of engineer pursuant to funding under fusrap the doj ha not yet formally advised the prps of the amount that it is seeking but it is believed to be approximately million from all prps the doj and the prps agreed to toll the statute of limitation until august so that settlement discussion could proceed generation ha determined that loss associated with this matter is probable under it indemnification agreement with cotter and ha recorded an estimated liability which is included in the table above commencing in february number of lawsuit have been filed in the district court for the eastern district of missouri among the defendant were exelon generation and comed all of which were subsequently dismissed from the case well cotter which remains defendant the suit allege that individual living in the north st louis area developed some form of cancer or other serious illness due to cotter negligent or reckless conduct in processing transporting storing handling and or disposing of radioactive material plaintiff are asserting public liability claim under the price anderson act their state law claim for negligence strict liability emotional distress and medical monitoring have been dismissed the complaint do not contain specific damage claim in the event of finding of liability against cotter it is reasonably possible that generation would be financially responsible due to it indemnification responsibility of cotter described above the court ha dismissed number of the lawsuit untimely and that ruling is currently on appeal pre trial motion and discovery are proceeding in the remaining case and pre trial scheduling order ha been filed with the court at this stage of the litigation generation can not estimate range of loss if any such no liability ha been recorded for these lawsuit benning road site in

decree doe not obligate pepco or pepco energy service to pay for or perform any remediation work but it is anticipated that doee will look to pepco and pepco energy service to assume responsibility

consultative working group to provide input into the process for future remedial action addressing the entire tidal reach of the river and to ensure proper coordination with the other river cleanup effort currently underway including cleanup of the river segment adjacent to the benning road site resulting from the benning ri pepco responded that it will participate in the consultative working group but it participation is not an acceptance of any financial responsibility beyond the work that will be performed at the benning road site described above doee ha advised the consultative working group that the federal and doee authority are conducting the remedial investigation and that feasibility study of potential remedy is being prepared doee currently is working under statutorily
