the consolidated financial statement we experience moderate fluctuation in aggregate sale volume during the year historically revenue in the first and fourth fiscal quarter have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarter however the mix of product sale may vary considerably result of change in seasonal and geographic demand for particular type of footwear apparel and equipment nike is consumer product company the relative popularity of various sport and fitness activity and changing design trend affect the demand for our product we must therefore respond to trend and shift in consumer preference by adjusting the mix of existing product offering developing new product style and category and influencing sport and fitness preference through extensive marketing failure to

june through november were billion compared to billion for the same period last year this future order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rate under which our revenue will be translated during this period reported future order are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue for this period this is because the mix of order shift future and at order and the fulfillment of certain of these future order may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation well differing level of discount order cancellation and return can cause difference in the comparison between future order and actual revenue moreover significant portion of our revenue is not derived from future order including at once and close sale of nike brand footwear and apparel sale of nike brand equipment sale from our direct to consumer operation and sale from our other business product research and developmentwe believe our research and development effort are key factor in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis nike strives to produce product that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort in addition to nike own staff of specialist in the area of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related field we also utilize research committee and advisory board made of athlete coach trainer equipment manager orthopedist podiatrist and other expert who consult with and review design material concept for product and manufacturing process improvement and compliance with product safety regulation around the world employee athlete athlete engaged under sport marketing contract and other athlete wear test and evaluate product during the design and development process manufacturingvirtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united state by independent contract manufacturer in fiscal contract factory in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately and of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreement with independent factory in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those country the largest single footwear factory with which we have contracted accounted for approximately of total fiscal nike brand footwear production almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united state by independent contract manufacturer located in country most of this apparel production occurred in china vietnam thailand indonesia sri lanka pakistan malaysia turkey mexico and cambodia the largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately of total fiscal apparel production the principal material used in our footwear product are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compound foam cushioning material nylon leather canvas and polyurethane film used to make air sole cushioning component during fiscal nike ihm inc wholly owned subsidiary of nike inc with facility in beaverton oregon and st louis missouri well independent contractor in china and vietnam were our largest supplier of the air sole cushioning component used in footwear the principal material used in our apparel product are natural and synthetic fabric and thread plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabric designed to repel rain and snow retain heat or efficiently wick moisture away from the body nike independent contractor and supplier buy raw material in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment product most raw material are available and purchased by those independent contractor and supplier in the country manufacturing take place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirement since sojitz corporation of america sojitz america large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock ha performed significant import export financing service for during fiscal sojitz america provided financing and purchasing service for nike brand product sold in argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippine malaysia south africa korea and thailand excluding product produced and sold in the same country approximately of nike brand sale occurred in those country any failure of sojitz america to provide these service or any failure of sojitz america bank could disrupt our ability to acquire product from our supplier and to deliver product to our customer in those market such disruption could result in canceled order that would adversely affect sale and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative source of financing at competitive rate our current agreement with sojitz america expire on may international operation and tradeour international operation and source of supply are subject to the usual risk of business abroad such possible revaluation of currency export and import duty anti dumping measure quota safeguard measure trade restriction restriction on the transfer of fund and in certain part of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk can not predict the likelihood of such material effect occurring in the future in recent year uncertain global and regional economic condition have affected international trade and caused rise in protectionist action around the world these trend are affecting many global manufacturing and service sector and the footwear and apparel industry whole are not immune company in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different region and in nearly all case we are working together with industry group to address trade issue and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition law notwithstanding our effort such protectionist measure if implemented could result in increase in the cost of our product which may in turn adversely affect our sale or profitability well the imported footwear and apparel industry whole we monitor protectionist trend and development throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and engage in administrative and judicial process to mitigate trade restriction in brazil we are actively monitoring for dumping investigation product from china and other country that may result in additional anti dumping measure and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediment that may increase custom clearance time for import of footwear apparel and equipment moreover with respect to trade restriction targeting china which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for we are working with broad coalition of global business and trade association representing wide variety of sector to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented address legitimate and core concern ii is consistent with international trade rule and iii reflects and considers china domestic economy and the important role ha in the global economic community where trade protection measure are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop period of time adequate alternative source of supply for the product obtained from our present supplier if event prevented from acquiring product from our supplier in particular country our operation could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of short term nature although alternate source of supply might not be cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability of contentscompetitionthe athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the united state and on worldwide basis we compete internationally with significant number of athletic and leisure footwear company athletic and leisure apparel company sport equipment company and large company diversified line of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas corp puma li ning and under armour among others we also compete with number of vertical retailer such lululemon and uniqlo the intense competition and the rapid change in technology and consumer preference in the market for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factor in our operation nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear

compete internationally with significant number of athletic and leisure footwear company athletic and leisure apparel company sport equipment company and large company having diversified line of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other company for the production capacity of independent manufacturer that produce our product and for import quota capacity our competitor product offering technology marketing expenditure including expenditure for advertising and endorsement pricing cost of production and customer service are area of intense competition this in addition to rapid change in technology and consumer preference in the market for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factor in our operation if we not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitor our cost may increase or the consumer demand for our product may decline significantly failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business our iconic brand have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brand will depend on our design and marketing effort including advertising and consumer campaign product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including material and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objective or if the reputation or image of any of our brand is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in and reduce long term demand for our product even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to rapidly changing medium environment including our increasing reliance on social medium and online dissemination of advertising campaign negative post or comment about on social networking website could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image our product sale financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected of contentsif we are unable to anticipate consumer preference and develop new product we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenue and profit our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trend well to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demand in timely manner however long lead time for many of our product may make it more difficult for to respond rapidly to new or changing product trend or consumer preference all of our product are subject to changing consumer preference that can not be predicted with certainty our new product may not receive consumer acceptance consumer preference could shift rapidly to different type of performance product or away from these type of product altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these change if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trend and shift in consumer preference by adjusting the mix of existing product offering developing new product design style and category and influencing sport and fitness preference through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sale excess inventory and lower profit margin any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition in addition we market our product globally through diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional program and campaign including social medium and online advertising if we do not successfully market our product or if advertising and promotional cost increase these factor could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we rely on technical innovation and high quality product to compete in the market for our product technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our product research and development play key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialist in the field of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related field well research committee and advisory board made up of athlete coach trainer equipment manager orthopedist podiatrist and other expert to develop and test cutting edge performance product while we strive to produce product that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our product consumer demand for our product could decline and if we experience problem with the quality of our product we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problem failure to continue to obtain high quality endorser of our product could harm our business we establish relationship with professional athlete sport team and league to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumer if certain endorser were to stop using our product contrary to their endorsement agreement our business could be adversely affected in addition action taken by athlete team or league associated with our product that harm the reputation of those athlete team or league or negative post or comment about our sport marketing endorsement on social networking website could also seriously harm our brand image with consumer and result could have an adverse effect on our sale and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorser failure to continue to correctly identify promising athlete to use and endorse our product or failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangement with prominent athlete and sport organization could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sale of our product global capital and credit market condition and resulting decline in consumer confidence and spending could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact business around the world continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit market have led to fluctuation in the availability of business credit and capital liquidity contraction of consumer credit business failure higher unemployment and decline in consumer confidence and spending in many part of the world if global economic and financial market condition deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factor could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition slower consumer spending may result in reduced demand for our product reduced order from retailer for our product order cancellation lower revenue higher discount increased inventory and lower gross margin we may be unable to find suitable investment that are safe liquid and provide reasonable return this could result in lower interest income or longer investment horizon disruption to capital market or the banking system may also impair the value of investment or bank deposit we currently consider safe or liquid in the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital market at reasonable rate in the event we find it desirable to do the failure of financial institution counterparties to honor their obligation to under credit and derivative instrument could jeopardize our ability to rely on and benefit from those instrument our ability to replace those instrument on the same or similar term may be limited under poor market condition we conduct transaction in various currency which increase our exposure to fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate relative to the dollar continued volatility in the market and exchange rate for foreign currency and contract in foreign currency could have significant impact on our reported financial result and condition continued volatility and availability in the market and price for commodity and raw material we use in our product and in our supply chain such cotton or petroleum derivative could have material adverse effect on our cost gross margin and profitability if retailer of our product experience declining revenue or retailer experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase our product this could result in reduced order for our product order cancellation inability of retailer to timely meet their payment obligation to extended payment term higher account receivable reduced cash flow greater expense associated with collection effort and increased bad debt expense if retailer of our product experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operation which could reduce the availability of our product to consumer if contract manufacturer of our product or other participant in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit market to purchase raw material or to finance general working capital need it may result in delay or non delivery of shipment of our product of contentsour business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuation in our operating result and stock price we experience moderate fluctuation in aggregate sale volume during the year historically revenue in the first and fourth fiscal quarter have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarter however the mix of product sale may vary considerably from time to time result of change in seasonal and geographic demand for particular type of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customer may cancel order change delivery schedule or change the mix of product ordered with minimal notice result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sale accordingly our result of operation are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factor that are beyond our control including general economic condition change in consumer preference weather condition availability of import quota and currency exchange rate fluctuation could adversely affect our business and cause our result of operation to fluctuate our operating margin are also sensitive to number of factor that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation cost shift in product sale mix geographic sale trend and currency exchange rate fluctuation all of which we expect to continue result of operation in any period should not be considered indicative of the result to be expected for any future period future order may not be an accurate indication of our future revenue we make substantial use of our future ordering program which allows retailer to order five to six month in advance of delivery with the commitment that their order will be delivered within set period of time at fixed price our future ordering program allows to minimize the amount of product we hold in inventory purchasing cost the time necessary to fill customer order and the risk of non delivery we report change in future order in our periodic financial report although we believe future order are an important indicator of our future revenue reported future order are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of change in revenue for any future period this is because the mix of order can shift between future and at once order in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation order cancellation shipping timing return and discount can cause difference in the comparison between future order and actual revenue moreover significant portion of our revenue is not derived from future order including at once and close out sale of nike brand footwear and apparel sale of nike brand equipment sale from our direct to consumer operation and sale from our other business our future ordering program doe not prevent excess inventory or inventory shortage which could result in decreased operating margin and harm to our business we purchase product from manufacturer outside of our future ordering program and in advance of customer order which we hold in inventory and resell to customer is risk we may be unable to sell excess product ordered from manufacturer inventory level in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write down and the sale of excess inventory at discounted price could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating result and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our product or if our manufacturer fail to supply product we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortage inventory shortage

and construction of additional store these situation concentrate our credit risk with relatively small number of retailer and if any of these retailer were to experience shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payable to may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or few retailer in particular country or region increase the risk that

production of nike branded product factory input cost are denominated for the currency within the factory currency exposure index that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventory and is recognized in cost of sale when the related product is sold to third party all currency within the index excluding the dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized embedded derivative contract and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net refer to note risk management and derivative for additional detail an offset to the impact of the fluctuating dollar on our non functional currency denominated product purchase described above strengthening dollar against the foreign currency within the factory currency exposure index decrease nike dollar inventory cost conversely weakening dollar against the indexed foreign currency increase our inventory cost non functional currency denominated external sale portion of our western europe and central eastern europe geography revenue are earned in currency other than the euro british pound but are recognized at subsidiary that us the euro it functional currency these sale generate foreign currency exposure other cost non functional currency denominated cost such endorsement contract intercompany royalty and other intercompany charge also generate foreign currency risk though to lesser extent non functional currency denominated monetary asset and liability our global subsidiary have various asset and liability primarily receivables and payable denominated in currency other than their functional currency these balance sheet item are subject to re measurement which may create fluctuation in other income expense net within our consolidated result of operation managing transactional exposurestransactional exposure are managed on portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposure by taking advantage of natural offset and currency correlation that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contract to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuation on probable forecasted future cash flow including certain product cost exposure non functional currency denominated external sale and other cost described above generally these are accounted for cash flow hedge in accordance with the accounting standard for derivative and hedging except for hedge of the embedded derivative component of the product cost exposure discussed below certain currency forward contract used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non functional currency denominated monetary asset and liability subject to re measurement and the embedded derivative contract discussed above are not formally designated hedging instrument under the accounting standard for derivative and hedging accordingly change in fair value of these instrument are immediately recognized in other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the re measurement of the related non functional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged refer to note fair value measurement and note risk management and derivative in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for additional description of how the above financial instrument are valued and recorded well the fair value of outstanding derivative at period end translational exposuresmany of our foreign subsidiary operate in functional currency other than the dollar fluctuation in currency exchange rate create volatility in our reported result we are required to translate the balance sheet operational result and cash flow of these subsidiary into dollar for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiary non dollar denominated balance sheet into dollar for consolidated reporting result in cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholder equity in the translation of our consolidated statement of income weaker dollar in relation to foreign functional currency benefit our consolidated earnings whereas stronger dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our consolidated revenue wa benefit detriment of approximately million and million for the year ended may and respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate of contentsfluctuations on the translation of our income before income tax wa benefit detriment of approximately million and million for the year ended may and respectively managing translational exposuresto minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenue and expense into dollar for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiary use excess cash to purchase dollar denominated available for sale investment the variable future cash flow associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these dollar denominated security at non dollar functional currency subsidiary creates foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standard for derivative and hedging we utilize forward contract and or option to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchase and sale of these dollar investment the combination of the purchase and sale of the dollar investment and the hedging instrument ha the effect of partially offsetting the year over year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investment are sold hedge of available for sale investment are accounted for cash flow hedge refer to note fair value measurement and note risk management and derivative in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement for additional description of how the above financial instrument are valued and recorded well the fair value of outstanding derivative at period end we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency denominated profit from our international business and the year over year change in foreign currency related gain and loss included in other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately million on our income before income tax for the year ended may and had an insignificant impact for the year ended may net investment in foreign subsidiarieswe are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation on our investment in wholly owned foreign subsidiary denominated in currency other than the dollar which could adversely impact the dollar value of these investment and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have hedged and may in the future hedge net investment position in certain foreign subsidiary to mitigate the effect of foreign exchange fluctuation on these net investment in accordance with the accounting standard for derivative and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contract designated net investment hedge is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings component of other income expense net the impact of ineffective hedge wa not material for any period presented to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedge to be generally le than six month in duration upon maturity the hedge are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contract with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci there were no outstanding net investment hedge of may and cash flow from net investment hedge settlement totaled million for the year ended may liquidity and capital resourcescash flow activitycash provided by operation wa billion for fiscal compared to billion for fiscal our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal wa net income of billion our fiscal change in working capital wa net cash outflow of million which is exclusive of working capital amount sold part of the divestiture of umbro and cole haan compared to net cash outflow of million for fiscal our investment in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reduction in account receivable compared to the prior year during fiscal inventory for continuing operation increased compared to increase for fiscal the slowing growth wa driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity the reduction in account receivable wa primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operation cash used by investing activity wa million during fiscal compared to million source of cash for fiscal major driver of the change wa the swing from net sale maturity of short term investment in fiscal to net purchase of short term investment in fiscal reflective of the additional purchase of short term investment made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in april in fiscal there were million of net sale maturity of short term investment net of purchase while in fiscal we made million in net purchase of short term investment net of sale maturity this impact wa partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of umbro and cole haan in fiscal cash used by financing activity wa million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash used by financing activity wa primarily due to million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in april also contributing to the decrease were lower payment of long term debt and note payable and lower repurchase of common stock which were partially offset by reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock option in fiscal we purchased million share of nike class common stock for billion an average price of during the year we completed the four year billion share repurchase program approved by our board of director in september under that program we purchased total of million share at an average price of subsequently we began repurchase under four year billion program approved by the board in september of the end of fiscal we had repurchased million share at cost of million under this current program we continue to expect funding of share repurchase will come from operating cash flow excess cash and or debt the timing and the amount of share purchased will be dictated by our capital need and stock market condition capital resourceson april we filed shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec which permit to issue an unlimited amount of debt security the shelf expires on april on april we issued billion of senior note with tranche maturing in and the senior note were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of million at fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may the senior note were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of million at fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may interest on the senior note is payable semi annually on may and november of each year the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expense of million we will use the net proceeds for general corporate purpose which may include but are not of contentslimited to discharging or refinancing debt working capital capital expenditure share repurchase yet unplanned acquisition of asset or business and investment in subsidiary on november we entered into committed credit facility agreement with syndicate of bank which provides for up to billion of borrowing with the option to increase borrowing to billion with lender approval the facility matures november with one year extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date provided that extension shall not extend beyond november of and for the year ended may we had no amount outstanding under our committed credit facility we currently have long term debt rating of and from standard and poor corporation and moody investor service respectively if our long term debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our long term debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease change in our long term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowing or any future borrowing under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenant these covenant include limit on our disposal of fixed asset the amount of debt secured by lien we may incur well minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowing outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain waiver from majority of the bank in the syndicate any borrowing would become immediately due and payable of may we were in full compliance with each of these covenant and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenant in the foreseeable future liquidity is also provided by our billion commercial paper program during the year ended may we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowing of million of may there were no outstanding borrowing under this program we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt security during fiscal depending on general corporate need we currently have short term debt rating of and from standard and poor corporation and moody investor service respectively of may we had cash cash equivalent and short term investment totaling billion of which billion wa held by our foreign subsidiary cash equivalent and short term investment consist primarily of deposit held at major bank money market fund tier commercial paper corporate note treasury obligation government sponsored enterprise obligation and other investment grade fixed income security our fixed income investment are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investment are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual security have varying duration of may the average duration of our short term investment and cash equivalent portfolio is day despite recent uncertainty in the financial market to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit market or incurred higher interest cost future volatility in the capital market however may increase cost associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instrument or affect our ability to access those market we believe that existing cash cash equivalent short term investment and cash generated by operation together with access to external source of fund described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital need in the foreseeable future we utilize variety of tax planning and financing strategy to manage our worldwide cash and deploy fund to location where they are needed we routinely repatriate portion of our foreign earnings for which tax have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plan do not demonstrate need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign fund or raise capital in the through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign fund we would be required to accrue and pay additional tax le applicable foreign tax credit if we elect to raise capital in the through debt we would incur additional interest expense off balance sheet arrangementsin connection with various contract and agreement we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property right coverage for legal issue that arise and other item where we are acting the guarantor currently we have several such agreement in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or result of operation contractual obligationsour significant long term contractual obligation of may and significant endorsement contract entered into through the date of this report are follows description of commitment cash payment due during the year ending may in million thereafter totaloperating lease lease term debt contract purchase obligation the amount listed for endorsement contract represent approximate amount of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fee we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorser of our product actual payment under some contract may be higher than the amount listed these contract provide for bonus to be paid to the endorser based upon athletic achievement and or royalty on product sale in future period actual payment under some contract may also be lower these contract include provision for reduced payment if athletic performance decline in future period in addition to the cash payment we are obligated to furnish our endorser with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis the contract generally do not stipulate specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorser will depend on many factor including general playing condition the number of contentsof sporting event in which they participate and our own decision regarding product and marketing initiative in addition the cost to design develop source and purchase the product furnished to the endorser are incurred over period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar cost incurred for product sold to customer we generally order product at least to month in advance of sale based primarily on future order received from customer the amount listed for product purchase obligation represent agreement including open purchase order to purchase product in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant term in some case price are subject to change throughout the production process the reported amount exclude product purchase liability included in account payable on the consolidated balance sheet of may other amount primarily include service and marketing commitment made in the ordinary course of business the amount represent the minimum payment required by legally binding contract and agreement that specify all significant term including open purchase order for non product purchase the reported amount exclude those liability included in account payable or accrued liability on the consolidated balance sheet of may the total liability for uncertain tax position wa million excluding related interest and penalty at may we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payment of the long term liability for uncertain tax position will occur we also have the following outstanding short term debt obligation of may refer to note short term borrowing and credit line for further description and interest rate related to the short term debt obligation listed below in million outstanding of may payable due at mutually agreed upon date within one year of issuance or on demand to sojitz america for the purchase of inventory generally due day after shipment of good from foreign of may letter of credit of million were outstanding which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and guarantee of the company performance under certain self insurance and other program recently adopted accounting standardsin july the financial accounting standard board fasb issued an accounting standard update intended to simplify how an entity test indefinite lived intangible asset other than goodwill for impairment by providing entity with an option to perform qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary this accounting standard update will be effective for beginning june and early adoption is permitted we early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in september the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment this guidance will allow company to ass qualitative factor to determine if it is more likely than not that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standard this new guidance wa effective for beginning june the adoption did not have material effect on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in june the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and it component in the statement of shareholder equity company are required to present the component of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement referred to the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statement this requirement wa effective for beginning june this guidance only amended the presentation of the component of comprehensive income the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation further this guidance required company to present reclassification adjustment out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented this requirement will be effective for beginning june this guidance only amends the presentation of the component of comprehensive income we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation recently issued accounting standardsin december the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirement surrounding the nature of an entity right to offset and related arrangement associated with it financial instrument and derivative instrument this new guidance requires company to disclose both gross and net information about instrument and transaction eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instrument and transaction subject to master netting arrangement this new guidance is effective for beginning june this guidance only requires expanded disclosure we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation critical accounting policiesour previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we believe that the estimate assumption and judgment involved in the accounting policy described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statement so we consider these to be our critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty inherent in these matter actual result could differ from the estimate we use in applying the critical accounting policy certain of these critical accounting policy affect working capital account balance including the policy for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible account receivable inventory reserve and contingent payment under endorsement contract these policy require that we make estimate in the preparation of our financial statement of given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual result related to these estimate are generally known within the of contentssix month period following the financial statement date thus these policy generally affect only the timing of reported amount across two to three fiscal quarter within the context of these critical accounting policy we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely event or circumstance that would result in materially different amount being reported revenue recognitionwe record wholesale revenue when title pass and the risk and reward of ownership have passed to the customer based on the term of sale title pass generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenue are recorded at the time of sale in some instance we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenue may fluctuate in case when our customer delay accepting shipment of product for period of up to several week in certain country outside of the precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these case we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery time by geographic location on the basis of our test of actual transaction we have no indication that these estimate have been materially inaccurate historically part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sale return discount and miscellaneous claim from customer reduction to revenue at the time revenue are recorded our post invoice sale discount consist of contractual program with certain customer or discretionary discount that are expected to be granted to certain customer at later date we base our estimate on historical rate of product return discount and claim specific identification of outstanding claim and outstanding return not yet received from customer and estimated return discount and claim expected but not yet finalized with our customer actual return discount and claim in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimate if actual or expected future return discount and claim were significantly greater or lower than the reserve we had established we would record reduction or increase to net revenue in the period in which we made such determination allowance for uncollectible account receivablewe make ongoing estimate relating to the ability to collect our account receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated loss resulting from the inability of our customer to make required payment in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit loss and make judgment about the creditworthiness of significant customer based on ongoing credit evaluation since we can not predict future change in the financial stability of our customer actual future loss from uncollectible account may differ from our estimate if the financial condition of our customer were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payment larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record credit or charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such determination is made inventory reserveswe also make ongoing estimate relating to the net realizable value of inventory based upon our assumption about future demand and market condition if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is le than the cost of the inventory recorded on our book we record reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded charge to cost of sale if change in market condition result in reduction in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such determination and record charge to cost of sale contingent payment under endorsement contractsa significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payment under endorsement contract in general endorsement payment are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract element may be accounted for differently based upon the fact and circumstance of each individual contract some of the contract provide for contingent payment to endorser based upon specific achievement in their sport winning championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amount when the endorser achieves the specific goal some of the contract provide for payment based upon endorser maintaining level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time maintaining top ranking in sport for year these amount are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instance to the extent that actual payment to the endorser differ from our estimate due to change in the endorser athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in future period some of the contract provide for royalty payment to endorser based upon predetermined percentage of sale of particular product we expense these payment in cost of sale the related sale occur in certain contract we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payment for contractual obligation for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fee through sale of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sale of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period property plant and equipment and definite lived assetsproperty plant and equipment including building equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some case the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life change in circumstance such technological advance or change to our business operation can result in difference between the actual and estimated useful life in those case where we determine that the useful life of long lived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset net book value to it salvage value we review the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant of contentsadverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment we would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset we perform annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor we may first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it carrying amount the two step impairment test is unnecessary the two step impairment test requires to estimate the fair value of our reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over it implied fair value if any we generally base our measurement of the fair value of reporting unit on blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flow model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flow that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimate in the discounted cash flow model include our weighted average cost of capital long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit business and working capital effect the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business significant estimate in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar company with comparable business factor such size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiple in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset primarily consist of acquired trade name and trademark we may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible asset we utilize the relief from royalty method this method assumes that trade name and trademark have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalty for the benefit received from them this method requires to estimate the future revenue for the related brand the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital fair value measurementsfor financial asset and liability measured at fair value on recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability to determine the fair value of our financial instrument this pricing methodology applies to our level investment including treasury security in the absence of active market for identical asset or liability such measurement involve developing assumption based on market observable data including quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market and quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level investment such commercial paper and bond agency security and money market fund level investment are valued using internally developed model with unobservable input asset and liability measured using unobservable input are an immaterial portion of our portfolio majority of our available for sale security are priced by pricing vendor and are generally level or level investment these vendor either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable input without applying significant adjustment in their pricing observable input include broker quote interest rate and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit risk our fair value process include control that are designed to ensure appropriate fair value are recorded these control include an analysis of period over period fluctuation and comparison to another independent pricing vendor hedge accounting for derivativeswe use forward and option contract to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transaction well certain non functional currency monetary asset and liability when the specific criterion to qualify for hedge accounting ha been met change in the fair value of contract hedging probable forecasted future cash flow are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affect net income in most case this result in gain and loss on hedge derivative being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criterion for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transaction by their very nature our estimate of anticipated transaction may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transaction when anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decline below hedged level or if it is no longer probable that forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which such change occur we have used and may in the future use forward contract to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiary the change in fair value of the forward contract hedging our net investment is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholder equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustment on those investment the value of our underlying net of contentsinvestments in wholly owned international subsidiary is known at the time hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedge is substantially le than that of other type of hedge transaction and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationship based on change in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged level the cumulative change in fair value of the over hedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which change occur stock based compensationwe account for stock based compensation by estimating the fair value of stock based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumption including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded option on our common stock with term greater than one year along with other factor our decision to use implied volatility wa based on the availability of actively traded option on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trend than historical volatility if factor change and we use different assumption for estimating stock based compensation expense in future period stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period taxeswe record valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset when necessary realization of deferred tax asset such net operating loss carry forward is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we ass the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increase our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made in addition we have not recorded income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore asset and our expectation of the future cash need of our and foreign entity income tax consideration are also factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore we carefully review all factor that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standard to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plan and expectation of future event the possibility exists that amount declared indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash need of our entity may exceed our current expectation or the actual cash need of our foreign entity may be le than our current expectation this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amount were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which income tax have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year to date pre tax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual item to determine the year to date tax expense the income tax effect of infrequent or unusual item are recognized in the interim period in which they occur the fiscal year progress we continually refine our estimate based upon actual event and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically result in change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs on quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax position based on factor including change in fact or circumstance change in tax law settled audit issue and new audit activity change in our assessment may result in the recognition of tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment change we recognize interest and penalty related to income tax matter in income tax expense other contingenciesin the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceeding regarding contractual and employment relationship product liability claim trademark right and variety of other matter we record contingent liability resulting from claim against including related legal cost when loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable loss requires analysis of multiple factor including in some case judgment about the potential action of third party claimant and court recorded contingent liability are based on the best information available and actual loss in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustment to estimated probable future loss or actual loss exceed our recorded liability for such claim we would record additional charge other income expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liability recorded for probable loss we disclose contingent liability when there is reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we can not predict the outcome of pending legal matter with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have material impact on our result of operation financial position or cash flow of contentsitem quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk in the normal course of business and consistent with established policy and procedure we employ variety of financial instrument to manage exposure to fluctuation in the value of foreign currency and interest rate it is our policy to utilize these financial instrument only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposure we do not enter into these transaction for trading or speculative purpose we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation primarily result of our international sale product sourcing and funding activity our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effect of currency fluctuation on our consolidated result of operation financial position and cash flow we use forward exchange contract and option to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transaction well certain firm commitment and the related receivables and payable including third party and intercompany transaction we have and may in the future also use forward contract to hedge our investment in the net asset of certain international subsidiary to offset foreign currency translation adjustment related to our net investment in those subsidiary where exposure are hedged our program ha the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movement on our consolidated financial statement the timing for hedging exposure well the type and duration of the hedge instrument employed are guided by our hedging policy and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market condition generally hedged transaction are expected to be recognized within to month when intercompany loan are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transaction are principally denominated in euro british pound and japanese yen see section foreign currency exposure and hedging practice under item for additional detail our earnings are also exposed to movement in short and long term market interest rate our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate change on earnings and cash flow and to reduce overall borrowing cost to achieve these objective we maintain mix of commercial paper bank loan and fixed rate debt of varying maturity and have entered into receive fixed pay variable interest rate swap for portion of our fixed rate debt market risk measurementwe monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivative using variety of technique including review of market value sensitivity analysis and value at risk var our market sensitive derivative and other financial instrument are foreign currency forward contract foreign currency option contract interest rate swap intercompany loan denominated in non functional currency fixed interest rate dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instrument only the var determines the maximum potential one day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate sensitive financial instrument the var model estimate assume normal market condition and confidence level there are various modeling technique that can be used in the var computation our computation are based on interrelationship between currency and interest rate variance co variance technique these interrelationship are function of foreign exchange currency market change and interest rate change over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency option doe not change on one to one basis with change in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the delta and gamma to change in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuation on the derivative instrument only and doe not include the impact of such rate fluctuation on non functional currency transaction such anticipated transaction firm commitment cash balance and account and loan receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instrument the var model is risk analysis tool and doe not purport to represent actual loss in fair value that we will incur nor doe it consider the potential effect of favorable change in market rate it also doe not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gain and loss will differ from those estimated because of change or difference in market rate and interrelationship hedging instrument and hedge percentage timing and other factor the estimated maximum one day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instrument derived using the var model wa million and million at may and respectively the var increased year over year result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with longer average duration on our outstanding trade at may such hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivative would be offset by increase in the value of the underlying transaction being hedged the average monthly change in the fair value of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instrument wa million and million during fiscal and fiscal

denominated debt and interest rate swap intercompany loan and related interest amount are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our non functional currency intercompany loan are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contract which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risk associated with our non functional currency intercompany loan to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position result from operation and cash flow detail of third party debt and interest rate swap are

long lived asset or asset group to be used in operation whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of the asset might not be recoverable factor that would necessitate an impairment assessment include significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used significant adverse change in legal factor or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such fact indicate potential impairment the company would ass the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds of contentsthe sum of the projected undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable the company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodology which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flow any impairment would be measured the difference between the asset group carrying amount and it estimated fair value identifiable intangible asset and goodwillthe company performs annual impairment test on goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite life in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when event occur or circumstance change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below it carrying value event or change in circumstance that may trigger interim impairment review include significant change in business climate operating result planned investment in the reporting unit planned divestiture or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factor the company may first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance the company determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than it carrying amount the two step impairment test is unnecessary the two step impairment test first requires the company to estimate the fair value of it reporting unit if the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company proceeds to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis the company measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over it implied fair value if any the company generally base it measurement of the fair value of reporting unit on blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flow and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flow model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flow that the company expects the reporting unit to generate in the future the company significant estimate in the discounted cash flow model include it weighted average cost of capital long term rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit business and working capital effect the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business significant estimate in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar company with comparable business factor such size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiple in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit indefinite lived intangible asset primarily consist of acquired trade name and trademark the company may first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of event and circumstance the company determines that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible asset the company utilizes the relief from royalty method this method assumes that trade name and trademark have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalty for the benefit received from them this method requires the company to estimate the future revenue for the related brand the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of

measurementsthe company measure certain financial asset and liability at fair value on recurring basis including derivative and available for sale security fair value is the price the company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer liability in an orderly transaction with market participant at the measurement date the company us three level hierarchy established by the financial accounting standard board fasb that prioritizes fair value measurement based on the type of input used for the various valuation technique market approach income approach and cost approach the level of hierarchy are described below level observable input such quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than quoted price that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly these include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market and quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active level unobservable input for which there is little or no market data available which require the reporting entity to develop it own assumption the company assessment of the significance of particular input to the fair value measurement in it entirety requires judgment and considers factor specific to the asset or liability financial asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement pricing vendor are utilized for certain level and level investment these vendor either provide quoted market price in an active market or use observable input without applying significant adjustment in their pricing observable input include broker quote interest rate and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit risk the company fair value process include control that are designed to ensure appropriate fair value are recorded these control include an analysis of
