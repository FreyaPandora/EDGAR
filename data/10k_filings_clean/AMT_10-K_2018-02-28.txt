contentsfor more information about our business segment well financial information about the geographic area in which we operate see item of this annual report under the caption management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report product and servicesproperty operationsour property operation accounted for and of our total revenue for the year ended december and respectively our revenue is primarily generated from tenant lease our tenant lease space on our communication real estate where they install and maintain their equipment rental payment vary considerably depending upon numerous factor including but not limited to tower location amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower ground space required by the tenant and remaining tower capacity our cost typically include ground rent which is primarily fixed under long term lease agreement with annual cost escalation and power and fuel cost or all of which may be passed through to our tenant well property tax and repair and maintenance expense our property operation have generated consistent incremental growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristic long term tenant lease with contractual rent escalation in general tenant lease ha an initial non cancellable term of ten year with multiple renewal term with provision that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically annually based on fixed escalation percentage averaging approximately in the united state or an inflationary index in our international market or combination of based upon foreign currency exchange rate and the tenant lease in place of december we expect to generate over billion of non cancellable tenant lease revenue over future period absent the impact of straight line lease accounting consistent demand for our site result of rapidly growing usage of wireless service and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trend in the market we serve we anticipate consistent demand for our communication site we believe that our global asset base position well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless device and the increasing usage of high bandwidth application on those device we have the ability to add new tenant and new equipment for existing tenant on our site which typically result in incremental revenue and modest incremental cost our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide with solid platform for new business opportunity which ha historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth high lease renewal rate our tenant tend to renew lease suitable alternative site may not exist or be available and repositioning site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect the quality of their network historically churn ha averaged approximately to of total property revenue per year we define churn tenant billing lost when tenant cancel or not renew it lease or in limited circumstance when the lease rate on existing lease are reduced we derive our churn rate for given year by dividing our tenant billing lost on this basis by our prior year tenant billing high operating margin incremental operating cost associated with adding new tenant to an existing communication site are relatively minimal therefore tenant are added the substantial majority of incremental revenue flow through to gross margin and operating profit in addition in many of our international market certain expense such ground rent or power and or fuel cost are reimbursed or shared by our tenant base low maintenance capital expenditure on average we require relatively low amount of annual capital expenditure to maintain our communication site our property business includes the operation of communication site and managed network the leasing of property interest the operation of fiber and the provision of backup power through shared generator our presence in number of market different relative stage of wireless development provides with significant diversification and long term growth potential our property segment accounted for the following percentage of total revenue for the year ended december latin of contentscommunications site

area in which zoning restriction or other barrier may prevent or delay deployment of more traditional wireless communication site we also hold lease right and easement interest on rooftop capable of hosting communication equipment in location where tower are generally not viable solution based on area characteristic in addition we provide management service to property owner in the united state elect to retain full right to their property while simultaneously marketing the rooftop for wireless communication equipment installation the demand for advanced wireless service in urban market evolves we continue to evaluate variety of infrastructure solution including small cell and other network architecture including integration with existing local infrastructure that may support our tenant network in these area property interest we own portfolio of property interest in the united state under carrier or other third party communication site which provides recurring cash flow under complementary leasing arrangement fiber we own and operate fiber in argentina mexico and south africa which we currently lease to communication and internet service provider and third party operator

service operationswe offer tower related service including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis service our service operation primarily support our site leasing business including through the addition of new tenant and equipment on our site this segment accounted for and of our total revenue for the year ended december and respectively of contentssite acquisition zoning and permitting we engage in site acquisition service on our own behalf in connection with our tower development project well on behalf of our tenant we typically work with our tenant engineer to determine the geographic area where new communication site will best address the tenant need and meet their coverage objective new site is identified we acquire the right to the land or structure on which the site will be constructed and we manage the permitting process to ensure all necessary approval are obtained to construct and operate the communication site structural analysis we offer structural analysis service to wireless carrier in connection with the installation of their communication equipment on our tower our team of engineer evaluate whether tower structure can support the additional burden of the new equipment or if an upgrade is needed which enables our tenant to better ass potential site making an installation decision our structural analysis capability enable to provide higher quality service to our existing tenant by among other thing reducing the time required to achieve on air readiness while also providing opportunity to offer structural analysis service to third party strategyoperational strategyas the use of wireless service on handset tablet and other advanced mobile device grows and evolves there is corresponding increase in demand for the communication infrastructure required to deploy current and future generation of wireless communication technology to capture this demand our primary operational focus is to increase the occupancy of our existing communication real estate portfolio to support global connectivity ii invest in and selectively grow our communication real estate portfolio iii improve upon our operational performance and efficiency including through innovation and iv maintain strong balance sheet we believe these effort to meet our tenant need will support and enhance our ability to capitalize on the growth in demand for wireless infrastructure in addition we expect to explore new opportunity to enhance or extend our shared communication infrastructure business including those that may make our asset incrementally more attractive to new tenant or to existing tenant for additional us and those that increase our operational efficiency increase the occupancy of our existing communication real estate portfolio to support global connectivity we believe that our highest return will be achieved by leasing additional space on our existing communication site increasing demand for wireless service in our served market ha resulted in significant capital spending by major wireless carrier and other connectivity provider result we anticipate consistent demand for our communication site because they are attractively located and typically have capacity available for additional tenant in the united state incremental carrier network activity is driven primarily by the construction and densification of network while in our international market carrier are deploying combination of second generation third generation and more recently network depending on the specific market of december we global average of approximately tenant per tower we believe that the majority of our tower have capacity for additional tenant and that substantially all of our tower that are currently at or near full structural capacity can be upgraded or augmented to meet future tenant demand with relatively modest capital investment therefore we will continue to target our sale and marketing activity to increase the utilization and return on investment of our existing communication site invest in and selectively grow our communication real estate portfolio to meet our tenant need we seek opportunity to invest in and grow our operation through our capital expenditure program new site construction and acquisition we believe we can achieve attractive risk adjusted return by pursuing such investment in addition we seek to secure property interest under our communication site to improve operating margin we reduce our cash operating expense related to ground lease significant portion of our inorganic growth ha been focused on property with lower initial tenancy because we believe that over time we can significantly increase tenancy level and therefore drive strong return on those asset further

includes capital expenditure associated with site maintenance increasing the capacity of our existing site and project such new site construction land interest acquisition and power solution acquisition we intend to pursue acquisition of communication site in our existing or new market where we can meet or exceed our risk adjusted return on investment criterion our risk adjusted hurdle rate consider additional factor such the country and counterparties involved investment and economic climate legal and regulatory condition and industry risk among others return excess capital to stockholder if we have excess capital available after funding our required distribution ii capital expenditure and iii anticipated future investment including acquisition and select innovation opportunity we will seek to return such excess capital to stockholder including through our stock repurchase program international growth strategywe believe that in certain international market we can

consolidated financial statement included in this annual report regulatory matterstowers and antenna our and international tower leasing business are subject to national state and local regulatory requirement with respect to the registration siting construction lighting marking and maintenance of our tower in the united state which accounted for of our total property segment revenue for the

depending on factor such tower height and proximity to public airfield tower requiring pre approval must be registered with the fcc and maintained in accordance with faa standard similar requirement regarding pre approval of the construction and modification of tower are imposed by regulator in other country non compliance with applicable tower related requirement may lead to monetary penalty or site deconstruction order certain of our international operation are subject to regulatory requirement with respect to licensing registration permitting and public listing in india each of our

argentina in many of the market in which we operate we are required to provide tower space to service provider on non discriminatory basis subject to the negotiation of mutually agreeable term our international business operation may be subject to increased licensing fee or ownership restriction for example in south africa the broad based black economic empowerment act the bbbee act ha established legislative framework for the promotion of economic empowerment of south african citizen disadvantaged by apartheid accordingly the bbbee act and related code measure bbbee act compliance and good corporate practice by the inclusion of certain ownership management control employment equity and other metric for company that do business there in addition certain municipality have sought to impose permit fee based upon structural or operational requirement of tower and certain regional and other governmental body have sought to impose levy and or other form of fee our foreign operation may be affected if country regulatory authority restricts revoke or modifies spectrum license of certain wireless service provider or implement limitation on foreign ownership in all country where we operate we are subject to zoning restriction and restrictive covenant imposed by local authority or community organization while these regulation vary they typically require tower owner or tenant to obtain approval from local authority or community standard organization prior to tower construction or the addition of new antenna to an existing tower local zoning authority and community resident often oppose construction in their community which can delay or prevent new tower construction new antenna installation or site upgrade project thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand this opposition and existing or new zoning regulation can increase cost associated with new tower construction tower modification or addition of new antenna to site or site upgrade well adversely affect the associated timing or cost of such project further additional regulation may be adopted that cause delay or result in additional cost to these factor could materially and adversely affect our operation in the united state the telecommunication act of prohibits any action by state and local authority that would discriminate different provider of wireless service or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of communication site it also prohibits state or local restriction based on the environmental effect of radio frequency emission to the extent the facility comply with fcc regulation further in february the united state government adopted regulation requiring that local and state government approve modification or colocations that qualify eligible facility under the regulation portion of our business are subject to additional regulation for example in number of state throughout the united state certain of our subsidiary hold competitive local exchange carrier clec or other status in connection with the operation of our outdoor da network business in addition we or our tenant may be subject to new regulatory policy in certain jurisdiction from time to time that may materially and adversely affect our business or the demand for our communication site for example there are pending tower marking regulation in the united state compliance with which may result in substantial increase in our cost environmental matter our and international operation are subject to various national state and local environmental law and regulation including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and non hazardous substance material and waste and the siting of our tower we may be required to obtain permit pay additional property tax comply with regulatory requirement and make certain informational filing related to hazardous substance or device used to provide power such battery generator and fuel at our site violation of these type of regulation could subject to fine or criminal sanction additionally in the united state and other international market where we do business before constructing new tower or adding an antenna to an existing site we must review and evaluate the impact of the action to determine whether it may significantly affect the environment and whether we must disclose any significant impact in an environmental assessment if tower or new antenna might have material adverse impact on the environment fcc or other governmental approval of the tower or antenna could be significantly delayed health and safety in the united state and in other country where we operate we are subject to various national state and local law regarding employee health and safety including protection from radio frequency exposure competitionour industry is highly competitive we compete both for new business and for the acquisition of asset with other public tower company such crown castle international corp sba communication corporation telesites de and cellnex telecom wireless carrier tower consortium such indus tower limited and private tower company private of contentsequity sponsored firm carrier affiliated tower company independent wireless carrier tower owner broadcaster and owner of non communication site including rooftop utility tower water tower and other alternative structure we believe that site location and capacity network density price quality and speed of service have been and will continue to be significant competitive factor affecting owner operator and manager of communication site our service business competes with variety of company offering individual or combination of competing service the field of competitor includes site acquisition consultant zoning consultant real estate firm right of way consultant structural engineering firm tower owner manager telecommunication equipment vendor who can provide turnkey site development service through multiple subcontractor and our tenant personnel we believe that our tenant base their decision for service on various criterion including company experience local reputation price and time for completion of project tenant demandour strategy is predicated on the belief that wireless service provider will continue to invest in the coverage quality and capacity of their network in both our and international market while also investing in next generation data network which will drive demand for our communication site to meet these network objective we believe wireless carrier will continue to outsource their communication site infrastructure need mean to accelerate network development and more efficiently use their capital rather than construct and operate their own communication site and maintain their own communication site operation and development capability in addition because our service operation are complementary to our property business we believe demand for our service will continue consistent with industry trend wireless network investment according to industry data recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the united state ha averaged approximately billion resulting in consistent demand for our site demand for our communication site is driven by increasing wireless data usage which continues to incentivize wireless service provider to focus on network quality and make incremental investment in the coverage and capacity of their network subscriber adoption of advanced wireless data application particularly mobile video increasingly advanced device and the corresponding deployment and densification of advanced network by wireless service provider to satisfy this incremental demand for high bandwidth wireless data deployment of newly acquired spectrum and deployment of wireless and backhaul network by new market entrant consumer demand for and use of advanced wireless service in the united state grow wireless service provider may be compelled to deploy new technology and equipment further increase the cell density of their existing network and expand their network coverage international asia emea and latin america wireless network investment the wireless network in most of our international market are typically le advanced than those in our market with respect to the density of voice network and the current technology generally deployed for wireless service accordingly demand for our international communication site is primarily driven by incumbent wireless service provider investing in existing voice network to improve or expand their coverage and increase capacity in many of our international market increasing subscriber adoption of wireless data application such email internet and video spectrum auction which result in new market entrant well initial and incremental data network deployment and the increasing availability of lower cost smartphones demand for our communication site could be negatively impacted by number of factor including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenant set forth in item of this annual report under the caption risk factor if our tenant consolidate their operation or share site infrastructure to significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flow could be materially and adversely affected in addition the emergence and growth of new technology could reduce demand for our site set forth under the caption risk factor new technology or change in tenant business model could make our tower leasing business le desirable and result in decreasing revenue and operating result further our tenant may be subject to new regulatory policy from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communication site of content employeesas of december we employed full time individual and consider our employee relation to be

merger or consolidation that reduce the number of wireless service provider or use of network sharing among government or wireless service provider zoning environmental health tax or other government regulation or change in the application and enforcement thereof the financial condition of wireless service provider governmental licensing of spectrum or restriction or revocation of our tenant spectrum license decrease in consumer demand for wireless service including due to general economic condition or disruption in the financial and credit market the ability and willingness of wireless service provider to maintain or increase capital expenditure on network infrastructure delay or change in the deployment of next generation wireless technology and technological change increasing competition within our industry for tenant may materially and adversely affect our revenue our industry is highly competitive and our tenant have numerous alternative in leasing antenna space pricing competition from peer could materially and adversely affect our lease rate we may not be able to renew existing tenant lease or enter into new tenant lease or if we are able to renew or enter into new

percentage in market where our lease include fixed escalator our income could be adversely affected if our tenant consolidate their operation exit the telecommunication business or share site infrastructure to significant degree our growth revenue and ability to generate positive cash flow could be materially and adversely affected significant consolidation among our tenant could reduce demand for our communication infrastructure and may materially and adversely affect our growth and revenue certain combined company have rationalized duplicative part of their network or modernized their network and these and other tenant could determine not to renew or attempt to cancel avoid or limit lease with or related payment in the event tenant terminates it business or separately sell it spectrum of contentswe may experience increased churn result our ongoing contractual revenue and our future result may be negatively impacted if significant number of these lease are terminated or not renewed in addition extensive sharing of site infrastructure roaming or resale arrangement among wireless service provider an alternative to leasing our communication site without compensation to may cause new lease activity to slow if carrier utilize shared equipment rather than deploy new equipment or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain existing site because portion of the tenant network may become redundant our business is subject to government and tax regulation and change in current or future law or regulation could restrict our ability to operate our business we currently do our business and that of our tenant are subject to federal state local and foreign regulation in certain jurisdiction these regulation could be applied or enforced retroactively which could require that we modify or dismantle existing tower at significant cost zoning authority and community organization are often opposed to the construction of communication site in their community which can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction modification addition of new antenna to site or site upgrade thereby limiting our ability to respond to tenant demand existing regulatory policy may materially and adversely affect the timing or cost of construction project associated with our communication site and new regulation may be adopted that increase delay or result in additional cost to or that prevent such project in certain location and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fine or an award of damage to private litigant in certain jurisdiction there may be change to zoning regulation or construction law based on site location which may result in increased cost to modify certain of our existing tower or decreased revenue due to the removal of certain tower to ensure compliance with such change in addition in certain jurisdiction we are required to pay annual license fee which may be subject to substantial increase by the government or new fee may be enacted and applied retroactively governmental license may also be subject to periodic renewal furthermore the tax law regulation and interpretation governing our business in jurisdiction where we operate may change at any time potentially with retroactive effect this includes potential or actual change in tax law or the interpretation of tax law arising of tax authority in addition some of these change could have more significant impact on reit relative to other reit due to the nature of our business and our use of trss these factor could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition our foreign operation are subject to economic political and other risk that could materially and adversely affect our revenue or financial position including risk associated with fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate our international business operation and our expansion into new market in the future expose to potential adverse financial and operational problem not typically experienced in the united state we anticipate that revenue from our international operation will continue to grow accordingly our business is subject to risk associated with business internationally including uncertain inconsistent or changing law regulation ruling or methodology impacting our existing and anticipated international operation fee or other requirement directed specifically at the ownership and operation of communication site or our international acquisition any of which law fee or requirement may be applied retroactively or with significant delay or failure to obtain an expected tax status for which we have applied expropriation or governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture law or regulation that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other fund or otherwise limit distribution of capital change in specific country or region political or economic condition including inflation or currency devaluation change to zoning regulation or construction law which could be applied retroactively to our existing communication site action restricting or revoking our tenant spectrum license or suspending or terminating business under prior license failure to comply with anti bribery law such the foreign corrupt practice act or similar local anti bribery law or the office of foreign asset control requirement failure to comply with data privacy law and other protection of health and employee information material site issue related to security fuel availability and reliability of electrical grid significant increase in or implementation of new license surcharge on our revenue loss of key personnel including expatriate in market where talent is difficult or expensive to acquire and price setting or other similar law or regulation for the sharing of passive infrastructure we also face risk associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate including those arising from our operation investment and financing transaction related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange of contentsrates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operation and expansion effort our revenue earned from our international operation are primarily denominated in their respective local currency we have not historically engaged in significant currency hedging activity relating to our non dollar operation and weakening of these foreign currency the dollar would negatively impact our reported revenue operating profit and income in addition we continue to invest in joint venture opportunity internationally our partner may have business or economic goal that are inconsistent or conflict with ours be in position to take action contrary to our interest policy or objective have competing interest in our or other market that could create conflict of interest issue withhold consent contrary to our request or become unable or unwilling to fulfill their commitment any of which could expose to additional liability or cost including requiring to assume and fulfill the obligation of that joint venture or to execute buyout of their interest substantial portion of our revenue is derived from small number of tenant and we are sensitive to change in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenant substantial portion of our total operating revenue is derived from small number of tenant if any of these tenant is unwilling or unable to perform it obligation under their agreement with our revenue result of operation financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected in the ordinary course of our business we do occasionally experience dispute with our tenant generally regarding the interpretation of term in our lease historically we have resolved these dispute in manner that not have material adverse effect on or our tenant relationship however it is possible that such dispute could lead to termination of our lease with tenant material modification of the term of those lease deterioration in our relationship with those tenant that lead to failure to obtain new business from any of which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition if we are forced to resolve any of these dispute through litigation our relationship with the applicable tenant could be terminated or damaged which could lead to decreased revenue or increased cost resulting in corresponding adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition due to the long term nature of our tenant lease we depend on the continued financial strength of our tenant many wireless service provider operate with substantial level of debt sometimes our tenant or their parent company face financial difficulty file for bankruptcy or terminate operation in our international operation many of our tenant are subsidiary of global telecommunication company these subsidiary may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entity in addition many of our tenant and potential tenant rely on capital raising activity to fund their operation and capital expenditure which may be more difficult or expensive in the event of downturn in the economy or disruption in the financial and credit market if our tenant or potential tenant are unable to raise adequate capital to fund their business plan or face capital constraint they may reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our communication site and our service business if result of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise one or more of our tenant experience financial difficulty or file for bankruptcy it could result in uncollectible account receivable and an impairment of our deferred rent asset tower asset network location intangible asset tenant related intangible asset or goodwill the loss of significant tenant or the loss of all or portion of our anticipated lease revenue from certain tenant could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition our expansion initiative involve number of risk and uncertainty including those related to integrating acquired or leased asset that could adversely affect our operating result disrupt our operation or expose to additional risk we continue to acquire communication site in our existing market and expand into new market we are subject to number of risk and uncertainty including not meeting our return on investment criterion and financial objective increased cost assumed liability and the diversion of managerial attention due to acquisition achieving the benefit of acquisition depends in part on timely and efficient integration of operation telecommunication infrastructure asset and personnel integration may be difficult and unpredictable for many reason including among other thing portfolio without requisite permit differing system cultural difference and conflicting policy procedure and operation significant acquisition related integration cost including certain nonrecurring charge such cost associated with onboarding employee and visiting and upgrading tower site could materially and adversely affect our result of operation in the period in which such charge are recorded or our cash flow in the period in which any related cost are actually paid in addition integration may significantly burden management and internal resource including through the potential loss or unavailability of key personnel if we fail to successfully integrate the asset we acquire or fail to utilize such asset to their full capacity we may not realize the benefit we expect from our acquired portfolio and our business financial condition and result of operation will be adversely affected our international expansion initiative are subject to additional risk such those described in the preceding risk factor of contentsas result of acquisition we have substantial amount of intangible asset and goodwill in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state gaap we are required to ass our goodwill and other intangible asset annually or more frequently in the event of circumstance indicating potential impairment to determine if they are impaired if result of the factor noted the testing performed indicates that an asset may not be recoverable we are required to record non cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible asset and the implied fair value of the goodwill or the estimated fair value of other intangible asset in the period the determination is made our expansion initiative may not be successful or we may be required to record impairment charge for our goodwill or for other intangible asset which could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition competition for asset could adversely affect our ability to achieve our return on investment criterion we may experience increased competition for the acquisition of asset or contract to build new communication site for tenant which could make the acquisition of high quality asset significantly more costly or prohibitive or cause to lose contract to build new site some of our competitor are larger and may have greater financial resource than we do while other competitor may apply le stringent investment criterion than we do in addition we may not anticipate increased competition entering particular market or competing for the asset higher price for asset or the failure to add new asset to our portfolio could make it more difficult to achieve our anticipated return on investment or future growth which could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation or financial condition new technology or change in tenant business model could make our tower leasing business le desirable and result in decreasing revenue and operating result the development and implementation of new technology designed to enhance the efficiency of wireless network or change in tenant business model could reduce the need for tower based wireless service decrease demand for tower space or reduce previously obtainable lease rate in addition tenant may allocate le of their budget to leasing space on our tower the industry is trending towards deploying increased capital to the development and implementation of new technology example of these technology include spectrally efficient technology which could relieve portion of our tenant network capacity need and result could reduce the demand for tower based antenna space additionally certain small cell complementary network technology could shift portion of our tenant network investment away from the traditional tower based network which may reduce the need for carrier to add more equipment at certain communication site moreover the emergence of alternative technology could reduce the need for tower based broadcast service transmission and reception further tenant may decide to cease outsourcing tower infrastructure or otherwise change it business model which would result in decrease in our revenue and operating result our failure to innovate in response to the development and implementation of these or other new technology or change in tenant business model could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation or financial condition conversely we may invest significant capital in technology and innovation project that may not provide expected return or profitability which could divert management attention and have material adverse effect on our operating result our leverage and debt service obligation may materially and adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing to fund capital expenditure future growth and expansion initiative and to satisfy our distribution requirement our leverage and debt service obligation could have significant negative consequence to our business result of operation or financial condition including requiring the dedication of substantial portion of our cash flow from operation to service our debt thereby reducing the amount of our cash flow available for other purpose including capital expenditure reit distribution and preferred stock dividend impairing our ability to meet one or more of the financial ratio covenant contained in our debt agreement or to generate cash sufficient to pay interest or principal due under those agreement which could result in an acceleration of some or all of our outstanding debt and the loss of the tower securing such debt if default remains uncured limiting our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing thereby placing at possible competitive disadvantage to le leveraged competitor and competitor that may have better access to capital resource including with respect to acquiring asset and limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and the market in which we compete of contentswe may need to raise additional capital through debt financing activity asset sale or equity issuance even if the prevailing market condition are not favorable to fund capital expenditure future growth and expansion initiative and to satisfy our distribution requirement and debt service obligation an increase in our total leverage could lead to downgrade of our credit rating below investment grade which could negatively impact our ability to access credit market or preclude from obtaining fund on investment grade term rate and condition or subject to additional loan covenant further certain of our current debt instrument limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiary may incur additional financing therefore may be unavailable more expensive or restricted by the term of our outstanding indebtedness if we fail to remain qualified for taxation reit we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rate which may substantially reduce fund otherwise available and even if we qualify for taxation reit we may face tax liability that impact earnings and available cash flow commencing with the taxable year beginning january we have operated reit for federal income tax purpose qualification for taxation reit requires the application of certain highly technical and complex provision of the internal revenue code of amended the code which provision may change from time to time to our operation well various factual determination concerning matter and circumstance not entirely within our control further tax legislation may adversely affect our ability to remain qualified for taxation reit or the benefit or desirability of remaining so qualified there are judicial or administrative interpretation of the relevant provision of the code if in any taxable year we fail to qualify for taxation reit and are not entitled to relief under the code we will not be allowed deduction for distribution to stockholder in computing our taxable income we will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rate and we will be disqualified from reit tax treatment for the four taxable year immediately following the year during which we were so disqualified on december legislation commonly referred to the tax cut and job act the tax act wa signed into law the tax act make significant change to the code including number of provision that affect the taxation of reit of global corporation and of their stockholder among the change made by the tax act are substantial change to the taxation of international income we believe that certain consequence of some of these change to reit with global operation were unintended nevertheless absent legislative or administrative relief with respect to these consequence we will recognize income on account of the activity of our foreign trss that will not be treated qualifying income for purpose of the reit gross income test that we are required to satisfy or we may be subject to additional income tax or operational cost result thereof we are subject to certain federal state local and foreign tax on our income and asset including tax on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer tax while state and local income tax regime often parallel the federal income tax regime for reit many of these jurisdiction do not completely follow federal rule and some may not follow them at all for example some state and local jurisdiction currently or in the future may limit or eliminate reit deduction for dividend paid which could increase our income tax expense we are also subject to the continual examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service and state local and foreign tax authority the result of an audit and examination of previously filed tax return and continuing assessment of our tax exposure may have an adverse effect on our provision for income tax and cash tax liability our domestic trs asset and operation are subject applicable to federal and state corporation income tax our foreign operation whether in the reit or trss are subject to foreign tax in jurisdiction in which those asset and operation are located any corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purpose if we fail to qualify for taxation reit we may need to borrow additional fund or liquidate some investment to pay any additional tax liability accordingly fund available for investment operation and distribution would be reduced furthermore we have owned and may from time to time own direct and indirect ownership interest in subsidiary reit when we own interest in subsidiary reit we must demonstrate that such subsidiary reit complies with the same reit requirement that we must satisfy together with all other rule applicable to reit if the subsidiary reit is determined to have failed to qualify reit and certain relief provision do not apply then the subsidiary reit would be subject to federal income tax which tax we would economically bear along with applicable penalty and interest in addition our ownership of of contentsshares in such subsidiary reit would fail to be qualifying asset for purpose of the asset test applicable to reit and any dividend income or gain derived by from such subsidiary reit may cease to be treated income that qualifies for purpose of the gross income test these consequence could have material adverse effect on our ability to comply with the reit income and asset test and thus our ability to qualify reit complying with reit requirement may limit our flexibility or cause to forego otherwise attractive opportunity our use of trss enables to engage in non reit qualifying business activity under the code no more than of the value of the asset of reit may be represented by security of one or more trss and other non qualifying asset this limitation may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investment including the purchase of non qualifying asset the expansion of non real estate activity and investment in the business to be conducted by our trss and to that extent limit our opportunity and our flexibility to change our business strategy specifically this limitation may affect our ability to make additional investment in our managed network business or service segment currently structured and operated in other non reit qualifying operation or asset or in international operation conducted through trss that we do not elect to bring into the reit structure further acquisition opportunity in the united state and international market may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirement prior to closing further reit we must distribute to our stockholder an amount equal to at least of the reit taxable income determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain to meet our annual distribution requirement we may be required to distribute amount that may otherwise be used for our operation including amount that may otherwise be invested in future acquisition capital expenditure or repayment of debt no more than of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our trss and other non qualifying type of income our ability to receive distribution from our trss may be limited which may impact our ability to fund distribution to our stockholder or to use income of our trss to fund other investment in addition the majority of our income and cash flow from our trss are generated from our international operation in many case there are local withholding tax and currency control that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate fund to the united state to help satisfy reit distribution requirement restrictive covenant in the agreement related to our securitization transaction our credit facility and our debt security could materially and adversely affect our business by limiting flexibility and we may be prohibited from paying dividend on our common stock which may jeopardize our qualification for taxation reit the agreement related to our securitization transaction include operating covenant and other restriction customary for loan subject to rated securitizations among other thing the borrower under the agreement are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their asset failure to comply with the covenant in the agreement could prevent the borrower from taking certain action with respect to the secured asset and could prevent the borrower from distributing any excess cash from the operation of such asset to if the borrower were to default on any of the loan the servicer on such loan could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the secured asset in which case we could lose such asset and the cash flow associated with such asset we enter into hedge for certain debt instrument these hedge may have an adverse impact on our result to the extent that the counterparties do not perform expected at the inception of each hedge the agreement for our credit facility also contain restrictive covenant and leverage and other financial maintenance test that could limit our ability to take various action including incurring additional debt guaranteeing indebtedness or making distribution to stockholder including our required reit distribution and engaging in various type of transaction including merger acquisition and sale of asset additionally our debt agreement restrict our and our subsidiary ability to incur lien securing our or their indebtedness these covenant could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisition or other opportunity further reporting and information covenant in our credit agreement and indenture require that we provide financial and operating information within certain time period if we are unable to provide the required information on timely basis we would be in breach of these covenant for more information

collapse for any number of reason including structural deficiency which could harm our reputation and require to incur cost for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage our cost could increase and our revenue could decrease due to perceived health risk from radio emission especially if these perceived risk are substantiated public perception of possible health risk associated with cellular and other wireless communication technology could slow the growth of wireless company which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulation regarding these perceived health risk could undermine the market acceptance of wireless communication service and increase opposition to the development and expansion of tower site if scientific study court decision or government agency ruling resulted in finding that radio frequency emission pose health risk to consumer it could negatively impact our tenant and the market for wireless service which

policy and estimate below we report our result in five segment property asia property emea property latin america property and service in evaluating financial performance in each business segment management us among other factor segment gross margin and segment operating profit see note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report executive overviewwe are one of the largest global reit and leading independent owner operator and developer of multitenant communication real estate our primary business is the leasing of space on communication site to wireless service provider radio and television broadcast company wireless data provider government agency and municipality and tenant in number of other industry in addition to the communication site in our portfolio we manage rooftop and tower site for property owner under various contractual arrangement we also hold other telecommunication infrastructure and property interest that we lease to communication service provider and third party tower operator we refer to this business our property operation which accounted for of our total revenue for the year ended december and includes our property segment asia property segment emea property segment and latin america property segment we also offer tower related service in the united state including site acquisition zoning and permitting and structural analysis which primarily support our site leasing business including the addition of new tenant and equipment on our site of contentsthe following table detail the number of communication site excluding managed site that we owned or operated of december number ofowned tower number ofoperated tower number ofowned da sitesdomestic united state india france ghana south africa uganda emea total america argentina rica peru latin america total approximately of the operated tower are held pursuant to long term capital lease including those subject to purchase option in south africa we also own fiber in argentina we also own or operate urban telecommunication asset fiber and the right to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunication equipment installation in mexico we also own or operate urban telecommunication asset including fiber concrete pole and other infrastructure in most of our market our tenant lease with wireless carrier have an initial non cancellable term of at least ten year with multiple renewal term accordingly the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operation during the year ended december wa recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future period based upon foreign currency exchange rate and the tenant lease in place of december we expect to generate over billion of non cancellable tenant lease revenue over future period before the impact of straight line lease accounting most of our tenant lease have provision that periodically increase the rent due under the lease typically based on an annual fixed escalation averaging approximately in the united state or an inflationary index in our international market or combination of both in addition certain of our tenant lease provide for additional revenue primarily to cover cost such ground rent or power and fuel cost the revenue generated by our property operation may be affected by cancellation of existing tenant lease discussed above most of our tenant lease with wireless carrier and broadcaster are multiyear contract which typically are non cancellable however in some instance lease may be cancelled upon the payment of termination fee revenue lost from either cancellation or the non renewal of lease or rent renegotiations historically ha not had material adverse effect on the revenue generated by our property operation this wa the case during the year ended december in which loss of tenant billing from tenant lease cancellation non renewal or renegotiations represented approximately of our tenant billing we do anticipate an increase in revenue lost from cancellation or non renewal in primarily due to carrier consolidation driven churn in asia which is likely to result in modestly higher impact on our revenue including tenant billing compared to the historical average of contentsproperty operation revenue growth due to our diversified communication site portfolio our tenant lease rate vary considerably depending upon numerous factor including but not limited to amount type and position of tenant equipment on the tower remaining tower capacity and tower location we measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factor including tower height tower type environmental condition existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulation in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located in many instance tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditure the primary factor affecting the revenue growth of our property segment are growth in tenant billing including new revenue attributable to lease in place on day one on site acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior year period new revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our site colocations and lease amendment and contractual rent escalation on existing tenant lease net of churn revenue growth from other item including additional tenant payment primarily to cover cost such ground rent or power and fuel cost included in certain tenant lease pas through straight line revenue and decommissioning we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless service globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communication real estate by adding new tenant and new equipment for existing tenant on our site we are able to increase these site utilization and profitability we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service provider with tenant in number of other industry contributing incremental leasing demand our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide with new business opportunity which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth wireless carrier seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing network while also deploying next generation wireless technology in addition we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new site in our existing and new market where we can achieve our risk adjusted return on investment objective property operation organic revenue growth consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our site our objective is to add new tenant and new equipment for existing tenant through colocation and lease amendment our ability to lease additional space on our site is primarily function of the rate at which wireless carrier and other tenant deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless network this rate in turn is influenced by the growth of wireless service the penetration of advanced wireless device the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition the financial performance of our tenant and their access to capital and general economic condition based on industry research and projection we expect that number of key industry trend will result in incremental revenue opportunity for in le advanced wireless market where initial voice and data network are still being deployed we expect these deployment to drive demand for our tower space carrier seek to expand their footprint and increase the scope and density of their network we have established operation in many of these market at the early stage of wireless development which we believe will enable to meaningfully participate in these deployment over the long term subscriber use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration the proliferation of bandwidth intensive application on these device and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem we believe carrier will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing network while also rolling out more advanced wireless network to address coverage and capacity need resulting from this increasing mobile data usage the deployment of advanced mobile technology across existing wireless network will provide higher speed data service and further enable fixed broadband substitution result we expect that our tenant will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing network wireless service provider compete based on the quality of their existing network which is driven by capacity and coverage to maintain or improve their network performance overall network usage increase our tenant continue deploying additional equipment across their existing site while also adding new cell site we anticipate increasing network densification over the next several year existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing level of wireless data usage of content wireless service provider continue to acquire additional spectrum and result are expected to add additional site and equipment to their network they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum next generation technology centered on wireless connection have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunity for these technology may include autonomous vehicle network and number of other internet of thing or iot application well other potential use case for wireless service part of our international expansion initiative we have targeted market in various stage of network development to diversify our international exposure and position to benefit from number of different wireless technology deployment over the long term in addition we have focused on building relationship with large multinational carrier such bharti airtel limited telefónica and vodafone group plc among others we believe that consistent carrier network investment across our international market position to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward in emerging market such ghana india nigeria and uganda wireless network tend to be significantly le advanced than those in the united state and initial voice network continue to be deployed in underdeveloped area majority of consumer in these market still utilize basic wireless service predominantly on feature phone while advanced device penetration remains low in more developed urban location within these market data network deployment are underway carrier are focused on completing voice network build out while also investing in initial data network mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer base begin to accelerate in india the ongoing transition from technology to technology ha included and is expected to continue to include period of carrier consolidation over the next several year whereby the number of carrier operating in the marketplace will be reduced through merger acquisition and select carrier exit from the marketplace over the long term this consolidation process is expected to result in more favorable structural environment for both the wireless carrier well communication infrastructure provider in the shorter term the consolidation process ha resulted and is likely to further result in elevated level of churn within our india business certain component of the combined carrier network and carrier exit are decommissioned to allow for more robust deployment in the future in market with rapidly evolving network technology such south africa and most of the country in latin america where we do business initial voice network for the most part have already been built out and carrier are focused on and network build out consumer in these region are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced device and result the usage of bandwidth intensive mobile application is growing materially recent spectrum auction in these rapidly evolving market have allowed incumbent carrier to accelerate their data network deployment and have also enabled new entrant to begin initial investment in data network smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these market are advancing rapidly which typically requires that carrier continue to invest in their network to maintain and augment their quality of service finally in market with more mature network technology such germany and france carrier are focused on deploying data network to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base with higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per caput data usage carrier investment in network is focused on coverage and capacity we believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the united state which ha led to significantly denser network and meaningful new business commencement for over number of year will ultimately be replicated in our le advanced international market result we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately communication site and the relationship we have built with our carrier tenant to drive sustainable long term growth we have master lease agreement with certain of our tenant that provide for consistent long term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn certain of those master lease agreement are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnership with our tenant and have significantly reduced colocation cycle time thereby providing our tenant with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our site property operation new site revenue growth during the year ended december we grew our portfolio of communication real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately site globally well the acquisition of certain urban telecommunication asset in mexico in majority of our asia emea and latin america market the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed site resulted in increase in both tenant and pas through revenue such ground rent or power and fuel cost and expense we continue to evaluate opportunity to acquire communication of contentsreal estate portfolio both domestically and internationally to determine whether they meet our risk adjusted hurdle rate and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio new site acquired or constructed operation expense direct operating expense incurred by our property segment include direct site level expense and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel cost some or all of which may be passed through to our tenant well property tax repair and maintenance these segment direct operating expense exclude all segment and corporate selling general administrative and development expense which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling general administrative and development expense in our consolidated statement of operation in general our property segment selling general administrative and development expense do not significantly increase result of adding incremental tenant to our site and typically increase only modestly year over year result leasing additional space to new tenant on our site provides significant incremental cash flow we may however incur additional segment selling general administrative and development expense we increase our presence in our existing market or expand into new market our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenant to our site but can be temporarily diluted by our development activity service segment revenue growth we continue to focus on growing our property operation we anticipate that our service revenue will continue to represent small percentage of our total revenue non gaap financial

of these item and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlement we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such change if any to previously recorded uncertain tax position off balance sheet arrangement we have no material off balance sheet arrangement defined in item ii of sec regulation factor affecting source of liquidity our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activity borrow fund under our credit facility and maintain compliance with the contractual agreement governing our indebtedness we believe that the debt agreement discussed below represent our material debt agreement that contain covenant our compliance with which would be material to an investor understanding of our financial result and the impact of those result on our liquidity internally generated fund because the majority of our tenant lease are multiyear contract significant majority of the revenue generated by our property operation of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future period accordingly key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activity is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating cost and fully achieving our operating efficiency in addition our ability to increase cash flow from operating activity depends upon the demand for our communication site and our related service and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communication site restriction under loan agreement relating to our credit facility the loan agreement for the credit facility the credit facility and the term loan contain certain financial and operating covenant and other restriction applicable to and our subsidiary that are not designated unrestricted subsidiary on consolidated basis these restriction include limitation on additional debt distribution and dividend guaranty sale of asset and lien the loan agreement also contain covenant that establish financial test with which we and our restricted subsidiary must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage

capacity for adjusted ebitda decrease under covenant consolidated total leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda senior secured leverage ratio senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda _______________ each component of the ratio defined in the applicable loan agreement assumes no change to adjusted ebitda assumes no change to our debt level effectively however additional senior secured debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the consolidated total leverage ratio the loan agreement for our credit facility also contain reporting and information covenant that require to provide financial and operating information to the lender within certain time period if we are unable to provide the required information on timely basis we would be in breach of these covenant of contentsfailure to comply with the financial maintenance test and certain other covenant of the loan agreement for our credit facility could not only prevent from being able to borrow additional fund under these credit facility but may constitute default under these credit facility which could result in among other thing the amount outstanding including all accrued interest and unpaid fee becoming immediately due and payable if this were to occur we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness the key factor affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenant described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance test defined in the loan agreement for these credit facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligation based upon our current expectation we believe our operating result during the next month will be sufficient to comply with these covenant restriction under agreement relating to the

it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital we may be unable to do so or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the term of our outstanding indebtedness if we are unable to raise capital when our need arise we may not be able to fund capital expenditure future growth and expansion initiative satisfy our reit distribution requirement and debt service obligation pay preferred stock dividend or refinance our existing indebtedness in addition our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activity set forth under item of this annual report under the caption risk factor we derive substantial portion of our revenue from small number of tenant and consequently failure by significant tenant to perform it contractual obligation to could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity critical accounting policy and estimatesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense well related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we evaluate our policy and estimate on an ongoing basis management base it estimate on historical experience and various other assumption that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we have reviewed our policy and estimate to determine our critical accounting policy for the year ended december we have identified the following policy critical to an understanding of our result of operation and financial condition this is not comprehensive list of our accounting policy see note to our consolidated financial statement included in this annual report for summary of our significant accounting policy in many case the accounting treatment of particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap with no need for management judgment in it application there are also area in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce materially different result impairment of asset asset subject to depreciation and amortization we review long lived asset for impairment at least annually or whenever event change in circumstance or other indicator or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our asset may not be recoverable of contentswe review our tower portfolio and network location intangible asset for indicator of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flow typically at an individual tower basis possible indicator include tower not having current tenant lease or having expense in excess of revenue cash flow modeling approach is utilized to ass recoverability and incorporates among other item the tower location the tower location demographic the timing of addition of new tenant lease rate and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirement we review our tenant related intangible asset on tenant by tenant basis for indicator of impairment such high level of turnover or attrition non renewal of significant number of contract or the cancellation or termination of relationship we ass recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant related intangible asset will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flow if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of our long lived asset is le than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss may be recognized an impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flow to be provided from the asset we record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment in october one of our tenant in asia tata teleservices informed the department of telecommunication in india of it intent to exit the wireless telecommunication business and announced plan to transfer it business to another telecommunication provider we considered these recent development regarding these event when conducting our annual impairment test for the tata teleservices tenant relationship which did not result in an impairment since the estimated probability weighted undiscounted cash flow were in excess of the carrying value of this asset by approximately million or key assumption included in the undiscounted cash flow were future revenue projection estimate of ongoing tenancy operating margin and the probability weighting assigned to the future cash flow scenario for this tenant relationship intangible asset we performed sensitivity analysis on our significant assumption and determined that reduction on projected cash flow which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusion that the undiscounted future cash flow to be generated from the tenant relationship exceeds it carrying value we will continue to monitor the status of these development it is possible that the estimated future cash flow may differ from current estimate and change in estimated cash flow from tata teleservices could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible asset including amount originally recorded tenant related intangible which have current net book value of million impairment of asset goodwill we review goodwill for impairment at least annually of december or whenever event or circumstance indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level we utilize the two step impairment test and employ discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment the key assumption utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance terminal sale growth rate management expectation of future operating result and cash requirement the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate under the first step of this test we compare the fair value of the reporting unit calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flow to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value we conduct the second step of this test in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds it implied fair value an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess during the year ended december no potential impairment wa identified the fair value of each of our reporting unit wa in excess of it carrying amount the fair value of our india reporting unit which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flow the income approach exceeded the carrying value by approximately million or result of the telecommunication carrier consolidation occurring in the india market we lowered our discounted cash flow projection which increase the sensitivity of these projection to change in the key assumption used in determining the fair value of the india reporting unit of december key assumption include future revenue growth rate and operating margin capital expenditure terminal period growth rate and the weighted average cost of capital which were determined considering historical data and current assumption related to the impact of the carrier consolidation of contentsfor this reporting unit we performed sensitivity analysis on our significant assumption and determined that reduction on projected revenue ii basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital or iii reduction in terminal sale growth rate individually each of which we determined to be reasonable would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the india reporting unit exceeds it carrying value event that could negatively affect our india reporting unit financial result include increased customer attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation carrier tenant bankruptcy and other factor set forth in item of this annual report under the caption risk factor the carrying value of goodwill in the india reporting unit wa million of december which represents of our consolidated balance of million asset retirement obligation when required we recognize the fair value of obligation to remove our tower asset and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower asset are located generally the associated retirement cost are capitalized part of the carrying amount of the related tower asset and depreciated over their estimated useful life and the liability is accreted through the obligation estimated settlement date we updated our assumption used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation which resulted in net increase in the estimated obligation of million during the year ended december the change in primarily resulted from change in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumption fair value estimate of liability for asset retirement obligation generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flow periodic accretion of such liability due to the passage of time is included in depreciation amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statement of operation the significant assumption used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removal cost of tower removal timing and number of land lease renewal expected inflation rate and credit adjusted risk free interest rate that approximate our incremental borrowing rate while we feel the assumption are appropriate there can be no assurance that actual cost and the probability of incurring obligation will not differ from these estimate we will continue to review these assumption periodically and we may need to adjust them necessary acquisition we evaluate each of our acquisition under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition an asset acquisition or business combination for those transaction treated asset acquisition the purchase price is allocated to the asset acquired with no recognition of goodwill for those acquisition that meet the definition of business combination we apply the acquisition method of accounting where asset acquired and liability assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and the result of operation are included with our result from the date of the respective acquisition any excess of the purchase price paid over the amount recognized for asset acquired and liability assumed is recorded goodwill we continue to evaluate acquisition for period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustment are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the asset acquired and liability assumed the fair value of the asset acquired and liability assumed is typically determined by using either estimate of replacement cost or discounted cash flow valuation method when determining the fair value of tangible asset acquired we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with new asset taking into consideration such factor age condition and the economic useful life of the asset when determining the fair value of intangible asset acquired we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flow including rate and term of renewal and attrition revenue recognition our revenue from leasing arrangement including fixed escalation clause present in non cancellable lease arrangement is reported on straight line basis over the term of the respective lease when collectibility is reasonably assured escalation clause tied to the consumer price index or other inflation based index and other incentive present in lease agreement with our tenant are excluded from the straight line calculation total property straight line revenue for the year ended december and were million million and million respectively amount billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreement are initially deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and recognized revenue over the term of the applicable lease amount billed or received for service prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet until the criterion for recognition have been met we derive the largest portion of our revenue corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from small number of tenant in the telecommunication industry with of our revenue derived from four tenant in addition we have concentration of credit risk in certain geographic area we mitigate the concentration of credit risk with respect to note and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrower and of contentstenants in recognizing tenant revenue we ass the collectibility of both the amount billed and the portion recognized on straight line basis this assessment take tenant credit risk and business and industry condition into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amount billed to the extent the amount based on management estimate may not be collectible recognition is deferred until such point the uncertainty is resolved any amount that were previously recognized revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense account receivable are reported net of allowance for doubtful account related to estimated loss resulting from tenant inability to make required payment and allowance for amount invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured rent expense many of the lease underlying our tower site have fixed rent escalation which provide for periodic increase in the amount of ground rent payable over time in addition certain of our tenant lease require to exercise available renewal option pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercise it renewal option we calculate straight line ground rent expense for these lease based on the fixed non cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all period if any for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured income tax accounting for income tax requires to estimate the timing and impact of amount recorded in our financial statement that may be recognized differently for tax purpose to the extent that the timing of amount recognized for financial reporting purpose differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purpose deferred tax asset or liability are required to be recorded deferred tax asset and liability are measured based on the rate at which we expect these item to be reflected in our tax return which may differ from the current rate we do not expect to pay federal tax on our reit taxable income we periodically review our deferred tax asset and we record valuation allowance if based on the available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized management ass the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be reversed reduction to the provision for income tax if related deferred tax asset are deemed realizable based on change in fact and circumstance relevant to the asset recoverability we recognize the benefit of uncertain tax position when in management judgment it is more likely than not that position we have taken in our tax return will be sustained upon examination which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement we adjust our tax liability when our judgment change result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available due to the complexity of some of these uncertainty the ultimate resolution may result in payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liability these difference will be reflected increase or decrease to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the
