allowance available for purchase at auction ccr trigger price are in in and in after the ccr price increase by percent each year such an outcome could put modest upward pressure on wholesale power price however the specific are currently uncertain at the state level the illinois climate change advisory group created by executive order on october made it final recommendation on september to meet the governor ghg reduction goal at this time the only requirement imposed by the state of illinois are the energy efficiency and renewable portfolio standard in the illinois power act that apply to comed on december pennsylvania issued the state final climate change action plan the plan set target percent reduction in ghg emission by the climate change advisory committee continues to meet quarterly to review climate action work plan for the residential commercial and industrial sector the climate change action plan doe not impose any requirement on generation or peco at this time the maryland commission on climate change wa chartered in and released greenhouse gas reduction strategy with recommendation on august the plan primary policy recommendation to formally adopt science based regulatory goal to reduce maryland ghg emission wa realized with the passage of the greenhouse gas emission reduction act of ggra which requires maryland to reduce it ghg emission by percent below level by it also directed the maryland department of environment to prepare and implement an action plan which wa published in october of maryland electricity consumption reduction goal required under the empower maryland program and mandatory state participation in rggi program are listed the energy sector contribution in the plan the plan also advocated raising the renewable portfolio standard requirement from by to by the department of environment wa required to submit december report to the governor and general assembly table of content on progress towards the mandate it cost and benefit the need for target adjustment and the status of federal program in the legislature will review the progress report it economic impact on manufacturing sector and other information and determine whether to continue adjust or eliminate the requirement to achieve reduction by exelon voluntary climate change effort in world increasingly concerned about global climate change and

alternative energy portfolio standard thirty nine state and the district of columbia have adopted some form of rps requirement illinois pennsylvania and maryland have law specifically addressing energy efficiency and renewable energy initiative in addition to state level activity rps legislation ha been considered and may be considered in the future by the united state congress also state that currently do not have rps requirement may adopt such legislation in the future illinois utility are required to procure cost effective renewable energy resource in amount that equal or exceed of the total electricity that each electric utility supply to it eligible retail customer comed is also required to acquire amount of renewable energy resource to cumulatively increase this percentage to at least by june and an ultimate target of at least by june all goal are subject to rate impact criterion set forth by illinois legislation of december comed had purchased sufficient renewable energy resource or equivalent such recs to comply with the illinois legislation comed currently retires all recs upon transfer and acceptance comed is permitted to recover procurement cost of recs from retail customer without mark up through rate the aeps act became effective for peco on january during peco wa required to supply approximately of electric energy generated from tier alternative energy resource including solar wind power low impact hydropower geothermal energy biologically derived methane gas fuel cell biomass energy coal mine methane and black liquor generated within pennsylvania measured in aec through may and subsequently beginning june and continuing through may peco wa also required to supply of electric energy generated from tier ii alternative energy resource including waste coal demand side management large scale hydropower municipal solid waste generation of electricity utilizing wood and by product of the pulping process and wood distributed generation system and integrated combined coal gasification technology measured in aec through may and subsequently beginning june and continuing through may the compliance requirement will incrementally escalate to for

ii aec peco also purchase aec through it dsp program full requirement contract section of the public utility article in maryland set forth the rps requirement which applies to all retail electricity sale in maryland by electricity supplier the rps requirement requires that supplier obtain specified percentage of the electricity it sell from tier source solar wind biomass methane geothermal ocean fuel cell small hydroelectric and poultry litter and tier table of content source hydroelectric other than pump storage generation and waste to energy the rps requirement began in requiring that supplier procure and from tier and tier source respectively escalating in to from tier source including at least from solar energy and phase out of tier resource option by in wa required from tier renewable source including at least derived from solar energy and from tier renewable source bge is subject to requirement established by the public utility article in maryland related to the use of alternative energy resource however the wholesale supplier that supply power to bge through so procurement auction have the obligation by contract with bge to meet the rps requirement similar to comed peco and bge generation retail electric business must source portion of the electric load it serf in many of the state in which it doe business from renewable resource or approved equivalent such recs potential regulation and legislation regarding renewable and alternative energy resource could increase the pace of development of wind and other renewable alternative energy resource which could put downward pressure on wholesale market price for electricity in some market where exelon operates generation asset at the time such development may present some opportunity for sale of generation

registrant operates in market and regulatory environment that pose significant risk many of which are beyond that registrant control management of each registrant regularly meet with the chief enterprise risk officer and the rmc which comprises officer of the registrant to identify and evaluate the most significant risk of the registrant business and the appropriate step to manage and mitigate those risk the chief enterprise risk officer and senior executive of the registrant discus those risk with the finance and risk committee and audit committee of the exelon board of director and the comed peco and bge board of director in addition the table of content generation oversight committee of the exelon board of director evaluates risk related to the generation business the risk factor discussed below could adversely affect one or more of the registrant result of operation or cash flow and the market price of their publicly traded security each of the registrant ha disclosed the known material risk that affect it business at this time however there may be further risk and uncertainty that are not presently known or that are not currently believed by registrant to be material that could adversely affect it performance or financial condition in the future exelon financial condition and result of operation are affected to significant degree by generation position predominantly nuclear generator selling power into competitive energy market with concentration in select region and the role of comed peco and bge operator of electric transmission and distribution system in three of the largest metropolitan area in the united state factor that affect the financial condition and result of operation of the registrant fall primarily under the following category all of which are discussed in further detail below market and financial factor exelon and generation result of operation are affected by price fluctuation in the energy market power price are function of supply and demand which in turn are driven by factor such the price of fuel in particular the price of natural gas which affect the price that generation can obtain for the output of it power plant the presence of other generation resource in the market in which generation output is sold the demand for electricity in the market where the registrant conduct their business and the impact of on going competition in the retail channel regulatory and legislative factor the regulatory and legislative factor that affect the registrant include change to the law and regulation that govern competitive market and utility cost recovery and that drive environmental policy in particular exelon and generation financial performance could be affected by change in the design of competitive wholesale power market or generation ability to sell power in those market in addition potential regulation and legislation including legislation or regulation regarding climate change and renewable portfolio standard could have significant effect on the registrant also return for comed peco and bge are influenced significantly by state regulation and regulatory proceeding operational factor the registrant operational performance is subject to those factor inherent in running the nation largest fleet of nuclear power reactor and large electric and gas distribution system the safe and effective operation of the nuclear facility and the ability to effectively manage the associated decommissioning obligation well the ability to maintain the availability reliability and safety of it energy delivery system are fundamental to exelon ability to protect and grow shareholder value additionally the operating cost of comed peco and bge and the opinion of their customer and regulator are affected by those company ability to maintain the reliability and safety of their energy delivery system risk related to the pending merger with phi there are various risk and uncertainty associated with the merger agreement announced with phi on april discussion of each of these risk category and other risk factor is included below market and financial factor generation is exposed to depressed price in the wholesale and retail power market which could negatively affect it result of operation or cash flow exelon and generation generation is exposed to commodity price risk for the unhedged portion of it electricity generation supply portfolio generation earnings and cash flow are therefore subject to variability spot and forward market price in the market in which it operates rise and fall table of content price of fuel the spot market price of electricity for each hour is generally determined by the marginal cost of supplying the next unit of electricity to the market during that hour thus the market price of power is affected by the market price of the marginal fuel used to generate the electricity unit often the next unit of electricity will be supplied from generating station fueled by fossil fuel consequently change in the market price of fossil fuel often result in comparable change to the market price of power for example the use of new technology to recover natural gas from shale deposit ha increased natural gas supply and reserve placing downward pressure on natural gas price and therefore on power price the continued addition of supply from new alternative generation resource such wind and solar whether mandated through rps or otherwise subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation may displace higher marginal cost plant further reducing power price in addition further delay or elimination of epa air quality regulation could prolong the duration for which the cost of pollution from fossil fuel generation is not factored into market price demand and supply the market price for electricity is also affected by change in the demand for electricity and the available supply of electricity unfavorable economic condition milder than normal weather and the growth of energy efficiency and demand response program could each depress demand the result is that higher cost generating resource do not run frequently putting downward pressure on electricity market price the tepid economic environment in recent year and growing energy efficiency and demand response initiative have limited the demand for electricity in generation market in addition in some market the supply of electricity through wind or solar generation when combined with other base load generation such nuclear could often exceed demand during some hour of the day resulting in loss of revenue for base load generating plant increased supply in excess of demand is furthered by the continuation of rps mandate and subsidy for renewable energy retail competition generation retail operation compete for customer in competitive environment which affect the margin that generation can earn and the volume that it is able to serve in period of sustained low natural gas and power price and low market volatility retail competitor can aggressively pursue market share because the barrier to entry can be low and wholesale generator including generation use their retail operation to hedge generation output increased or more aggressive competition could adversely affect overall gross margin and profitability in generation retail operation sustained low market price or depressed demand and over supply could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation or cash flow and such impact could be emphasized given generation concentration of base load electric generating capacity within primarily two geographic market region namely the midwest and the mid atlantic these impact could adversely affect exelon and generation ability to fund other discretionary us of cash such growth project or to pay dividend in addition such condition may no longer support the continued operation of certain generating facility which could adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation through accelerated depreciation expense impairment charge related to inventory that can not be used at other nuclear unit and cancellation of in flight capital project accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel cost severance cost accelerated asset retirement obligation expense relate to future decommissioning activity and additional funding of decommissioning cost which can be offset in whole or in part by reduced operating and maintenance expense slow recovery in market condition could result in prolonged depression of or further decline in commodity price including low forward natural gas and power price and low market volatility which could also adversely affect exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position see note implication of potential early plant retirement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information table of content in addition to price fluctuation generation is exposed to other risk in the power market that are beyond it control and could negatively affect it result of operation exelon and generation credit risk in the bilateral market generation is exposed to the risk that counterparties that owe generation money or are obligated to purchase energy or fuel from generation will not perform under their obligation for operational or financial reason in the event the counterparties to these arrangement fail to perform generation could be forced to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale market at le favorable price and incur additional loss to the extent of amount if any already paid to the counterparties in the spot market generation is exposed to risk result of default sharing mechanism that exist within certain market primarily rtos and isos the purpose of which is to spread such risk across all market participant generation is also party to agreement with entity in the energy sector that have experienced rating downgrade or other financial difficulty in addition generation retail sale subject it to credit risk through competitive electricity and natural gas supply activity to serve commercial and industrial company governmental entity and residential customer retail credit risk result when customer default on their contractual obligation this risk represents the loss that could be incurred due to the nonpayment of customer account balance well the loss from the resale of energy previously committed to serve the customer market design the wholesale market remain evolving market that vary from region to region and are still developing rule practice and procedure change in these market rule problem with rule implementation or failure of any of these market could adversely affect generation business in addition significant decrease in market participation could affect market liquidity and have detrimental effect on market stability the registrant are potentially affected by emerging technology that could over time affect or transform the energy industry including technology related to energy generation distribution and consumption exelon generation comed peco and bge some of these technology include but are not limited to further shale gas development or source cost effective renewable energy technology broad consumer adoption of electric vehicle distributed generation and energy storage device such development could affect the price of energy could affect energy delivery customer owned generation becomes more cost effective could require further improvement to our distribution system to address changing load demand and could make portion of our electric system power supply and transmission and or distribution facility obsolete prior to the end of their useful life such technology could also result in further decline in commodity price or demand for delivered energy each of these factor could materially affect the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position through among other thing reduced operating revenue increased operating and maintenance expense and increased capital expenditure well potential asset impairment charge or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expense over shortened remaining asset useful life market performance and other factor could decrease the value of ndt fund and employee benefit plan asset and could increase the related employee benefit plan obligation which then could require significant additional funding exelon generation comed peco and bge disruption in the capital market and their actual or perceived effect on particular business and the greater economy could adversely affect the value of the investment held within generation ndts and exelon employee benefit plan trust the registrant have significant obligation in these area and exelon and generation hold substantial asset in these trust to meet those obligation the asset value are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which could fall below the registrant projected return rate decline in the market value of the ndt fund investment could increase generation funding requirement to decommission it nuclear plant decline in the table of content market value of the pension and opeb plan asset will increase the funding requirement associated with exelon pension and opeb plan obligation additionally exelon pension and opeb plan liability are sensitive to change in interest rate interest rate decrease the liability increase potentially increasing benefit cost and funding requirement change in demographic including increased number of retirement or change in life expectancy assumption or change to social security or medicare eligibility requirement could also increase the cost and funding requirement of the obligation related to the pension and opeb plan if future increase in pension and other postretirement cost result of reduced plan asset or other factor can not be recovered or can not be recovered in timely manner from comed peco and bge customer the result of operation and financial position of comed peco and bge could be negatively affected ultimately if the registrant are unable to manage the investment within the ndt fund and benefit plan asset and are unable to manage the related benefit plan liability their result of operation cash flow or financial position could be negatively impacted unstable capital and credit market and increased volatility in commodity market could adversely affect the registrant business in several way including the availability and cost of short term fund for liquidity requirement the registrant ability to meet long term commitment generation ability to hedge effectively it generation portfolio and the competitiveness and liquidity of energy market each could negatively impact the registrant result of operation cash flow or financial position exelon generation comed peco and bge the registrant rely on the capital market particularly for publicly offered debt well the banking and commercial paper market to meet their financial commitment and short term liquidity need if internal fund are not available from the registrant respective operation disruption in the capital and credit market in the united state or abroad could adversely affect the registrant ability to access the capital market or draw on their respective bank revolving credit facility the registrant access to fund under their credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that are party to the facility to meet their funding commitment those bank may not be able to meet their funding commitment to the registrant if they experience shortage of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volume of borrowing request from the registrant and other borrower within short period of time the inability to access capital market or credit facility and longer term disruption in the capital and credit market result of uncertainty changing or increased regulation reduced alternative or failure of significant financial institution could result in the deferral of discretionary capital expenditure change to generation hedging strategy in order to reduce collateral posting requirement or reduction in dividend payment or other discretionary us of cash in addition the registrant have exposure to worldwide financial market including europe disruption in the european market could reduce or restrict the registrant ability to secure sufficient liquidity or secure liquidity at reasonable term of december approximately or billion of the registrant available credit facility were with european bank the credit facility include billion in aggregate total commitment of which billion wa available of december there were no borrowing under the registrant credit facility of december see note debt and credit agreement of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information on the credit facility the strength and depth of competition in energy market depend heavily on active participation by multiple trading party which could be adversely affected by disruption in the capital and credit market and legislative and regulatory initiative that may affect participant in commodity transaction reduced capital and liquidity and failure of significant institution that participate in the energy market could diminish the liquidity and competitiveness of energy market that are important to the respective business of the registrant perceived weakness in the competitive strength of table of content the energy market could lead to pressure for greater regulation of those market or attempt to replace market structure with other mechanism for the sale of power including the requirement of long term contract which could have material adverse effect on exelon and generation result of operation or cash flow if any of the registrant were to experience downgrade in it credit rating to below investment grade or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard in it agreement with it trading counterparties it would be required to provide significant amount of collateral under it agreement with counterparties and could experience higher borrowing cost exelon generation comed peco and bge generation business is subject to credit quality standard that could require market participant to post collateral for their obligation if generation were to be downgraded or lose it investment grade credit rating based on it senior unsecured debt rating or otherwise fail to satisfy the credit standard of trading counterparties it would be required under it hedging arrangement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which may have material adverse effect upon it liquidity the amount of collateral required to be provided by generation at any point in time is dependent on variety of factor including the notional amount of the applicable hedge the nature of counterparty and related agreement and change in power or other commodity price in addition if generation were downgraded it could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade generation could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency concludes that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the power generation industry in general or generation in particular ha deteriorated change in rating methodology by the credit rating agency could also have negative impact on the rating of generation generation ha project specific financing arrangement and must meet the requirement of various agreement relating to those financing failure to meet those arrangement could give rise to project specific financing default which if not cured or waived could result in the specific project being required to repay the associated debt or other borrowing earlier than otherwise anticipated and if such repayment were not made the lender or security holder would generally have right to foreclose the project asset and related collateral comed peco and bge operating agreement with pjm and peco and bge natural gas procurement contract contain collateral provision that are affected by their credit rating and market price if certain wholesale market condition were to exist and comed peco and bge were to lose their investment grade credit rating based on their senior unsecured debt rating they would be required to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which could have material adverse effect upon their liquidity collateral posting requirement will generally increase market price rise and decrease market price fall collateral posting requirement for peco and bge with respect to their natural gas supply contract will generally increase forward market price fall and decrease forward market price rise given the relationship to forward market price contract collateral requirement can be volatile in addition if comed peco and bge were downgraded they could experience higher borrowing cost result of the downgrade comed peco or bge could experience downgrade in it rating if any of the credit rating agency conclude that the level of business or financial risk and overall creditworthiness of the utility industry in general or comed peco or bge in particular ha deteriorated comed peco or bge could experience downgrade if the current regulatory environment in illinois pennsylvania or maryland respectively become le predictable by materially lowering return for utility in the applicable state or adopting other measure to limit electricity price additionally the rating for comed peco or bge could be downgraded if their financial result are weakened from current level due to weaker operating performance or due to failure to properly manage their capital structure in addition change in rating methodology by the agency could also have negative impact on the rating of comed peco or bge table of content comed peco and bge conduct their respective business and operate under governance model and other arrangement and procedure intended to assure that comed peco and bge are treated separate independent company distinct from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in order to isolate comed peco and bge from exelon and other exelon subsidiary in the event of financial difficulty at exelon or another exelon subsidiary these measure commonly referred to ring fencing may help avoid or limit downgrade in the credit rating of comed peco and bge in the event of reduction in the credit rating of exelon despite these ring fencing measure the credit rating of comed peco or bge could remain linked to some degree to the credit rating of exelon consequently reduction in the credit rating of exelon could result in reduction of the credit rating of comed peco or bge or all three reduction in the credit rating of comed peco or bge could have material adverse effect on comed peco or bge respectively see liquidity and capital resource recent market condition and security rating for further information regarding the potential impact of credit downgrade on the registrant cash flow generation financial performance could be negatively affected by price volatility availability and other risk factor associated with the procurement of nuclear and fossil fuel exelon and generation generation depends on nuclear fuel and fossil fuel to operate it generating facility nuclear fuel is obtained predominantly through long term uranium supply contract contracted conversion service contracted enrichment service or combination thereof and contracted fuel fabrication service natural gas and oil are procured for generating plant through annual short term and spot market purchase the supply market for nuclear fuel natural gas and oil are subject to price fluctuation availability restriction and counterparty default that could negatively affect the result of operation or cash flow for generation generation risk management policy can not fully eliminate the risk associated with it commodity trading activity exelon and generation generation asset based power position well it power marketing fuel procurement and other commodity trading activity expose generation to risk of commodity price movement generation attempt to manage this exposure through enforcement of established risk limit and risk management procedure these risk limit and risk management procedure may not work planned and can not eliminate all risk associated with these activity even when it policy and procedure are followed and decision are made based on projection and estimate of future performance result of operation could be diminished if the judgment and assumption underlying those decision prove to be incorrect factor such future price and demand for power and other energy related commodity become more difficult to predict and the calculation become le reliable the further into the future estimate are made result generation can not predict the impact that it commodity trading activity and risk management decision could have on it business operating result cash flow or financial position generation buy and sell energy and other product and enters into financial contract to manage risk and hedge various position in generation power generation portfolio the proportion of hedged position in it power generation portfolio could expose generation to volatility in future result of operation financial performance and load requirement could be adversely affected if generation is unable to effectively manage it power portfolio exelon and generation significant portion of generation power portfolio is used to provide power under procurement contract with comed peco bge and other customer to the extent portion of the power portfolio table of content are not needed for that purpose generation output is sold in the wholesale power market to the extent it power portfolio is not sufficient to meet the requirement of it customer under the related agreement generation must purchase power in the wholesale power market generation financial result could be negatively affected if it is unable to cost effectively meet the load requirement of it customer manage it power portfolio and effectively address the change in the wholesale power market challenge to tax position taken by the registrant well tax law change and the inherent difficulty in quantifying potential tax effect of business decision could negatively impact the registrant result of operation or cash flow exelon generation comed peco and bge corporate tax reform there exists the potential for comprehensive tax reform in the united state that may significantly change the tax rule applicable to domiciled corporation exelon can not ass what the overall effect of such potential legislation could be on it result of operation or cash flow sale of fossil generating asset the irs ha challenged exelon tax position on it like kind exchange transaction exelon and the irs failed to reach settlement on the like kind exchange position and exelon filed petition on december to initiate litigation in the united state tax court and the trial took place in august exelon wa not required to remit any part of the asserted tax or penalty in order to litigate the like kind exchange position the litigation could take three to five year including appeal if necessary of december if the irs is successful in it challenge to the like kind exchange position exelon potential cash outflow including tax and after tax interest exclusive of penalty that could become currently payable may be much million of which approximately million would be attributable to comed after consideration of exelon agreement to hold comed harmless in addition to attempting to impose tax on the like kind exchange position the irs ha asserted

statement for additional information increase in customer rate and the impact of economic downturn could lead to greater expense for uncollectible customer balance additionally increased rate could lead to decreased volume delivered both of these factor could decrease generation comed peco and bge result from operation or cash flow exelon generation comed peco and bge comed peco and bge current procurement plan include purchasing power through contracted supplier and in the spot market comed and peco cost of purchased power are charged to customer without return or profit component bge so rate charged to customer recover bge wholesale power supply cost and include return component for peco purchased natural gas cost are charged to customer with no return or profit component for bge purchased natural gas cost are charged to customer using mbr mechanism that compare the actual cost of gas to market index the difference between the actual cost and the market index is shared equally table of content between shareholder and customer purchased power and natural gas price fluctuate based on their relevant supply and demand significantly higher rate related to purchased power and natural gas could result in decline in customer usage lower revenue and potentially additional uncollectible account expense for comed peco and bge in addition any challenge by the regulator or comed peco and bge to the recoverability of these cost could have material effect on the registrant result of operation or cash flow also comed peco and bge cash flow could be affected by difference between the time period when electricity and natural gas are purchased and the ultimate recovery from customer further the impact of economic downturn on comed peco and bge customer and purchased natural gas cost for peco and bge customer such unemployment for residential customer and le demand for product and service provided by commercial and industrial customer and the related regulatory limitation on residential service termination could result in an increase in the number of uncollectible customer balance which would negatively impact comed peco and bge result of operation or cash flow generation customer facing energy delivery activity face economic downturn risk similar to exelon utility business such lower volume sold and increased expense for uncollectible customer balance generation increase it customer facing energy delivery activity economic downturn impact could negatively affect generation result of operation or cash flow see item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for further discussion of the registrant credit risk the effect of weather could impact the registrant result of operation or cash flow exelon generation comed peco and bge weather condition directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and affect the price of energy commodity temperature above normal level in the summer tend to increase summer cooling electricity demand and revenue and temperature below normal level in the winter tend to increase winter heating electricity and gas demand and revenue moderate temperature adversely affect the usage of energy and resulting revenue at comed and peco due to revenue decoupling bge recognizes revenue at mdpsc approved level per customer regardless of what actual distribution volume are for billing period and is not affected by actual weather with the exception of major storm extreme weather condition or damage resulting from storm could stress comed peco and bge transmission and distribution system communication system and technology resulting in increased maintenance and capital cost and limiting each company ability to meet peak customer demand these extreme condition could have

the ability of comed peco and bge to recover their cost for the retail purchase and distribution of power to their customer table of content similarly there is risk that financial market regulation could increase the registrant compliance cost and limit their ability to engage in certain transaction in the planning and management of operation the registrant must address the effect of regulation on their business and change in the regulatory framework including initiative by federal and state legislature rtos exchange ratemaking agency and taxing authority additionally the registrant need to be cognizant and understand rule change or registrant action that could result in potential violation of tariff market rule and anti manipulation law fundamental change in regulation or other adverse legislative action affecting the registrant business would require change in their business planning model and operation and could negatively impact their result of operation cash flow or financial position regulatory and legislative development related to climate change and rps could also significantly affect exelon and generation result of operation cash flow or financial position various legislative and regulatory proposal to address climate change through ghg emission reduction if enacted could result in increased cost to entity that generate electricity through carbon emitting fossil fuel which could increase the market price at which all generator in region including generation may sell their output thereby increasing the revenue generation could realize from it low carbon nuclear asset however national regulation or legislation addressing climate change through an rps could also increase the pace of development of wind energy facility in the midwest which could put downward pressure on wholesale market price for electricity from generation midwest nuclear asset partially offsetting any additional value exelon and generation might derive from generation nuclear asset under carbon constrained regulatory regime that might exist in the future similarly final regulation under section of the clean air act may not provide sufficient incentive for state to utilize carbon free nuclear power mean of meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction requirement while continuing policy of favoring renewable energy source current state level climate change and renewable regulation is already providing incentive for regional wind development the registrant can not predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposal may become law or what their effect will be on the registrant generation could be negatively affected by possible federal or state legislative or regulatory action that could affect the scope and functioning of the wholesale market exelon and generation federal and state legislative and regulatory body are facing pressure to address consumer concern or are raising concern that energy price in wholesale market are high or insufficient generation is being built because the competitive model is not working and therefore are considering some form of regulation or some other mean of reducing wholesale market price or subsidizing new generation generation is dependent on robust and competitive wholesale energy market to achieve it business objective approximately of generation generating resource which include directly owned asset and capacity obtained through long term contract are located in the area encompassed by pjm generation future result of operation will depend on ferc continued adherence to and support for policy that favor the preservation of competitive wholesale power market such pjm and the absence of material change to market structure that would limit or otherwise negatively

affirming generation authority to sell at market based rate and none denying that authority the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the act wa enacted in july the part of the act that applies to exelon is title vii which is known the dodd frank wall street transparency and accountability act dodd frank dodd frank requires the creation of new regulatory regime for over the counter swap swap including mandatory clearing for certain category of swap incentive to shift swap activity to exchange trading margin and capital requirement and other obligation designed to promote transparency for non security based swap including commodity swap dodd frank empowers the commodity future trading commission cftc to promulgate regulation implementing the law objective the primary aim of dodd frank is to regulate the key intermediary in the swap market which entity are either swap dealer sd major swap participant msps and certain other financial entity but the law also applies to lesser degree to end user of swap on january president obama signed into law bill that exempts from margin requirement swap used by end user to hedge or mitigate commercial risk moreover the cftc dodd frank regulation preserve the ability of end user in the energy industry to hedge their risk using swap without being subject to mandatory clearing and accepts or exempts end user from many of the other substantive regulation accordingly an end user generation is conducting it commercial business in manner that doe not require registration with the cftc an sd or msp generation doe not anticipate transacting in the future in manner in which it would become sd or msp there are however some rulemakings that have not yet been finalized including the capital and margin rule for non cleared swap generation doe not expect these rule to directly impact it collateral requirement however depending on the substance of these final rule in addition to certain international regulatory requirement still under development and that are similar to dodd frank generation swap counterparties could be subject to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirement these regulation could motivate the sd and msps to increase collateral requirement or cash posting from their counterparties including generation generation continues to monitor the rulemaking proceeding with respect to the capital and margin rule but can not predict to what extent if any further refinement to dodd frank requirement may impact it cash flow or financial position but such impact could be material comed peco and bge could also be subject to some dodd frank requirement to the extent they were to enter into swap however at this time management of comed peco and bge continue to expect that their company will not be materially affected by dodd frank generation affiliation with comed peco and bge together with the presence of substantial percentage of generation physical asset base within the comed peco and bge service territory could increase generation cost of business to the extent future complaint or challenge regarding comed peco and or bge retail rate result in settlement

nuclear facility exelon and generation nuclear capacity factor capacity factor for generating unit particularly capacity factor for nuclear generating unit significantly affect generation result of operation nuclear plant operation involve substantial fixed operating cost but produce electricity at low variable cost due to nuclear fuel cost typically being lower than fossil fuel cost consequently to be successful generation must consistently operate it nuclear facility at high capacity factor lower capacity table of content factor increase generation operating cost by requiring generation to produce additional energy from primarily it fossil facility or purchase additional energy in the spot or forward market in order to satisfy generation obligation to committed third party sale including comed peco and bge these source generally have higher cost than generation incurs to produce energy from it nuclear station nuclear refueling outage in general refueling outage are planned to occur once every to month the total number of refueling outage along with their duration could have significant impact on generation result of operation when refueling outage last longer than anticipated or generation experience unplanned outage capacity factor decrease and generation face lower margin due to higher energy replacement cost and or lower energy sale nuclear fuel quality the quality of nuclear fuel utilized by generation could affect the efficiency and cost of generation operation certain of generation nuclear unit have previously had limited number of fuel performance issue remediation action could result in increased cost due to accelerated fuel amortization increased outage cost and or increased cost due to decreased generation capability operational risk operation at any of generation nuclear generation plant could degrade to the point where generation ha to shut the plant or operate at le than full capacity if this were to happen identifying and correcting the cause could require significant time and expense generation could choose to close plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning the plant to full capacity in either event generation could lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment in addition generation may not achieve the anticipated result under it series of

including scheduled contribution to and earnings on the decommissioning trust fund the nrc funding level are based upon the assumption that decommissioning will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit forecasting trust fund investment earnings and cost to decommission nuclear generating station requires significant judgment and actual result may differ significantly from current estimate the performance of capital market also could significantly affect the value of the trust fund currently generation is making contribution to certain trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount being collected by peco from it customer and remitted to generation while generation through peco ha recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer subject to certain limitation and threshold it ha no recourse to collect additional amount from utility customer for any of it other nuclear unit if there is shortfall of fund necessary for decommissioning if circumstance changed such that generation would be unable to continue to make contribution to the trust fund of the former peco unit based on amount collected from peco customer or if generation no longer had recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer if there wa shortfall of fund for decommissioning the adequacy of the trust fund related to the former peco unit could be negatively

negatively affected by risk arising from it ownership and operation of hydroelectric facility exelon and generation ferc ha the exclusive authority to license most non federal hydropower project located on navigable waterway federal land or connected to the interstate electric grid the license for the conowingo hydroelectric project expires september and the license for the muddy run pumped storage project expires on december ferc is required to issue annual license for the facility until final determination is made on the license renewal generation can not predict whether it will receive all the regulatory approval for the renewed license of it hydroelectric facility if ferc doe not issue new operating license for generation hydroelectric facility or station can not be operated through the end of it operating license generation result of operation could table of content be adversely affected by increased depreciation rate and accelerated future decommissioning cost since depreciation rate and decommissioning cost estimate currently include assumption that license renewal will be received generation could also lose revenue and incur increased fuel and purchased power expense to meet supply commitment in addition condition could be imposed part of the license renewal process that could adversely affect operation could require substantial increase in capital expenditure or could result in increased operating cost and significantly affect generation result of operation or financial position similar effect could result from change in the federal power act or the applicable regulation due to event at hydroelectric facility owned by others well those owned by generation comed peco and bge operating cost and customer and regulator opinion of comed peco and bge respectively are affected by their ability to maintain the availability and reliability of their delivery and operational system exelon comed peco and bge failure of the equipment or facility including information system used in comed peco and bge delivery system could interrupt the electric transmission and electric and natural gas delivery which could negatively impact related revenue and increase maintenance and capital expenditure equipment or facility failure can be due to number of factor including weather or information system failure specifically if the implementation of advanced metering infrastructure smart grid or other technology in comed peco or bge service territory fail to perform intended or are not successfully integrated with billing and other information system comed peco and bge result of operation cash flow or financial condition could be negatively impacted furthermore if any of the financial accounting or other data processing system fail or have other significant shortcoming comed peco or bge financial result could be negatively impacted if an employee cause the operational system to fail either result of inadvertent error or by deliberately tampering with or manipulating the operational system comed peco or bge financial result could also be negatively impacted in addition dependence upon automated system may further increase the risk that operational system flaw or employee tampering or manipulation of those system will result in loss that are difficult to detect the aforementioned failure or those of other utility including prolonged or repeated failure could affect customer satisfaction and the level of regulatory oversight and comed peco and bge maintenance and capital expenditure regulated utility which are required to provide service to all customer within their service territory have generally been afforded liability protection against claim by customer relating to failure of service under illinois law however comed could be required to pay damage to it customer in some circumstance involving extended outage affecting large number of it customer and those damage could be material to comed result of operation or cash flow see note commitment and contingency of the combined note to consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding proceeding related to storm related outage in comed service territory comed peco and bge respective ability to deliver electricity their operating cost and their capital expenditure could be negatively impacted by transmission congestion exelon comed peco and bge demand for electricity within comed peco and bge service area could stress available transmission capacity requiring alternative routing or curtailment of electricity usage with consequent effect on operating cost revenue and result of operation also insufficient availability of electric supply to meet customer demand could jeopardize comed peco and bge ability to comply with reliability standard and strain customer and regulatory agency relationship with all utility potential concern over transmission capacity or generation facility retirement could result in pjm or ferc

cybersecurity risk exelon generation comed peco and bge the registrant face physical security and cybersecurity risk the owner operator of generation transmission and distribution facility and participant in commodity trading threat source continue to seek to exploit potential vulnerability in the electric and natural gas utility industry associated with protection of sensitive and confidential information grid infrastructure and other energy infrastructure and such attack and disruption both physical and cyber are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dynamic continued implementation of advanced digital technology increase the potentially unfavorable impact of such attack security breach of the physical asset or information system of the registrant their competitor interconnected entity in rtos and isos or regulator could impact the operation of the generation fleet and or reliability of the transmission and distribution system or subject the registrant to financial harm associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain type of information including sensitive customer vendor employee trading or other confidential data the risk of these system related event and security breach occurring continues to intensify and while have been and will likely continue to be subjected to physical and cyber attack to date we have not experienced material breach or disruption to our network or information system or our service operation however such attack continue to increase in sophistication and frequency we may be unable to prevent all such attack in the future if significant breach occurred the reputation of exelon and it customer supply activity may be adversely affected customer confidence in the registrant or others in the industry may be diminished or exelon and it subsidiary may be subject to legal claim any of which may contribute to the loss of customer and have negative impact on the business and or result of operation moreover the amount and scope of insurance we maintain against loss resulting from any such event or security breach may not be sufficient to cover our loss or otherwise adequately compensate for any disruption to our business that may result comed peco and bge deployment of smart meter throughout their service territory may increase the risk of damage from an intentional disruption of the system by third party in addition new or updated security regulation or unforeseen threat source could require change in current measure taken by the registrant or their business operation and could adversely affect their result of operation cash flow and financial position failure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could negatively impact the registrant result of operation exelon generation comed peco and bge certain event such an employee strike loss of contract resource due to major event and an aging workforce without appropriate replacement could lead to operating challenge and increased cost for the registrant the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge and lengthy time period associated with skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost could arise the registrant are particularly affected due to the specialized knowledge required of the technical and support employee for their generation transmission and distribution operation if the registrant are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce their result of operation could be negatively impacted the registrant could make investment in new business initiative including initiative mandated by regulator and market that may not be successful and acquisition could not

the need for market design change to ensure long term power system reliability in southern illinois the desire to provide illinois policy maker with additional time to consider needed reform well the potential long term impact of epa clean power plan exelon and generation previously committed to cease operation of the oyster creek nuclear plant by the end of exelon and generation have not made any decision regarding potential nuclear plant closure at other site at this time result of decision to early retire one or more other nuclear plant certain change in accounting treatment would be triggered and exelon and generation result of operation and cash flow could be materially affected by number of item including among other item accelerated depreciation expense impairment charge related to inventory that can not be used at other nuclear unit and cancellation of in flight capital project accelerated amortization of plant specific nuclear fuel cost employee related cost severance relocation retention etc accelerated asset retirement obligation expense related to future decommissioning activity and additional funding of nuclear decommissioning trust fund in addition any early plant retirement would also result in reduced operating cost lower fuel expense and lower capital expenditure in the period beyond shutdown while there are number of generation nuclear plant that are at risk of early retirement the following table provides the balance sheet amount of december for significant asset and liability associated with the three nuclear plant currently considered by management to be at the greatest risk of early retirement due to their current economic valuation and other factor in million quad city clinton ginna total asset balance material and supply inventory nuclear fuel inventory net completed plant net construction work in progress liability balance asset retirement obligation nrc license renewal term assumes clinton seek and receives year operating license renewal extension in the event decision is made to retire early one or more nuclear plant the precise timing of the retirement date and resulting financial statement impact is uncertain and would be influenced by number of factor such the result of any transmission system reliability study assessment the nature of any co owner requirement and stipulation and decommissioning trust fund requirement among other factor however the earliest retirement date for any plant would usually be the first year in which the unit doe not have capacity obligation and just prior to it next scheduled nuclear refueling outage date in that year nrc regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that sufficient fund will be available in certain minimum amount to decommission the facility these nrc minimum funding level are based upon the assumption that decommissioning activity will commence after the end of the current licensed life of each unit if unit fails the nrc table of content minimum funding test then generation would be required to take step such providing financial guarantee through letter of credit or parent company guarantee or making additional cash contribution to the ndtf to ensure sufficient fund are available of december all three of generation plant at the highest risk of early retirement quad city clinton and ginna pas the nrc minimum funding test based on their current license life see note asset retirement obligation for additional information on nrc minimum funding requirement however in the event of an early retirement just before their next individual refueling outage it is estimated that clinton and ginna would no longer meet the nrc minimum funding requirement due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activity and shorter time period over which the ndtf investment could appreciate in value quad city would also be at risk however the size of the guarantee are ultimately dependent on the decommissioning approach adopted at each site decon delayed decon and safstor the associated level of cost and the decommissioning trust fund investment performance going forward considering the three alternative decommissioning approach available to generation for each site parental guarantee of up to million million and million for clinton ginna and quad city respectively could be required in order for each site to access it ndtf for radiological decommissioning cost in addition upon issuance of any required financial guarantee while all three site would be able to utilize their respective decommissioning trust fund for radiological decommissioning cost the nrc must approve an additional exemption in order for generation to utilize the ndtf fund to pay for non radiological decommissioning cost spent fuel management and site restoration cost if unit doe not receive this exemption the cost would be borne by generation accordingly based on current projection it is expected that some portion of the spent fuel management and or site restoration cost would need to be funded through supplemental cash from generation while the ultimate amount may vary greatly and could be reduced by alternate decommissioning scenario and or reimbursement of certain cost under doe reimbursement agreement or future litigation across the three alternative decommissioning approach available to generation for the next year clinton and ginna could incur spent fuel management and site restoration cost of up to million and million net of tax respectively the cost associated with ginna would be shared by the plant co owner at their respective ownership percentage if quad city fails the exemption test at it ownership percentage generation could be required to pay for spent fuel management cost of up to million net of tax but quad city is better positioned to pas the test than the other two plant power market price of fuel the use of new technology to recover natural gas from shale deposit is increasing natural gas supply and reserve which place downward pressure on natural gas price and therefore on wholesale and retail power price which result in reduction in exelon revenue forward natural gas price have declined significantly over the last several year in part reflecting an increase in supply due to strong natural gas production due to shale gas development capacity market change in pjm in the wake of the january polar vortex that blanketed much of the eastern and midwestern united state it became clear that while major outage event wa narrowly avoided resource in pjm were not providing the level of reliability expected by customer result on december pjm filed at ferc proposal to make significant change to it current capacity market construct the reliability pricing model rpm pjm proposed change generally sought to improve resource performance and reliability largely by limiting the excuse for non performance and by increasing the penalty for performance failure the proposal permit supplier to include in capacity market offer additional cost and risk so they can meet these higher performance requirement while offer are expected to put upward pressure on capacity clearing price operational improvement made result of pjm proposal are expected to improve table of content reliability to reduce energy production cost result of more efficient operation and to reduce the need for out of market energy payment to supplier generation participated actively in pjm stakeholder process through which pjm developed the proposal and also actively participated in the ferc proceeding including filing comment on june ferc approved pjm filing largely proposed by pjm including transitional auction rule for delivery year through result of this and several related order pjm hosted it base residual auction result posted on august and it transitional auction for delivery year result posted on august and it transitional auction for delivery year result posted on september miso capacity market result on april the midcontinent independent system operator miso released the result of it capacity auction covering the june through may delivery year result of the auction capacity price for the zone region in downstate illinois increased to per mw per day beginning in june an increase from the prior pricing of per mw per day that wa in effect from june to may generation had an offer that wa selected in the auction however due to generation ratable hedging strategy the result of the capacity auction have not had material impact on exelon and generation consolidated result of operation and cash flow additionally in late may and june separate complaint were filed at the ferc by each of the state of illinois the southwest electric cooperative public citizen inc and the illinois industrial energy consumer challenging the result of this miso capacity auction for the delivery in miso delivery zone the complaint allege generally that the result of the capacity auction for zone are not just and reasonable the result should be suspended set for hearing and replaced with new just and reasonable rate refund date should be established and that certain alleged behavior by one of the market participant other than exelon or generation be investigated on october the ferc announced that it wa conducting non public investigation that doe not involve exelon or generation into whether market manipulation or other potential violation occurred related to the auction on december the ferc issued decision that certain of the rule governing the establishment of capacity price in downstate illinois are not just and reasonable on prospective basis the ferc ordered that certain rule must be changed for the next auction scheduled for april that will set capacity price beginning june in response to this order miso must file certain rule change with the ferc within day and certain other change within day the ferc continues to conduct it non public investigation to determine if the april auction result were manipulated and if so whether refund are appropriate the ferc did establish may the day the first complaint wa filed the date from which refund if ordered would be calculated and it also made clear that the finding in the december order do not prejudge the investigation or related proceeding generation can not predict the impact the ferc order may ultimately have on future auction result capacity pricing or decision related to the potential early retirement of the clinton nuclear plant however such impact could be material to generation future result of operation and cash flow see note implication of potential early plant retirement of the combined note to the consolidated financial statement for additional information on the impact of the miso announcement miso ha acknowledged the need for capacity market design change in the zone region and stated that reform to it capacity market process may be required to drive future investment and that it plan to engage stakeholder to consider such reform the ferc ha also encouraged such effort subsidized generation the rate of expansion of subsidized generation including low carbon generation such wind and solar energy in the market in which generation output is sold can negatively impact wholesale power price and in turn generation result of operation table of content various state have attempted to implement or propose legislation regulation or other policy to subsidize new generation development which may result in artificially depressed wholesale energy and capacity price for example the new jersey legislature enacted into law in january the long term capacity pilot program act lcapp lcapp provides eligible generator with year fixed contract for the sale of capacity in the pjm capacity market under lcapp the local utility in new jersey are required to pay or receive the difference between the price eligible generator receive in the capacity market and the price guaranteed under the year contract new jersey ultimately selected three proposal to participate in lcapp and build new generation in the state in addition on april the mdpsc issued an order directing the maryland electric utility to enter into year contract for difference cfd with cpv maryland llc cpv under which cpv will construct an approximately mw combined cycle gas turbine in waldorf maryland that it projected would be in commercial operation by june cpv subsequently sought to extend that date the cfd mandated that utility including bge pay or receive the difference between cpv contract price and the revenue it receives for capacity and energy from clearing the unit in the pjm capacity market exelon and others challenged the constitutionality and other aspect of the new jersey legislation in federal court the action taken by the mdpsc were also challenged in federal court in an action to which exelon wa not party the federal trial court in both the new jersey and maryland action effectively invalidated the action taken by the new jersey legislature and the mdpsc respectively each of those decision wa upheld by the court of appeal for the third circuit and the court of appeal for the fourth circuit respectively however the supreme court ha agreed to review the matter and there is risk the supreme court will overrule the lower court required under their contract generator developer who were selected in the new jersey and maryland program including cpv offered and cleared in pjm capacity market auction to the extent that the state required customer subsidy are included under their respective contract exelon belief that these project may have artificially suppressed capacity price in pjm in these auction and may continue to do so in future auction to the detriment of exelon market driven position while the court decision in new jersey and maryland are positive development continuation of these state effort if successful and unabated by an effective minimum offer price rule mopr for future capacity auction could continue to result in artificially depressed wholesale capacity and or energy price other state could seek to establish program which could substantially impact exelon market driven position and could have significant effect on exelon financial result of operation financial position and cash flow one such state is ohio where state regulated utility company firstenergy ohio fe and aep ohio aep have initiated action at the public utility commission of ohio puco to obtain approval for rider that would effectively allow these two company to pas through to all customer in their service territory the difference between their cost and market revenue on ppas entered into between the utility and it merchant generation affiliate collectively more than of primarily coal fired generation owned by fe and aep affiliate seek ratepayer guaranteed subsidy via the proposed rider thus the rider are similar to the cfds described above except that the ppa rider in ohio would apply to certain existing generation facility whereas the cfds applied to new generation facility while aep and fe initially filed for these rider in and respectively it wa not until late that the proposal obtained meaningful traction when puco staff entered into settlement and stipulation with the ohio utility supporting the proposal and recommending that the puco approve the rider exelon is participant in these proceeding although the matter is still in hearing and decision by the puco is not expected until late february early march it is increasingly likely that these subsidy may be approved by the puco litigation around these approval is also likely exelon opposes the proposal in ohio continues to monitor development in maryland and new jersey and participates in stakeholder and other process to ensure that similar state subsidy are table of content not developed exelon remains active in advocating for competitive market while opposing policy that require taxpayer and or consumer to subsidize or give preferential treatment to generation provider or technology that do not provide superior reliability or environmental benefit or that would threaten the reliability and value of the integrated electricity grid energy demand modest economic growth partially offset by energy efficiency initiative is resulting in positive growth for electricity for bge and peco and decrease in projected load for electricity for comed bge peco and comed are projecting load volume to increase decrease by and respectively in compared retail competition generation retail operation compete for customer in competitive environment which affect the margin that generation can earn and the volume that it is able to serve the market experienced high price volatility in the first quarter of which contributed to bankruptcy and consolidation within the industry during the year however forward natural gas and power price are expected to remain low and thus we expect retail competitor to stay aggressive in their pursuit of market share and that wholesale generator including generation will continue to use their retail operation to hedge generation output strategic policy alignment exelon routinely review it hedging policy dividend policy operating and capital cost capital spending plan strength of it balance sheet and credit metric and sufficiency of it liquidity position by performing various

dividend policy the approved policy would raise our dividend each year for the next three year beginning with the june dividend the board will take formal action to declare the next dividend in the second quarter hedging strategy exelon policy to hedge commodity risk on ratable basis over three year period is intended to reduce the financial impact of market price volatility generation is exposed to commodity price risk associated with the unhedged portion of it electricity portfolio generation enters into non derivative and derivative contract including financially settled swap future contract and swap option and physical option and physical forward contract all with credit approved counterparties to hedge this anticipated exposure generation ha hedge in place that significantly mitigate this risk for and however generation is exposed to relatively greater commodity price risk in the subsequent year with respect to which larger portion of it electricity portfolio is currently unhedged of december the percentage of expected generation hedged for the major reportable segment wa and for and respectively the percentage of expected generation hedged is the amount of equivalent

the act that applies to exelon is title vii which is known the dodd frank wall street transparency and accountability act dodd frank dodd frank requires the creation of new regulatory regime for over the counter swap swap including mandatory clearing for certain category of swap incentive to shift swap activity to exchange trading margin and capital requirement and other obligation designed to promote transparency for non security based swap including commodity swap dodd frank empowers the commodity future trading commission cftc to promulgate regulation implementing the law objective the primary aim of dodd frank is to regulate the key intermediary in the swap market which entity are either swap dealer sd major swap participant msps and certain other financial entity but the law also applies to lesser degree to end user of swap on january president obama signed into law bill that exempts from margin requirement swap used by end user to hedge or mitigate commercial risk moreover the cftc dodd frank regulation preserve the ability of end user in the energy industry to hedge their risk using swap without being subject to mandatory clearing and excepts or exempts end user from many of the other substantive regulation accordingly an end user generation is conducting it commercial business in manner that doe not require registration with the cftc an sd or msp generation doe not anticipate transacting in the future in manner in which it would become sd or msp there are however some rule including the capital and margin rule for non cleared swap that do not impact generation collateral requirement directly but may have an indirect impact table of content these rule in addition to certain international regulatory requirement still under development and that are similar to dodd frank could subject generation sd or msp counterparties to additional and potentially significant capitalization requirement and could motivate the sd and msps to increase collateral requirement or cash posting from their counterparties including generation generation can not predict to what extent if any further refinement to dodd frank and international regulatory requirement relating to swap may impact it cash flow or financial position but such impact could be material comed peco and bge could also be subject to some dodd frank requirement to the extent they were to

december the authoritative guidance requires that generation estimate it obligation for the future decommissioning of it nuclear generating plant to estimate that liability generation us an internally developed probability weighted discounted cash flow model which on unit by unit basis considers multiple decommissioning outcome scenario result of recent nuclear plant retirement in the industry nuclear operator and third party service provider are obtaining more information about cost associated with decommissioning activity at the same time regulator are gaining more information about decommissioning activity which could result in change to existing decommissioning requirement in addition more nuclear plant are retired it is possible that technological advance will be identified that could create efficiency and lead to reduction in decommissioning cost these factor could result in material change to generation current estimate more information becomes available and could change the timing and probability assigned to the decommissioning outcome scenario the nuclear decommissioning obligation is adjusted on regular basis due to the passage of time and revision to the key assumption for the expected timing and or estimated amount of the future undiscounted cash flow required to decommission the nuclear plant based upon the methodology and significant estimate and assumption described follows decommissioning cost study generation us unit by unit decommissioning cost study to provide marketplace assessment of the cost and timing of decommissioning activity which are validated by comparison to current decommissioning project within it industry and other estimate decommissioning cost study are updated on rotational basis for each of generation nuclear unit at least every five year unless circumstance warrant more frequent update such change in assumed operating life for nuclear plant part of the annual cost study update process generation evaluates newly assumed cost or substantive change in previously assumed cost to determine if the cost estimate impact are sufficiently material to warrant application of the updated estimate to the aros across the nuclear fleet outside of the normal five year rotating cost study update cycle cost escalation factor generation us cost escalation factor to escalate the decommissioning cost from the decommissioning cost study discussed above through the assumed decommissioning period for each of the unit cost escalation study updated on an annual basis are used to determine escalation factor and are based on inflation index for labor equipment and material energy llrw disposal and other cost all of the nuclear aros are adjusted each year for the updated cost escalation factor probabilistic cash flow model generation probabilistic cash flow model include the assignment of probability to various scenario for decommissioning cost level decommissioning approach and timing of plant shutdown on unit by unit basis probability assigned to cost level include an assessment of the likelihood of cost higher high cost scenario or lower low cost scenario than the base cost scenario probability are also assigned to three different decommissioning approach follows decon method of decommissioning shortly after the cessation of operation in which the equipment structure and portion of facility and site containing radioactive contaminant are removed and safely buried in llrw landfill or decontaminated to level that permit property to be released for unrestricted use delayed decon similar to the decon scenario but with delay to allow for spent fuel to be removed from the site prior to onset of decommissioning activity or table of content safstor method of decommissioning in which the nuclear facility is placed and maintained in such condition that the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated to level that permit release for unrestricted use generally within year after cessation of operation the actual decommissioning approach selected once nuclear facility is shutdown will be determined by generation at the time of shutdown and may be influenced by multiple factor including the funding status of the nuclear decommissioning trust fund at the time of shutdown the assumed plant shutdown timing scenario have historically included the following two alternative the probability of operating through the original year nuclear license term and the probability of operating through an extended year nuclear license term regardless of whether such year license extension had been received for each unit during due to changing market condition and regulatory environment generation began to consider and incorporate assumption regarding plant shutdown timing scenario for certain plant other than just the two scenario historically considered in addition to potential early shutdown scenario generation also began in to incorporate into it aro estimate some probability of second year license renewal for some nuclear unit the successful operation of nuclear plant in the beyond the initial year license term ha prompted the nrc to consider regulatory and technical requirement for potential plant operation for an year nuclear operating term power market and regulatory environment development occur generation evaluates and incorporates necessary the impact of such development into it nuclear aro assumption and estimate generation probabilistic cash flow model also include an assessment of the timing of doe acceptance of snf for disposal generation currently assumes doe will begin accepting snf in the snf acceptance date assumption wa based on management estimate of the amount of time required for doe to select site location and develop the necessary infrastructure for long term snf storage for more information regarding the estimated date that doe will begin accepting snf see note commitment and contingency of the combined

unit and for which the nrc approved the renewed license on january none of generation previous application for an operating license extension ha been denied the year license renewal for oyster creek nuclear unit wa obtained in however operation will cease by the end of for it remaining three operating unit generation is in various stage of the process of pursuing similar extension and ha filed license renewal application for two operating nuclear unit and ha until to seek license renewal for one remaining operating nuclear unit generation assumption regarding successful license extension for the remaining three operating unit for aro determination purpose is based in part on the good current physical condition and high performance of these nuclear unit the favorable status of the ongoing license renewal proceeding with the nrc and the successful renewal for twenty one unit to date generation estimate that the failure to obtain initial license renewal to extend the operating life from year to year at any of it remaining nuclear unit assuming all other assumption remain constant would increase it aro on average approximately million per unit of december the size of the increase to the aro for particular nuclear unit is dependent upon the current stage in it original license term and it specific decommissioning cost estimate if generation doe not receive license renewal on particular unit the increase to the aro may be mitigated by generation ability to delay ultimate decommissioning activity under safstor method of decommissioning table of content discount rate the probability weighted estimated future cash flow using these various scenario are discounted using credit adjusted risk free rate carfr applicable to the various business in which each of the nuclear unit originally operated the accounting guidance required generation to establish an aro at fair value at the time of the initial adoption of the current accounting standard subsequent to the initial adoption the aro is adjusted for change to estimated cost timing of future cash flow and modification to decommissioning assumption described above increase in the aro result of upward revision in estimated undiscounted cash flow are considered new obligation and are measured using current carfr the increase creates new cost layer within the aro any decrease in the estimated undiscounted future cash flow relating to the aro are treated modification of an existing aro and therefore are measured using the average historical carfr rate used in creating the initial aro cost layer under the current accounting framework the aro is not required or permitted to be re measured for change in the carfr that occur in isolation this differs from the accounting requirement for other long dated obligation such pension and other post employment benefit that are required to be re measured and when corresponding discount rate change if generation future nominal cash flow associated with the aro were to be discounted at current prevailing carfrs the obligation would increase from approximately billion to approximately billion the ultimate decommissioning obligation will be funded by the ndts the ndts are recorded on exelon and generation consolidated balance sheet at december at fair value of approximately billion and have an estimated targeted annual pre tax return of to to illustrate the significant impact that change in the carfr when combined with change in projected amount and expected timing of cash flow can have on the valuation of the aro had generation used the carfrs rather than the carfrs in performing it third quarter aro update generation would have increased the aro by approximately million compared to the actual increase to the aro of million and ii if the carfr used in performing the third quarter aro update which also reflected increase in the amount and change to the timing of projected cash flow wa increased by basis point or decreased by basis point the aro would have increased by million and billion respectively compared to the actual increase of million aro sensitivity change in the assumption underlying the foregoing item could materially affect the decommissioning obligation the impact to the aro of change in any one of these assumption is highly dependent on how the other assumption will change well

reporting unit to it carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds it fair value the second step is performed the second step requires an allocation of fair value to the individual asset and liability using purchase price allocation accounting guidance in order to determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is le than the carrying amount an impairment loss is recorded reduction to goodwill and charge to operating expense application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment including the identification of reporting unit and determining the fair value of the reporting unit which management estimate using weighted combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market multiple analysis significant assumption used in these fair value analysis include discount and growth rate utility sector market performance and transaction projected operating and capital cash flow for comed business

asset group for impairment utilizes significant assumption about operating strategy and estimate of future cash flow which require assessment of current and projected market condition for the generation business forecasting future cash flow requires assumption regarding forecasted commodity price for the sale of power cost of fuel and the expected operation of asset variation in the assumption used could lead to different conclusion regarding the recoverability of an asset or asset group and thus could have significant effect on the consolidated financial statement an impairment evaluation is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flow of the long lived asset or asset group are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability for the generation business the lowest level of independent cash flow is determined by the evaluation of several factor including the geographic dispatch of the generation unit and the

exercise significant judgment including assessing the market liquidity well determining whether contract ha one or more underlyings and one or more notional amount further interpretive guidance related to the authoritative literature continues to evolve including how it applies to energy and energy related product change in management assessment of contract and the liquidity of their market and change in authoritative guidance related to derivative could result in previously excluded contract being subject to the provision of the authoritative derivative guidance generation ha determined that contract to purchase uranium contract to purchase and sell capacity in certain iso certain emission product and recs do not meet the definition of derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement and neither the uranium certain capacity emission nor the rec market are sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contract are readily convertible to cash if these market do become sufficiently liquid in the future and generation would be required to account for these contract derivative instrument the fair value of these contract would be accounted for consistent with generation other derivative instrument in this case if market price differ from the underlying price of the contract generation would be required to record mark to market gain or loss which may have significant impact to exelon and generation financial position and result of operation under current authoritative guidance all derivative are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value except for certain derivative that qualify for and are elected under the normal purchase and normal sale exception further derivative that qualify and are designated for hedge accounting are classified fair value or cash flow hedge for fair value hedge change in fair value for both the derivative and the underlying hedged exposure are recognized

including credit risk the impact of credit and nonperformance risk to date have generally not been material to the financial statement interest rate and foreign exchange derivative instrument the registrant may utilize fixed to floating interest rate swap which are typically designated fair value hedge mean to achieve the targeted level of variable rate debt percent of total debt additionally the registrant may use forward starting interest rate swap and treasury rate lock to lock in interest rate level in anticipation of future financing and floating to fixed swap for project financing in addition generation enters into interest rate derivative contract to economically hedge risk associated with the interest rate component of commodity position the characterization of the interest rate derivative contract between the economic hedge and proprietary trading activity is driven by the corresponding characterization of the underlying commodity position that give rise to the interest rate exposure generation doe not utilize interest rate derivative with the objective of benefiting from shift or change in market interest rate to manage foreign exchange rate exposure associated with international energy purchase in currency other than dollar generation utilizes foreign currency derivative which are typically designated economic hedge the fair value of the agreement is calculated by discounting the future net cash flow to the present value based on the term and condition of the agreement and the forward interest rate and foreign exchange curve these input are based on observable data and valuation of similar instrument the interest rate and foreign exchange derivative are primarily categorized in level in the fair value hierarchy certain exchange based interest

deferred by reinvesting portion of the proceeds from the sale in qualifying replacement property under the like kind exchange provision of the irc the like kind exchange replacement property purchased by exelon included interest in three municipal owned electric generation facility which were properly leased back to the municipality the irs disagreed with this position and asserted that the entire

of tax exelon disagrees with the irs and continues to believe that it like kind exchange transaction is not the same or substantially similar to silo although exelon ha been and remains willing to

non cash equity contribution from exelon in the amount of the net after tax interest charge attributable to comed in connection with the like kind exchange position exelon continues to believe that it is unlikely that the irs assertion of penalty will ultimately be sustained and therefore no liability for the penalty ha been recorded on september the irs issued notice of deficiency to exelon for the like kind exchange position exelon filed petition on december to initiate litigation in the united state tax court and the trial took place in august of exelon wa not required to remit any part of

and timing of estimated decommissioning cash flow and impact of year to date accretion of the aro liability due to the passage of time the increase in the aro during wa primarily driven by an increase of approximately million for cost expected to be incurred for required site security during the decommissioning period in which snf remains on site and until major reactor component and building have been dismantled and removed this projected increase is based on emerging industry experience at nuclear site in the planning or early stage of decommissioning indicating greater than originally expected number of security personnel required to be on site during these decommissioning period generation will continue to monitor emerging security cost trend including potential strategy to limit such cost by for example optimizing the transfer of snf when doe start taking possession of snf or increasing the use of dry snf storage and will adjust the aro liability accordingly the increase in the aro includes an increase of approximately million for the impact of change implemented in the annual assessment of generation snf storage and disposal cost estimation methodology to better align

consolidated balance sheet at fair value including subsequent purchase accounting adjustment upon consolidation of ceng see note investment in constellation energy nuclear group llc the change in the aro wa also driven by an increase for accretion of the obligation and an increase in the estimated cost to decommission byron braidwood and lasalle nuclear unit resulting from the completion of updated decommissioning cost study received during part of the annual assessment these increase in the aro were partially offset by decrease in the aro due to reduction in estimated escalation rate primarily for labor and energy cost the increase in the aro due to the change in and timing of estimated cash flow wa offset within property plant and equipment on exelon and generation consolidated

comprehensive income nuclear decommissioning trust fund investment ndt fund have been established for each generating station unit to satisfy generation nuclear decommissioning obligation generally ndt fund established for particular unit may not be used to fund the decommissioning obligation of any other unit the ndt fund associated with generation nuclear unit have been funded with amount collected from the previous owner and their respective utility customer peco is authorized to collect fund in revenue for decommissioning the former peco nuclear plant through regulated rate and these collection are scheduled through the operating life of the former peco plant the amount collected from peco customer are remitted to generation and deposited into the ndt fund for the unit for which fund are collected every five year peco file rate adjustment with the papuc that reflects peco calculation of the estimated amount needed to decommission each of the former peco unit based on updated fund balance and estimated decommissioning cost the rate adjustment is used to determine the amount collectible from peco customer the most recent rate adjustment occurred on january and the effective rate currently yield annual collection of approximately million the next five year adjustment is expected to be reflected in rate charged to peco customer effective january aside from the former peco unit generation doe not currently collect any amount nor is there any mechanism by which generation can seek to collect additional amount from utility customer apart from the contribution made to the ndt fund from amount previously collected from comed and currently collected from peco customer generation ha not made contribution to the ndt fund any shortfall of fund necessary for decommissioning determined for each generating station unit is ultimately required to be funded by generation with the exception of shortfall for the current decommissioning activity at zion station where certain decommissioning activity have been transferred to third party see zion station decommissioning below and the ceng unit where any shortfall is required to be funded by both generation and edf generation through peco ha recourse to collect additional amount from peco customer related to shortfall of ndt fund for the former peco unit subject to certain limitation and threshold prescribed by an order from the papuc generally peco and likewise generation will not be allowed to collect amount associated with the first million of any shortfall of trust fund compared to decommissioning cost well of any additional shortfall on an aggregate basis for all former peco unit the initial million and up to of any additional shortfall would be borne by generation no recourse exists to collect

subject to certain limitation that allow sharing of excess fund with generation related to the former peco unit with respect to generation other nuclear unit generation retains any fund remaining after decommissioning however in connection with ceng acquisition of the nine mile point and ginna plant and settlement with certain regulatory agency ceng is subject to certain condition pertaining to nuclear decommissioning trust fund that if met could possibly result in obligation to make payment to certain third party clawback for nine mile point and ginna the clawback provision are triggered only in the event that the required decommissioning activity are discontinued or not started or completed in timely manner in the event that the clawback provision are triggered for nine mile point then depending upon the triggering event an amount equal to of the total amount withdrawn from the fund for non decommissioning activity or of any excess fund in the trust fund above the amount required for decommissioning including spent fuel management and decommissioning is to be paid to the nine mile point seller in the event that the clawback provision are triggered for ginna then an amount equal to any estimated cost saving realized by not completing any of the required decommissioning activity is to be paid to the ginna seller generation expects to comply with applicable

decommission the snf dry storage facility associated with zion station pursuant to the asa zionsolutions will periodically request reimbursement from the zion station related ndt fund for cost incurred related to it decommissioning effort at zion station during energysolutions entered definitive acquisition agreement and wa acquired by another company generation reviewed the acquisition it relates to the asa to decommission zion station based on that review generation determined that the acquisition will not adversely impact decommissioning activity under the asa zionsolutions is subject to certain restriction on it ability to request reimbursement from the zion station ndt fund defined within the asa therefore the transfer of the zion station asset did not qualify for asset sale accounting treatment and result the related ndt fund were reclassified to pledged asset for zion station decommissioning within generation and exelon consolidated balance sheet and will continue to be measured in the same manner prior to the completion of the transaction additionally the transferred aro for decommissioning wa replaced with payable for zion station decommissioning in

regulation require that licensee of nuclear generating facility demonstrate reasonable assurance that fund will be available in specified minimum amount to decommission the facility at the end of it life the estimated decommissioning obligation calculated using the nrc methodology differ from the aro recorded on generation and exelon consolidated balance sheet primarily due to difference in the type of cost included in the estimate the basis for estimating such cost and assumption regarding the decommissioning alternative to be used potential license renewal decommissioning cost escalation and the growth rate in the ndt fund under nrc regulation if the minimum funding requirement calculated under the nrc methodology are le than the future value of the ndt fund also calculated under the nrc methodology then the nrc requires either further funding or other financial guarantee key assumption used in the minimum funding calculation using the nrc methodology at december include consideration of cost only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit the option on unit by unit basis to use generic non site specific cost estimate consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit the plant cease operation at the end of their current license life with no assumed license renewal for those unit that have not already received renewal and with an assumed end of operation date of for oyster creek the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimate that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning nor discounted using the carfr and assumed annual after tax return on the ndt fund of for the former peco unit specified by the papuc in contrast the key criterion and assumption used by generation to determine the aro and to forecast the target growth in the ndt fund at december include the use of site specific cost estimate that are updated at least once every five year the inclusion in the aro estimate of all legally unavoidable cost required to decommission the unit radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain unit on site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operation and until doe acceptance and disposal of certain low level radioactive waste the consideration of multiple scenario where decommissioning activity are completed under three possible scenario ranging from to year after the cessation of plant operation the assumption plant cease operating at the end of an extended license life assuming year license renewal extension except oyster creek with an assumed end of operation date of the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated cost and an annual average accretion of the aro of approximately through period of approximately year after the end of the extended life of the unit and an estimated targeted annual pre tax return on the ndt fund of to compared to historical year annual average pre tax return of approximately table of content combined note to consolidated financial statement continued dollar in million except per share data unless otherwise noted generation is required to provide to the nrc

except for zion station which is included on separate report to the nrc submitted by energysolutions see zion station decommissioning above this submittal also included the required updated financial test for the limerick unit parent guarantee that had been established in there wa no change to the amount of the parent guarantee or the funding status of these reactor adequate decommissioning funding assurance wa in place for all reactor owned by generation during the operating license for limerick unit wa extended by year result of this extension and the subsequent funding assurance calculation performed by the nrc it wa found that the parent company guarantee wa no longer required and thus the parent guarantee for limerick unit ha been cancelled effective march see note regulatory matter for additional information regarding the operating license extension for limerick unit generation filed it biennial decommissioning funding status report with the nrc on march this report reflects the status of decommissioning funding assurance of december due to increased cost estimate received in the second half of braidwood unit braidwood unit and byron unit did not meet the nrc minimum funding assurance criterion of december nrc guidance provides licensee with two year or by the time of submitting the next biennial report on or before march to resolve funding assurance shortfall during this period generation will monitor funding assurance and new development including the impact of year license renewal for braidwood and byron to ass the status of funding assurance and to take step if necessary to address any funding shortfall on these fund on or before march on february generation submitted an updated decommissioning funding status report with the nrc for braidwood unit and and byron unit this report reflected the recently approved license renewal for these unit and showed that they have adequate decommissioning funding assurance and that the shortfall identified in the march report ha now been resolved the increased security cost discussed above will be taken into consideration appropriate and in accordance with the regulatory requirement in
