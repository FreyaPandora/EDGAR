the continued growth of demand for the product and service offered by or our seller and our business is affected by general economic and business condition worldwide softening of demand whether caused by change in customer preference or weakening of the or global economy may result in decreased revenue or growth our sale and operating result will also fluctuate for many other reason including due

international operation expose to number of risksour international activity are significant to our revenue and profit and we plan to expand internationally in certain international market segment we have relatively little operating experience and may not benefit from any first to market advantage or otherwise succeed it is costly to establish develop and maintain international operation and website and promote our brand internationally our international operation may not be profitable on sustained basis in addition to risk described elsewhere in this section our international sale and operation are subject to number of risk including local economic and political condition government regulation of commerce and other service electronic device and competition and restrictive governmental action such trade protection measure including export duty and quota and custom duty and tariff nationalization and restriction on foreign ownership restriction on sale or distribution of certain product or service and uncertainty regarding liability for product service and content including uncertainty result of le internet friendly legal system local law lack of legal precedent and varying rule regulation and practice regarding the physical and digital distribution of medium product and enforcement of intellectual property right business licensing or certification requirement such for import export web service and electronic device limitation on the repatriation and investment of fund and foreign currency exchange restriction limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure shorter payable and longer receivable cycle and the resultant negative impact on cash flow law and regulation regarding consumer and data protection privacy network security encryption payment and restriction on pricing or discount lower level of use of the internet lower level of consumer spending and fewer opportunity for growth compared to the lower level of credit card usage and increased payment risk difficulty in staffing developing and managing foreign operation result of distance language and cultural difference different employee employer relationship and the existence of work council and labor union of content compliance with the foreign corrupt practice act and other applicable and foreign law prohibiting corrupt payment to government official and other third party law and policy of the and other jurisdiction affecting trade foreign investment loan and tax and geopolitical event including war and terrorism international commerce and other online and web service grow competition will intensify local company may have substantial competitive advantage of their greater understanding of and focus on the local customer well their more established local brand name we may not be able to hire train retain and manage required personnel which may limit our international growth the people republic of china prc and india regulate amazon and it affiliate business and operation in country through regulation and license requirement that may restrict foreign investment in and operation of the internet it infrastructure data center retail delivery and other sector ii internet content and iii the sale of medium and other product and service for example in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirement www amazon cn is operated by prc company that are indirectly owned either wholly or partially by prc national in addition we provide certain technology service in china in conjunction with third party that hold prc license to provide service in india the government restricts the ownership or control of indian company by foreign entity involved in online multi brand retail trading activity for www amazon in we provide certain marketing tool and logistics service to third party seller to enable them to sell online and deliver to customer and we hold an indirect minority interest in an entity that is third party seller on the www amazon in marketplace although we believe these structure and activity comply with existing law they involve unique risk and the prc is actively considering change in it foreign investment rule that could impact these structure and activity are substantial uncertainty regarding the interpretation of prc and indian law and regulation and it is possible that these government will ultimately take view contrary to ours in addition our chinese and indian business and operation may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliate are unable to access sufficient funding or in china enforce contractual relationship with respect to management and control of such business if our international activity were found to be in violation of any existing or future prc indian or other law or regulation or if interpretation of those law and regulation were to change our business in those country could be subject to fine and other financial penalty have license revoked or be forced to shut entirely if we do not successfully optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data center our business could be harmedif we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data center successfully it could result in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity or result in increased cost impairment charge or or harm our business in other way we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new business with different requirement our fulfillment and data center network become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging there can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our network effectively in addition failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long zone or partial shipment we and our co sourcers may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center if the other business on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment service deliver product to our fulfillment center in excess of forecast we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network we rely on limited number of shipping company to deliver inventory to and completed order to our customer if we are not able to negotiate acceptable term with these company or they experience performance problem or other difficulty it could negatively impact our operating result and customer experience in addition our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed order to customer also may be negatively affected by inclement weather fire flood power loss earthquake labor dispute act of war or terrorism act of god and similar factor under some of our commercial agreement we maintain the inventory of other company thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment network our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other company to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected cost and other harm to our business and reputation of contentsthe seasonality of our business place increased strain on our operationswe expect disproportionate amount of our net sale to occur during our fourth quarter if we do not stock or restock popular product in sufficient amount such that we fail to meet customer demand it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth if we overstock product we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or write offs and incur commitment cost which could reduce profitability we may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrade split shipment and additional long zone shipment necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season if many customer access our website within short period of time due to increased holiday demand we may experience system interruption that make our website unavailable or prevent from efficiently fulfilling order which may reduce the volume of good we sell and the attractiveness of our product and service in addition we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service center during these peak period and delivery and other fulfillment company and customer service co sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand we also face risk described elsewhere in this item relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory we generally have payment term with our

customer service inventory management tax collection payment processing hardware content and third party software and engaging third party to perform service the amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreement is partially dependent on the volume of the other company sale therefore if the other company offering is not successful the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated moreover we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationship and strategic alliance on favorable term we also may be subject to claim from business to which we provide these service if we are unsuccessful in implementing maintaining or developing these service our agreement terminate we may be unable to renew or replace these

detailed disclosure to enable user of financial statement to understand the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contract with customer in august the fasb deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting period beginning after december early adoption is permitted for reporting period beginning after december we evaluate the impact of this asu the more significant change that we have identified relate to the timing of when we recognize revenue and the gross amount of revenue that we present we expect timing change to include amazon branded electronic device sold through retailer which will be recognized at the point of sale to the retailer rather than to end customer and the unredeemed portion of our gift card which we will begin to recognize over the expected customer redemption period which is substantially within nine month rather than waiting until gift card expire or when the likelihood of redemption

continuing to evaluate the impact this asu and related amendment and interpretive guidance will have on our consolidated financial statement we plan to adopt this asu beginning in with cumulative adjustment to retained earnings opposed to retrospectively adjusting prior period in july the fasb issued an asu modifying the accounting for inventory under this asu the measurement principle for
