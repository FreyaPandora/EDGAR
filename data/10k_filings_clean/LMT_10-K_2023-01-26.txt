contract action uca which mean that we begin performing our obligation the term specification or price are finally agreed to between the party although in most case we historically have reached mutual agreement to definitize our uca the government ha the ability to unilaterally definitize contract and ha done in the past absent successful appeal of such action the unilateral definitization of the contract obligates to perform under term and condition imposed by the government the government power to unilaterally definitize contract can affect our ability to negotiate mutually of content agreeable contract term and if contract is unilaterally imposed upon it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flow on program or impose burdensome term portion of our business is classified by the government and can not be specifically described the operating result of classified contract are included in our consolidated financial statement the business risk and capital requirement associated with classified contract historically have not differed materially from those of our other government contract however under certain classified fixed price development and production contract we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property of the classified nature of the contract and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claim to commercial insurer our internal control addressing the financial reporting of classified contract are consistent with our internal control for our non classified contract our operation are subject to and affected by various federal state local and foreign environmental protection law and regulation regarding the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment result of these environmental protection law we are involved in environmental remediation at some of our current and former facility and at third party owned site we have been designated potentially responsible party result of our prior activity and those of our predecessor company while the extent of our financial exposure can not in all case be reasonably estimated the cost of environmental compliance have not had and we do not expect that these cost will have material adverse effect on our earnings financial position and cash flow primarily because substantially all of our environmental cost are allowable in establishing the price of our product and service under our contract with the government for information regarding these matter including current estimate of the amount that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable see critical accounting policy environmental matter in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency included in our note to consolidated financial statement see also the discussion of environmental matter in item risk factor there is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas ghg emission and their potential impact relating to climate change future law regulation or policy in response to concern over ghg emission such carbon tax mandatory reporting and disclosure obligation including environmental requirement for certain federal contractor and subcontractor and the sec proposed climate related disclosure rule and change in procurement policy including the use of environmental goal in proposal evaluation could significantly increase our operational and compliance burden and cost we monitor development in climate change related regulation for their potential effect on and also have comprehensive sustainability program that seek to

and uncertainty can not be eliminated or necessarily predicted the outcome of one or more of these risk could have material effect on our operating result financial position or cash flow should carefully consider the following factor in addition to the other information contained in this annual report on form before deciding to trade in our common stock or debt security risk related to our reliance on government contractswe depend heavily on contract with the government for substantial portion of our business change in the government priority or delay or reduction in spending could have material adverse effect on our business we derived of our total consolidated net sale from the government in including from the dod we expect to continue to derive most of our sale from work performed under government contract budget uncertainty the potential for government shutdown the use of continuing resolution and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our program if appropriation are delayed or government shutdown were to occur and were to continue for an extended period of time we could be at risk of program cancellation and other disruption and nonpayment when the government operates under continuing resolution new contract and program start are restricted and funding for our program may be unavailable reduced or delayed shifting funding priority or federal budget compromise also could result in reduction in overall defense spending on an absolute or inflation adjusted basis which could adversely impact our business we believe our diverse range of product and service generally make it le likely that cut in any specific contract or program will affect our business on long term basis however termination of significant program or contract could adversely affect our business and future financial performance dod change in funding priority also could reduce opportunity in existing program and in future program or initiative where we intend to compete and where we have made investment while we would expect to compete and be well positioned the incumbent on existing program we may not be successful and even if we are successful the replacement program may be funded at lower level or result in lower margin in addition our ability to grow in key area such hypersonics program classified program and next generation franchise program also will be affected by the overall budget environment and whether development program transition to production and the timing of such transition all of which are dependent on government authorization and funding our contract with the government are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriation congress usually appropriates fund on fiscal year fy basis even though contract performance may extend over many year consequently contract are often partially funded initially and additional fund are committed only congress make appropriation over time to the extent we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on contract or in advance of contract award or contract definitization we are at risk of not being reimbursed for those cost unless and additional fund are obligated under the contract or the contract is successfully awarded definitized and funded which could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow of content the program comprises material portion of our revenue and reduction or delay in funding for this program and risk related to the development production sustainment performance schedule cost and requirement of the program could adversely affect our performance the program which consists of multiple development production and sustainment contract is our largest program and represented of our total consolidated net sale in decision by the government or international partner and fm customer country to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned order would have an adverse impact on our business and result of operation given the size and complexity of the program we anticipate that there will be continual review related to aircraft performance program and delivery schedule cost and requirement part of the dod congressional and international country oversight and budgeting process current program challenge include our and our supplier performance including covid performance related challenge software development definitizing and receiving funding for contract on timely basis execution of future flight test and finding resulting from testing and operating the aircraft the level of cost associated with life cycle operation and sustainment inflation related cost pressure and the ability to continue to improve affordability our planned production rate and delivery have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected by covid or supplier performance challenge which affect our result of operation for example during we experienced temporary halt of delivery due to non compliant material in component provided by supplier which affected timing of delivery additionally described in the status of the program in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation we are experiencing pause in aircraft delivery due to the suspension of government furnished equipment gfe engine delivery and corresponding flight restriction that were issued by the government if not resolved in timely manner this could impact our result of operation and cash flow see also the risk factor below captioned we are heavily dependent on supplier and if our subcontractor or other supplier or teaming agreement or joint venture partner fail to perform their obligation our performance and ability to win future business could be adversely affected for discussion of the risk of non compliant part and the supply chain we also may not be successful in making hardware upgrade and other modernization capability in timely manner including result of dependency on supplier which could increase cost and create schedule delay our ability to capture and retain future growth in development production and sustainment is dependent on the success of our effort to achieve sustainment performance customer affordability supply chain improvement continued reliability improvement and other efficiency some of which are outside our control we are subject to extensive procurement law and regulation including those that enable the government to terminate contract for convenience our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with or adapt to existing or new procurement law and regulation which are regularly evolving we and others with which we do business must comply with law and regulation relating to the award administration and performance of government contract government contract law and regulation affect how we do business with our customer and impose certain risk and cost on our business violation of these law and regulation by our employee others working on our behalf supplier or joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fine and penalty the termination of our contract suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contract loss of our ability to export product or perform service and civil or criminal investigation or proceeding in addition cost to comply with new government regulation can increase our cost reduce our margin and adversely affect our competitiveness government contract law and regulation can impose term or obligation that are different than those typically found in commercial transaction one of the significant difference is that the government may terminate any of our government contract not only for default based on our performance but also at it convenience generally prime contractor have similar right under subcontract related to government contract if contract is terminated for convenience we typically would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable cost incurred and the proportionate share of fee or earnings for the work performed however to the extent insufficient fund have been appropriated by the government to the program to cover our cost upon termination for convenience the government may assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding if contract is terminated for default the government could make claim to reduce the contract value or recover it procurement cost and could ass other special penalty exposing to liability and adversely affecting our ability to compete for future contract and order in addition the government could terminate prime contract under which we are subcontractor notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the product or service we delivered were consistent with our contractual obligation subcontractor similarly the government could indirectly terminate program or contract by not appropriating funding the decision to terminate program or contract for convenience or default could adversely affect our business and future financial performance another significant difference from commercial contracting is the existence in government contracting of the concept of an undefinitized contract action uca which is when we begin performing our obligation before the term specification or of content price are finally agreed to between the party when operating under uca the government ha the ability to unilaterally definitize contract which it ha exercised in the past and which absent successful appeal obligates to perform under term and condition imposed by the government this can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract term if contract is unilaterally imposed upon it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flow on program or impose burdensome term in addition to the unique risk associated with government contract the government utilizes procurement policy that could negatively impact our profitability or the ability to win new business for example the government ha procurement policy that shift risk to contractor such using fixed price contract for development program described in the following risk factor other change in procurement policy that could affect the predictability of our profit rate or make it more difficult to compete on certain type of program include favoring more incentive based fee arrangement using different award fee criterion than historically used such the evaluation of environmental factor or making government contract negotiation offer based upon their view of our cost should be compared to our actual cost in addition change in contract financing policy for fixed price contract such change in performance and progress payment policy could significantly affect the timing of our cash flow from time to time the government ha proposed contract term imposed internal policy or taken position that represent fundamental change from historical practice or that we believe are inconsistent with the far or other law and regulation and that could adversely affect our business also portion of our contract are classified by the government which imposes security requirement that limit our ability to discus our performance on these contract including any specific risk dispute and claim additionally the dod is increasingly pursuing rapid acquisition pathway and procedure for new technology including through so called other transaction authority agreement otas otas are exempt from many traditional procurement law including the far and an ota award may be subject in certain case to the condition that significant portion of the work under the ota is performed by non traditional defense contractor or that portion of the cost of the protype project is funded by non governmental source if we can not successfully adapt to the dod rapid acquisition process we may lose strategic new business opportunity in high growth area and our future performance and result could be adversely affected our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contract and program our performance and our ability to control cost our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the type of government contract undertaken the nature of product produced or service performed under those contract the cost incurred in performing the work the achievement of other performance objective and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fee is determined particularly under award and incentive fee contract failure to perform to customer expectation and contract requirement may result in reduced fee or loss and may adversely affect our financial performance contract type primarily include fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under each type of contract if we are unable to control cost our operating result could be adversely affected cost to complete contract may increase for variety of reason including technical and manufacturing challenge schedule delay workforce related issue or inaccurate initial contract cost estimate these could be caused by variety of reason including labor shortage the nature and complexity of the work performed the timeliness and availability of material from supplier internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issue inability to meet cost reduction initiative or achieve efficiency from digital transformation changing law or regulation inflation and natural disaster certain contract may impose other risk such forfeiting fee paying penalty or providing replacement system in the event of performance failure cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded cost schedule or technical performance issue with respect to cost reimbursable contract could result in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation fixed price contract are predominantly either firm fixed price ffp contract or fixed price incentive fpi contract under ffp contract we receive fixed price irrespective of the actual cost we incur and we therefore carry the burden of any cost overrun under fpi contract we generally share with the government saving for cost underruns le than target cost and expense for cost overrun exceeding target cost up to negotiated ceiling price we carry the entire burden of cost overrun exceeding the ceiling price amount under fpi contract due to the fixed price nature of the contract if our actual cost exceed our estimate our margin and profit are reduced and we could incur reach forward loss reach forward loss is when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price when this occurs provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident contract for development program include complex design and technical requirement and are often contracted on cost reimbursable basis however some of our existing development program are contracted on fixed price basis or include cost type contracting for the development phase with fixed price production option we expect we also will bid on similar of content program in the future fixed price development work or fixed price production option especially on competitively bid program is inherently riskier than cost reimbursable work because the revenue is fixed while the estimate of cost required to complete these contract are subject to significant variability due to the complex and often experimental nature of development program the technical complexity coupled with the fixed price contract structure of certain of our ongoing development program or new program increase the risk that our cost will be greater than anticipated resulting in reduced margin operating profit or reach forward loss during the period of contract performance or upon contract award all of which could be significant to our operating result cash flow or financial condition in addition we have certain contract where we bid upfront on cost reimbursable development work and the follow on fixed price production option in one submission this increase the risk that we may experience lower margin than expected or loss on the production option because we must estimate the cost of producing product before it ha been developed these risk may cause not to bid on certain future program which could adversely affect our future growth prospect and financial performance see note organization and significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement for further detail about loss incurred on certain program including fixed price development program we also have contract for the transition from development to production low rate initial production lrip contract where the challenge of starting and stabilizing manufacturing production and test line while the final design is being validated and managing change in requirement or capability create performance and financial risk to our business many of our government contract include multiple option year and our expected sale or profit may be adversely affected if the government decides not to exercise the option on the other hand the government may decide to exercise option for contract under which it is expected that our cost may exceed the contract price or ceiling which could result in loss or unreimbursed cost we are routinely subject to audit by our customer on government contract and the result of those audit could have an adverse effect on our business reputation and result of operation government agency including the defense contract audit agency the defense contract management agency and various agency inspector general routinely audit and investigate government contractor these agency review contractor compliance with applicable law regulation and contract term regarding among other thing contract pricing contract performance cost structure and business system government audit and investigation often take year to complete and many result in no adverse action against like many government contractor we have received audit and investigative report recommending the reduction of certain contract price or that certain payment be repaid delayed or withheld and may involve substantial amount similarly like other government contractor audit and investigation also occur related to cost reimbursement that are based upon our final allowable incurred cost for each year we have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claim related to past year which limit our ability to issue final billing on contract for which authorized and appropriated fund may be expiring or can result in delay in final billing and our ability to close contract if an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activity we may be subject to civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction including reduction of the value of contract contract modification or termination forfeiture of profit suspension of payment penalty fine or suspension or debarment from doing business with the government suspension or debarment could have material adverse effect on because of our dependence on contract with the government in addition we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegation of impropriety were made against similar government oversight and risk to our business and reputation exist in most other country where we conduct business increased competition and bid protest in budget constrained environment may make it more difficult to maintain our financial performance and customer relationship we are facing increased competition from startup and non traditional defense contractor while at the same time many of our customer are facing significant budget pressure and are trying to do more with le by cutting cost using fixed price contract deferring large procurement identifying more affordable solution performing certain work internally rather than hiring contractor and reducing product development cycle if competitor can offer lower cost service and product or provide service or product more quickly at equivalent or in some case even reduced capability we may lose new business opportunity or contract recompetes which could adversely affect our future result furthermore acquisition in our industry including vertical integration also could result in increased competition or limit our access to certain supplier without appropriate remedy to protect our interest to remain competitive we must maintain consistently strong customer relationship seek to understand customer priority and provide superior performance advanced technology solution and service at an affordable cost with the agility that our customer require to satisfy their mission objective in an increasingly price competitive environment our success in achieving these goal may depend among other thing on accurately assessing our customer need and our competitor capability containing our total cost relative to competitor successfully and efficiently investing in emerging technology adopting innovative business model and adaptive pricing method effectively of content collaborating across our business segment and adopting and integrating new digital manufacturing and operating technology and tool into our product lifecycles and process additionally substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding the government increasingly ha relied on competitive contract award type including indefinite delivery indefinite quantity and other multi award contract which have the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase our cost by requiring to submit multiple bid and proposal multi award contract require to make sustained effort to obtain task order under the contract additionally procurement that do not evaluate whether the cost assumption in the bid are realistic can lead to bidder taking aggressive pricing position which could result in the winner realizing loss upon contract award or an increased risk of lower margin or realizing loss over the term of the contract the government also may not award large competitive contract that we otherwise might have in an effort to maintain broader industrial base we may encounter bid protest from unsuccessful bidder on new program award seeking to overturn the award unsuccessful bidder also may protest with the goal of being awarded subcontract for portion of the work in return for withdrawing the protest bid protest can result in significant expense to contract modification or even loss of the contract award and the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can begin and delay the recognition of sale and defer underlying cash flow and adversely affect our operating result our effort to protest or challenge any bid for contract that were not awarded to also may be unsuccessful including the december protest by lockheed martin sikorsky on behalf of team defiant challenging the army award under the future long range assault aircraft competition other risk related to our operationswe are heavily dependent on supplier and if our subcontractor or other supplier or teaming agreement or joint venture partner fail to perform their obligation our performance and ability to win future business could be adversely affected we are the prime contractor on most of our contract and rely on other company to provide material major component and product and to perform portion of the service that are provided to our customer under the term of most of our contract these arrangement may involve subcontract teaming arrangement joint venture or supply agreement with other company upon which we rely contracting party and in many case our contracting party in turn rely on lower tier subcontractor we occasionally have dispute with our contracting party including dispute regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed workshares customer concern about the other party performance issue related to lower tier subcontractor performance our failure to issue or extend task order or our hiring the personnel of subcontractor teammate or joint venture partner or vice versa we also could be adversely affected by action by or issue experienced by our contracting party that are outside of our control such misconduct and reputational issue involving our contracting party which could subject to liability or adversely affect our ability to compete for contract award the failure of our supply chain to comply with regulatory requirement that we flow from our government prime contract also could adversely affect our operating result financial condition or cash flow furthermore change in the political or economic environment may adversely affect the financial stability and viability of our contracting party or lower tier subcontractor or their ability to meet their performance obligation failure by one or more of our contracting party to provide the agreed upon material component or product or perform the agreed upon service on timely basis according to specification including compliance with regulatory requirement we flow down from our prime contract or at all ha and may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligation and require that we transition the work to other company contracting party performance deficiency may result in additional cost or delay in product delivery and affect our operating result and could result in customer terminating our contract for default or convenience default termination could expose to liability and affect our ability to compete for future contract and order failure by our contracting party to meet affordability target could negatively affect our profitability result in contract loss and affect our ability to win new business additionally we are affected by government procurement restriction and issue affecting industry supply chain broadly for example government statute and regulation prohibit the sourcing of certain rare earth mineral from specified country we seek to manage raw material supply risk through long term contract identifying domestic or other allied alternative source of material that could be subject to embargo effort to increase visibility into our multi tiered supply chain and maintaining an acceptable level of our key material in inventory in addition advanced microelectronics including semiconductor underpin many of our current and future critical technology and platform and global shortage of these product due to covid increased demand or other supply chain challenge were experienced in could result in increased procurement lead time and increased cost and potential shortage which could impact our performance we also must comply with specific procurement requirement that can limit the number of eligible supplier and significant number of the component or supply used are currently single or sole sourced because the identification and qualification of new or additional supplier can take an extended period of time issue with supplier or trade action that limit our ability to use certain supplier especially when single or sole sourced can have an adverse impact on our business complying with of content government contracting regulation that limit the source or manufacture of supplier and impose stringent cybersecurity regulation also may create challenge for our supply chain and increase cost we remain heavily dependent on our supply chain for sourcing contractually compliant component which is outside of our direct control and is multi tiered the future occurrence of non compliant component in the or other program could cause suspension in product delivery remediation work on installed component contract price adjustment and alternate supply sourcing all of which could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and cash flow our success depends in part on our ability to develop new technology product and service and efficiently produce and deliver existing product many of the product and service we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technology with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to adapt to changing customer need rapidly identify emerging technological trend develop and manufacture innovative product and service efficiently and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price this includes effort to provide mission solution that integrate capability and resource across all force and domain which we refer to joint all domain operation and to implement emerging digital and network technology and capability to advance our innovation and position to meet our customer requirement we make investment in emerging technology that we believe are needed to keep pace with rapid industry innovation and seek to collaborate with commercial entity that we believe have complementary technology to these commercial entity may not be accustomed to government contracting and may be unwilling to agree to the government customary term including with respect to intellectual property liability and indemnification term due to the complex and often experimental nature of the product and service we offer we may experience and have experienced in the past technical difficulty during the development of new product or technology these technical difficulty could result in delay and higher cost which may negatively impact our financial result and could divert resource from other project until such product or technology are fully developed see note organization and significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement for further detail about loss incurred on certain development program additionally there can be no assurance that our development project will be successful or meet the need of our customer our future success in delivering innovative and affordable solution to our customer relies in part on our multi year business transformation initiative that seek to significantly enhance our digital infrastructure to increase efficiency and collaboration throughout our business while reducing cost this digital transformation effort requires substantial investment and if we are unable to successfully implement the strategy our result of operation and future competitiveness may be adversely affected our competitor may also develop new technology or offering or more efficient way to produce existing product that could cause our existing offering to become obsolete or that could gain market acceptance before our own competitive offering if we fail in our development project or if our new product or technology fail to achieve customer acceptance or competitor develop more capable technology or offering we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new contract or winning all or portion of next generation program and this could adversely affect our future performance and financial result we also may not be successful in our effort to grow in key area such hypersonics classified program and winning next generation franchise program which could adversely affect our future performance adverse macro economic condition including inflation could adversely impact our operating result heightened level of inflation and the potential worsening of macro economic condition including slower growth or recession change to fiscal and monetary policy tighter credit higher interest rate and currency fluctuation present risk for our supplier and the stability of the broader defense industrial base if inflation remains at current level for an extended period or increase and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact our cost are likely to increase resulting in pressure on our profit margin and cash flow particularly for existing fixed price contract for new contract proposal we are factoring into our pricing heightened level of inflation based on accepted dod escalation index and other assumption and in some case seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment epa clause which would permit subject to the particular contractual term cost adjustment in fixed price contract for unexpected inflation in addition our business could be adversely impacted by reduction or delay in spending by non government customer that are facing budget inflationary or other pressure such increase in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rate rising interest rate increase the borrowing cost on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investment while rising interest rate reduce the measure of our gross pension obligation they also can lead to decline in pension plan asset with offsetting impact on our net pension liability although we believe defense spending is more resilient to adverse macro economic condition than many other industrial sector our supplier and other partner many of which are more exposed to of content commercial market or have fewer resource may be adversely impacted to more significant degree than we are by an economic downturn which could affect their performance and adversely impact our operation the effect of covid and other potential future public health crisis epidemic pandemic or similar event on our business operating result financial condition and cash flow are uncertain in our performance wa affected by supply chain disruption and delay well labor challenge associated with employee absence travel restriction site access quarantine restriction remote work and adjusted work schedule the ongoing impact of covid on our operational and financial performance in future period including our ability to execute our program in the expected timeframe remains uncertain and will depend on future covid related development including the impact of covid infection or potential new variant or subvariants the effectiveness and adoption of covid vaccine and therapeutic supplier impact and related government action to prevent and manage disease spread including the implementation of any federal state local or foreign covid related control the long term impact of covid on government budget and other funding priority including international priority that impact demand for our product and service and our business also are difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future result and performance international sale may pose different economic regulatory competition and other risk international sale present risk that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our business in of our total net sale were from international customer international sale are subject to numerous political and economic factor including change in foreign national priority foreign government budget global economic condition and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate including the impact of strong dollar on the affordability of our product the possibility of trade sanction and other government action regulatory requirement significant competition taxation and other risk associated with doing business outside the sale of military product and any associated industrial cooperation agreement also are subject to export regulation and foreign policy and there could be significant delay or other issue in reaching definitive agreement for announced program competition for international sale is intense including from international manufacturer whose government sometimes provide research and development assistance marketing subsidy and other assistance for their product and service our international business is conducted through foreign military sale fm contracted through the government and by direct commercial sale dc to international customer fm contract with the government are subject to the far and the dfars because the government function an intermediary in fm sale we are reliant on the capacity and speed of the dod administration of request from non country to convert request to sale in contrast dc transaction represent sale directly to international customer and are subject to and foreign law and regulation including import export control technology transfer restriction investment taxation repatriation of earnings exchange control the foreign corrupt practice act and other anti corruption law and regulation and the anti boycott provision of the export control reform act of while we have extensive policy in place to comply with such law and regulation failure by our employee or others working on our behalf to comply with these law and regulation could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension debarment from bidding for or performing government contract or suspension of our export privilege which could have material adverse effect on we frequently team with international subcontractor and supplier who also are exposed to similar risk we believe dc transaction present higher level of potential risk because they involve direct commercial relationship with party with which we typically have le familiarity additionally international procurement and local country rule and regulation contract law and judicial system differ from those in the and in some case may be le predictable than those in the which could impair our ability to enforce contract and increase the risk of adverse or unpredictable outcome including the possibility that certain matter that would be considered civil matter in the are treated criminal matter in other country in conjunction with defense procurement some international customer require contractor to comply with industrial cooperation regulation including entering into industrial participation industrial development or localization agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement or contract condition to obtaining order for our product and service these offset agreement or contract generally extend over several year and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitment which may include in country purchase technology transfer local manufacturing support consulting support to in country project investment in joint venture and financial support project and to prefer local supplier or subcontractor the customer expectation in respect of the scope of offset commitment can be substantial including high value content and may exceed existing local technical capability failure to meet these commitment which can be subjective and outside of our control may result in significant penalty and could lead to reduction in sale to country furthermore certain of our existing industrial development agreement are dependent upon the successful operation of joint venture that we do not control and involve product and service that are outside of our core business which may increase the risk that we fail to meet our of content industrial cooperation agreement expose to compliance risk of the joint venture and impair our ability to recover our investment for more information on our industrial development obligation including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligation and potential penalty for non compliance see contractual commitment in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation md geopolitical issue and consideration could have significant effect on our business our business is highly sensitive to geopolitical issue and change in regulation including tariff sanction embargo export and import control and other trade restriction political environment or security risk that may affect our ability to conduct business outside of the including those regarding investment procurement taxation and repatriation of earnings russia invasion of ukraine ha significantly elevated global geopolitical tension and security concern although the conflict ha resulted in increased demand for some of our product the conflict pose certain risk if we are unable to increase production to meet demand on the timeframe expected by potential customer whether it be from supply constraint government funding or otherwise then we may lose sale opportunity they seek alternative even le capable one that may be able to be delivered more quickly in addition the government and other nation have implemented broad economic sanction and export control targeting russia which combined with the conflict have the potential to indirectly disrupt our supply chain and access to certain resource the conflict also ha increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation state and other actor during china announced it may impose sanction against in response to congressional notification of potential foreign military sale to taiwan which included sale of our product we will continue to follow official government guidance it relates to sale to taiwan and do not see material impact on our sale at this time china ha not specified the nature of any such sanction but could seek to restrict our commercial sale or supply chain including the supply of rare earth or other raw material and also could impose sanction on our supplier teammate or partner the nature timing and potential impact of any sanction that may be imposed by china or any other related action that may be taken are uncertain international sale also may be adversely affected by action taken by the government in the exercise of foreign policy congressional oversight or the financing of particular program including the prevention or imposition of condition upon the sale and delivery of our product the imposition of sanction or congressional action to block sale of our product for example the government ha imposed certain sanction on trkish entity and person which ha affected our ability to perform under contract supporting the trkish utility helicopter program tuhp our work with trkish industry and our opportunity for sale in trkiye generally see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation for more information on tuhp in addition government representative have raised concern regarding relationship with the kingdom of saudi arabia where we have existing business and relationship that could be jeopardized if sanction were imposed our inability to perform under contract with international customer result of action taken by the government ha resulted and may in the future result in claim and contract termination by these customer and supplier which could have an adverse effect on our operating result we may be unable to benefit fully from or adequately protect our intellectual property right or use third party intellectual property which could negatively affect our business we own substantial number of and foreign patent and trademark related to the product and service we provide in addition to owning large portfolio of patent and trademark we develop and own other intellectual property including copyright trade secret and research development and engineering know how which contribute significantly to our business we also license intellectual property to and from third party the far and dfars provide that the government obtains certain right in intellectual property including patent developed by and our subcontractor and supplier in performance of government contract or with government funding the government may use or authorize others including competitor to use such intellectual property non government also may have certain right in patent and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contract with these entity the government is pursuing aggressive position regarding the type of intellectual property to which government use right apply and when it is appropriate for the government to insist on broad use right the dod is also implementing an overarching intellectual property acquisition policy that will require greater focus and planning to intellectual property right for it program and we have no assurance to the potential impact of this policy or any associated regulatory change on future acquisition the dod effort could affect our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property and to leverage supplier intellectual property for example if we are unable to obtain necessary license from our supplier to meet government requirement additionally third party may assert that our product or service infringe their intellectual property right which could result in costly and time consuming dispute subject to damage and injunction and adversely affect our ability to compete and perform on contract of content our business and financial performance depends on identifying attracting and retaining highly skilled workforce our performance is dependent upon identifying attracting developing motivating and retaining highly skilled workforce with the requisite skill in multiple area including engineering science manufacturing information technology cybersecurity business development and strategy and management due to the national security nature of our work our performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearance and receive substantial training to work on certain program or task and can be difficult to replace on timely basis if we experience unplanned attrition the market for highly skilled worker and leader in our industry well the market for individual holding high level security clearance is extremely competitive and not confined to our industry for example we compete with commercial technology company outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical cyber and scientific position which may not face the same type of cost pressure government contractor and which may be able to offer more flexible work arrangement given that certain of our employee must perform the majority of their work in secure facility because of the need to access classified information if we can not adequately attract and retain personnel with the requisite skill or clearance in this competitive market our performance and future prospect may be adversely affected workforce dynamic are constantly evolving if we do not manage changing workforce dynamic effectively it could adversely affect our culture reputation and operational flexibility beginning with the covid pandemic significant portion of our workforce began working remotely and we expect significant portion to continue working remotely greater than of the time under our hybrid workforce model if we are unable to effectively adapt to this hybrid work environment long term then we may experience le cohesive workforce increased attrition reduced program performance and le innovation it is also critical that we develop and train employee hire new qualified personnel and successfully manage the short and long term transfer of critical knowledge and skill including leadership development and succession planning throughout our business while we have process in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge and skill the loss of key personnel coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel hire new personnel or transfer knowledge and skill could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contract and execute on new or growing program additionally approximately of our workforce is comprised of employee that are covered by collective bargaining agreement with various union if we encounter difficulty with renegotiations or renewal of collective bargaining arrangement or are unsuccessful in those effort we could incur additional cost and experience work stoppage union action at supplier also can affect any delay or work stoppage could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contract which could negatively impact our result of operation cash flow and financial condition our effort to minimize the likelihood and impact of adverse cybersecurity incident and to protect data and intellectual property may not be successful and our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threat or other disruption given the nature of our business we routinely experience various cybersecurity threat to our information technology infrastructure unauthorized attempt to gain access to our company employee and customer sensitive information insider threat and denial of service attack our customer including site that we operate and manage for our customer supplier subcontractor and joint venture partner experience similar security threat in addition to cyber threat we face threat to the security of our facility and employee and threat from terrorist act which could materially disrupt our business if carried out we could also be impacted by the improper conduct of our employee or others working on behalf of who have access to export controlled or classified information which could adversely affect our business and reputation the threat we face vary from attack common to most industry such ransomware to more advanced and persistent highly organized adversary including nation state actor which target and other defense contractor and other company in industry that are part of critical infrastructure these threat can cause disruption to our business operation if we are unable to protect sensitive information including complying with evolving information security and data protection privacy regulation our customer or governmental authority could question the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection process and procedure moreover depending on the severity of an incident our customer data our employee data our intellectual property including trade secret and research development and engineering know how and other third party data such subcontractor supplier and vendor could be compromised product and service we provide to customer also carry cybersecurity risk including risk that they could be breached or fail to detect prevent or combat attack which could result in loss to our customer and claim against and could harm our relationship with our customer and financial result of content we have an extensive global security organization whose mission is to protect our system and data including computer incident response team cirt to defend against cyber attack and conduct annual training of our employee on protection of sensitive information we also have corporate wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program to proactively identify external and internal threat and mitigate those threat in timely manner additionally we partner with our defense industrial base peer government agency and cyber association to share intelligence to further defend against cyber attack however because of the persistence sophistication and volume of cyber attack we may not be successful in defending against an attack that could have material adverse effect on and due to the evolving nature of these security threat and the national security aspect of much of the data we protect the impact of any future incident can not be predicted national security consideration may also preclude from publicly disclosing cybersecurity incident we also typically work cooperatively with our customer supplier subcontractor joint venture partner and entity we acquire who or which are subject to similar threat to seek to minimize the impact of cyber threat other security threat or business disruption these entity which are typically outside our control and may have access to our information have varying level of cybersecurity expertise and safeguard and their relationship with government contractor including may increase the likelihood that they are targeted by the same cyber threat we face we have thousand of direct supplier and even more indirect supplier with wide variety of system and cybersecurity capability and adversary actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weakness in our supply chain breach in our multi tiered supply chain could impact our data or customer deliverable we must rely on this supply chain for detecting and reporting cyber incident which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incident effectively or in timely manner because of the ongoing supply chain cyber security related threat our customer continue to seek that large prime contractor like take step to assure the cyber capability of their supply chain consequently cyber security event in our supply chain could have an adverse impact on our relationship with our customer the cost related to cyber or other security threat or disruption may not be fully insured or indemnified by other mean additionally some cyber technology we develop under contract for our customer particularly those related to homeland security may raise potential liability related to intellectual property and civil liberty including privacy concern which may not be fully insured or indemnified by other mean or involve reputational risk our enterprise risk management program includes threat detection and cybersecurity mitigation plan and our disclosure control and procedure address cybersecurity and include element intended to ensure that there is an analysis of potential disclosure obligation arising from security breach we also maintain compliance program to address the potential applicability of restriction on trading while in possession of material nonpublic information generally and in connection with cybersecurity breach if we fail to successfully complete or manage acquisition divestiture equity investment and other transaction or if acquired entity or equity investment fail to perform expected our financial result business and future prospect could be harmed in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate company and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition joint venture other investment and divestiture we seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunity that will expand or complement our existing product and service or customer base at reasonable valuation to be successful we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issue and potential loss contingency or underlying risk some of which are difficult to discover or ass prior to consummation of an acquisition or investment negotiate transaction term complete and close complex transaction integrate acquired company and employee and realize anticipated operating synergy efficiently and effectively regulator have increased their scrutiny of merger and acquisition in recent year which could continue to limit our ability to execute certain transaction that we might otherwise pursue such the termination of our proposed acquisition of aerojet rocketdyne in acquisition divestiture joint venture and investment transaction often require substantial management resource and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business unidentified or identified but uncertain liability that are not covered by indemnification or other coverage could adversely affect our future financial result this is particularly the case in respect of successor liability under procurement law and regulation such the false claim act or the truthful cost or pricing data act formerly the truth in negotiation act anti corruption environmental tax import export and technology transfer law which provide for civil and criminal penalty and the potential for debarment we also may incur unanticipated cost or expense including post closing asset impairment charge expense associated with eliminating duplicate facility employee retention transaction related or other litigation and other liability any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and result of operation joint venture and other noncontrolling investment operate under shared control with other party these investment typically face many of the same risk and uncertainty we do but may expose to additional risk not present if we retained full control joint venture partner may have economic or other business interest that are inconsistent with ours and we may be unable to prevent strategic decision that may adversely affect our business financial condition and result of of content operation we also could be adversely affected by or liable for action taken by these joint venture that we do not control including violation of anti corruption import and export taxation and anti boycott law depending on our right and percentage of ownership we may consolidate the financial result of such entity or account for our interest under the equity method under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated venture and investment we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these joint venture in our result of operation our operating result are affected by the conduct and performance of business over which we do not exercise control and result we may not be successful in achieving the growth or other intended benefit of strategic investment we make investment in certain company that we believe are advancing or developing new technology applicable to our core business and new initiative important to these investment may be in the form of common or preferred stock warrant convertible debt security or investment in fund and are generally illiquid at the time of investment which limit our ability to exit an investment or realize an investment return absent liquidity event we generally seek to exit these investment following liquidity event such public offering and expiration of any applicable lock up or other restriction subject to market condition although we may not be successful in exiting in timely manner typically we hold non controlling interest and therefore are unable to influence strategic decision by these company and may have limited visibility into their activity which may result in our not realizing the intended benefit of the investment for fund investment we have even le influence and visibility non controlling investor in fund that invests in other company we may recognize significant gain or loss attributable to adjustment of the investment fair value including impairment up to and including the full value of the investment which can be affected by the success of the company market volatility and change in valuation of our investment holding this is particularly the case for investment that involve company that have become publicly traded since change in the trading price of security we hold for investment must be marked to market in each financial reporting period risk related to significant contingency uncertainty and estimate including pension tax environmental and litigation costspension funding requirement and cost are dependent on return on pension asset and other economic and actuarial assumption which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly and affect the affordability of our product and service many of our employee and retiree participate in defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan the impact of these plan on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense or income we record for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because the calculation are sensitive to change in several key economic assumption including interest rate and rate of return on plan asset other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality well the timing of cash funding change in these factor including actual return on plan asset may also affect our plan funding cash flow and stockholder equity we could be required to make pension contribution earlier and or in excess than planned if our return on pension asset is le than our assumption which would reduce our free cash flow with regard to cash flow we have made substantial cash contribution to our plan required by the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended and expect to make future contribution required or when deemed prudent we generally can recover significant portion of these contribution related to our plan allowable cost on our government contract including fm however there is lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plan under pension funding rule and when we recover pension cost under government cost accounting standard ca which can affect the timing of our cash flow our business segment result of operation include pension expense calculated under ca while our consolidated financial statement must present pension income or expense in accordance with gaap financial accounting standard fa difference in these accounting rule may result in significant period adjustment referred to our fa ca pension adjustment in recent year we have taken action intended to mitigate the risk related to our defined benefit pension plan through pension risk transfer transaction whereby we purchase group annuity contract gacs from insurance company using asset from the pension trust we expect to continue to evaluate such transaction in the future although under the majority of the gacs we have purchased we are relieved of all responsibility for the associated pension obligation we have purchased and may in the future purchase gacs whereby the insurance company reimburses the pension plan but we remain responsible for paying benefit under the plan to covered retiree and beneficiary and are subject to the risk that the insurance company will default on it obligation to reimburse the pension trust while we believe pension risk transfer transaction are beneficial future transaction depending on their size could result in making additional contribution to the pension trust and or require to recognize noncash settlement charge in earnings in the applicable reporting period of content for more information on how these factor could impact earnings financial position cash flow and stockholder equity see critical accounting policy postretirement benefit plan in the md and note postretirement benefit plan included in our note to consolidated financial statement our estimate and projection may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our asset may be at risk of future impairment the accounting for some of our most significant activity is based on judgment and estimate which are complex and subject to many variable for example accounting for sale using the percentage of completion method requires that we ass risk and make assumption regarding future schedule cost technical and performance issue for thousand of contract many of which are long term in nature this process can be especially difficult when estimating cost for development program because of the inherent uncertainty in developing new product or technology additionally we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired business based on preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable asset acquired and liability assumed for significant acquisition we may use one year measurement period to analyze and ass number of factor used in establishing the asset and liability fair value of the acquisition date which could result in adjustment to asset and liability balance we have billion of goodwill asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet of december from previous acquisition which represents approximately of our total asset these goodwill asset are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain event or significant change in circumstance that indicate goodwill may be impaired if we experience change or factor arise that negatively affect the expected cash flow of reporting unit we may be required to write all or portion of the reporting unit related goodwill asset the carrying value and fair value of our sikorsky reporting unit are closely aligned therefore any business deterioration including the outcome of upcoming contract award contract cancellation or termination or market pressure could cause our sale earnings and cash flow to decline below current projection and could cause goodwill and intangible asset to be impaired goodwill and trademark associated with sikorsky were approximately billion of december additionally sikorsky may not perform expected or demand for it product may be adversely affected by global economic condition including oil and gas trend that are outside of our control actual financial result could differ from our judgment and estimate see critical accounting policy in the md and result of operation and note organization and significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement for complete discussion of our significant accounting policy and use of estimate change in tax law and regulation or exposure to additional tax liability could adversely affect our financial result change in federal or state or foreign tax law and regulation or their interpretation and application including those with retroactive effect could result in increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow for example beginning in the tax cut and job act of eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditure immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayer to amortize such expenditure over five year for tax purpose while the most significant impact of this provision is to cash tax liability for the tax year in which the provision took effect the impact will decline annually over the five year amortization period to an immaterial amount in year six the amount of net deferred tax asset will change periodically based on several factor including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligation actual cash contribution to our postretirement benefit plan change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax position and future change in tax law in addition we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authority including foreign tax authority the final determination of tax audit and any related litigation could similarly result in unanticipated increase in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flow our business involves significant risk and uncertainty that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance significant portion of our business relates to designing developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology product and system new technology may be untested or unproven failure of some of these product and service could result in extensive loss of life or property damage accordingly we may incur liability that are unique to our product and service in some but not all circumstance we may be entitled to certain legal protection or indemnification from our customer either through government indemnification under public law the commercial space launch act or the price anderson act qualification of our product and service by the department of homeland security under the safety act provision of the homeland security act of contractual provision or otherwise we seek to obtain insurance coverage from established and reputable insurance carrier to the extent available in order to cover these risk and liability however the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain or that is available to purchase in the market may not be adequate to cover all claim or liability insurance coverage is subject to the term and condition of the insurance contract and is further subject to any sublimits exclusion restriction or defense including standard exclusion for of content act of war existing coverage is renewed annually and may be canceled pursuant to the term of the policy while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risk natural hazard and liability for example we are limited in the amount of insurance we can obtain to cover unusually hazardous risk or certain natural hazard such earthquake fire or extreme weather condition some of which may be exacerbated by climate change we have significant operation in geographic area prone to these risk such in california florida and texas and certain of our property have suffered damage from natural disaster in the past and may in the future we could incur significant cost to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for respond to and mitigate the effect of climate change in addition under certain classified fixed price development and production contract we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property because of the classified nature of the contract and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claim to commercial insurer even if insurance coverage is available we may not be able to obtain it in an amount at price or on term acceptable to some insurance provider may be unable or unwilling to provide insurance given the nature of our business or product additionally dispute with insurance carrier over coverage term or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carrier may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash flow substantial cost resulting from an accident failure of or defect in our product or service natural catastrophe or other incident or liability arising from our product and service in excess of any legal protection indemnity and our insurance coverage or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not obtained could adversely impact our financial condition cash flow and operating result any accident failure of or defect in our product or service even if fully indemnified or insured could negatively affect our reputation among our customer and the public and make it more difficult for to compete effectively it also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future environmental cost and regulation including in relation to climate change could adversely affect our future earnings well the affordability of our product and service we are subject to federal state local and foreign requirement for the protection of the environment including those for discharge of hazardous material and remediation of contaminated site due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirement we are party to or have property subject to various lawsuit proceeding and remediation obligation these type of matter could result in fine penalty cost reimbursement or contribution compensatory or treble damage or non monetary sanction or relief we have incurred and will continue to incur liability for environmental remediation at some of our current and former facility and at third party owned site where we have been designated potentially responsible party result of our historical activity and those of our predecessor company environmental remediation activity usually span many year and the extent of financial exposure can be difficult to estimate among the variable management must ass in evaluating cost associated with these case and remediation site are the status of site assessment extent of the contamination impact on natural resource changing cost estimate evolution of technology used to remediate the site continually evolving environmental standard availability of insurance coverage and indemnification under existing agreement and cost allowability issue including varying effort by the government to limit allowability of our cost in resolving liability at third party owned site our environmental remediation related liability also could increase significantly because of acquisition the regulation of new substance stricter remediation standard for existing regulated substance change in the interpretation or enforcement of existing law and regulation or the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination or new contaminant for information regarding these matter including current estimate of the amount that we believe are required for environmental remediation to the extent probable and estimable see critical accounting policy environmental matter in the md and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency included in our note to consolidated financial statement we manage and have managed various government owned facility on behalf of the government at such facility environmental compliance and remediation cost historically have been the responsibility of the government we have relied and continue to rely with respect to past practice on government funding to pay such cost notwithstanding effort by some government representative to limit this responsibility although the government remains responsible for capital and operating cost associated with environmental compliance responsibility for fine and penalty associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the government or the contractor depending on the contract and the relevant fact some environmental law include criminal provision conviction under environmental law could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform under existing government contract the increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas ghg emission and their potential impact relating to climate change could result in law regulation or policy that significantly increase our direct and indirect operational and compliance burden which could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation these law regulation or policy could take many form including carbon tax cap and trade regime increased efficiency standard ghg reduction commitment incentive or mandate for particular type of energy or change in procurement law change in government procurement law that mandate or take into account climate change consideration such the contractor ghg emission of content ghg emission reduction target lower emission product or other climate risk in evaluating bid could result in costly change to our operation or affect our competitiveness on future bid or our ability to bid at all in addition to incurring direct cost to implement any climate change related law regulation or policy we may see indirect cost rise such increased energy or material cost result of policy affecting other sector of the economy although most of these increased cost likely would be recoverable through pricing to the extent that the increase in our cost result of these policy are greater than our competitor we may be le competitive on future bid or the total increased cost in our industry product and service could result in lower demand from our customer we monitor development in climate change related law regulation and policy for their potential effect on however we currently are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential cost associated with such development in addition climate change related litigation and investigation have increased in recent year and any claim or investigation against could be costly to defend and our business could be adversely affected by the outcome we are involved in number of legal proceeding we can not predict the outcome of litigation and other contingency with certainty our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceeding and other contingency that can not be predicted

and equity investment covid continued to cause business impact in the emergence of the omicron variant in late and resulting increase in covid case in early adversely impacted our operation and our supply chain our performance wa affected during by supply chain disruption and delay well labor challenge associated with employee absence travel restriction site access quarantine restriction remote work and adjusted work schedule the recovery from of content that disruption ha been slower than originally anticipated in particular within our supply chain and some of those supply chain impact are expected to continue into attendance for employee required to be onsite fluctuated during based on covid development we are actively engaging with our customer and are continuing to take measure to protect the health and safety of our employee in our on going effort to mitigate supply chain risk we accelerated payment of billion to our supplier of december that are due according to contractual term in future period while consistently prioritizing small business which make up over half of our active supply base well at risk business additionally we have deployed resource at supplier site to improve oversight and performance we will continue to monitor supply chain risk especially at small and at risk related supplier and may continue to utilize accelerated payment in on an needed basis the impact of covid on our operation and financial performance in future period including our ability to execute our program in the expected timeframe remains uncertain and will depend on number of factor including the impact of potential new covid variant or subvariants the effectiveness and adoption of covid vaccine and therapeutic and supplier impact and related government action to prevent and manage disease spread the long term impact of covid on government budget and other funding priority including international priority that impact demand for our product and service also are difficult to predict but could negatively affect our future result and performance inflationheightened level of inflation and the potential worsening of macro economic condition present risk for lockheed martin our supplier and the stability of the broader defense industrial base during we have experienced impact to our labor rate and supplier have signaled inflation related cost pressure which will flow through to our cost and pricing although inflation not significantly impact our financial result in if inflation remains at current level for an extended period or increase and we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact our cost are likely to increase resulting in pressure on our profit margin and cash flow particularly for existing fixed price contract for new contract proposal we are factoring into our pricing heightened level of inflation based on accepted dod escalation index and other assumption and in some case seeking the inclusion of economic price adjustment epa clause which would permit subject to the particular contractual term cost adjustment in fixed price contract for unexpected inflation in addition inflation and the increase in the cost of borrowing from rising interest rate could constrain the overall purchasing power of our customer for our product and service in particular in the near term to the extent inflation assumption are le than current inflationary pressure rising interest rate will also increase our borrowing cost on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investment while rising interest rate reduce the measure of our gross pension obligation they can also lead to decline in pension plan asset with offsetting impact on our net pension liability we remain committed to our ongoing effort to increase the efficiency of our operation and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our product and service which may in part offset cost increase from inflation conflict in ukrainerussia invasion of ukraine ha significantly elevated global geopolitical tension and security concern result we have received increased interest for some of our product and service country seek to improve their security posture particularly in europe in addition security assistance provided by the government to ukraine ha created government demand to replenish stockpile resulting in additional and potential future order for our product we are beginning to see this interest result in initiation of new contract discussion however given the long cycle nature of our business and current industry capacity we do not expect significant increase in near term sale from new contract in response to the conflict we are evaluating capacity at our operation and the supply chain to anticipate potential demand and enable to deliver critical capability in addition the government and other nation have implemented broad economic sanction and export control targeting russia which combined with the conflict have the potential to indirectly disrupt our supply chain and access to certain resource we have not however experienced significant adverse impact to date and we will continue to monitor for any impact and seek to mitigate disruption that may arise the conflict also ha increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation state and other actor we have taken step designed to enhance our defensive posture against tactic and technique associated with this increased threat portfolio shaping activitieswe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of product and service to meet the current and future need of our customer we accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activity and through acquisition divestiture and internal realignment activity we selectively pursue the acquisition of business investment and venture at attractive valuation that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customer or technology we also may explore the divestiture of of content business investment or venture that no longer meet our need or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with different owner in pursuing our business strategy we routinely conduct discussion evaluate target and enter into agreement regarding possible acquisition divestiture joint venture and equity investment renationalization of the atomic weapon establishment programon june the uk ministry of defence terminated the contract to operate the uk nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity

defense dod on december the president signed the fy omnibus appropriation act into law which provides billion in total national defense funding of which billion is for the dod base budget this reflects billion increase over the fy request for national defense spending and billion increase for the dod the fy omnibus appropriation act also provided separate and additional funding of billion for ukraine the fourth supplemental since march of bringing the total amount of supplemental funding authority provided to billion the president fy budget request is anticipated to be submitted to congress in march initiating the fy defense authorization and appropriation legislative process in addition to the fy budget process congress will have to contend with the legal limit on debt commonly known the debt ceiling the current statutory limit of trillion wa reached in january requiring the treasury department to take accounting measure to continue normally financing government obligation while avoiding exceeding the debt ceiling it is expected however the government will exhaust these measure by june if the debt ceiling is not raised the government may not be able to fulfill it funding obligation and there could be significant disruption to all discretionary program and wider financial and economic repercussion the federal budget and debt ceiling are expected to continue to be the subject of considerable congressional debate although we believe dod intelligence and homeland security program will continue to receive consensus support for increased funding and would likely receive priority if this scenario came to fruition the effect on individual program or lockheed martin can not be predicted at this time international businessa key component of our strategic plan is

be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled order of such contract management evaluates performance on our contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense consequently our discussion of business segment performance focus on net sale and operating profit consistent with our approach for managing the business this approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contract management ass the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sale and operating profit and monitor performance on our contract in similar manner through their completion we regularly provide customer with report of our cost the contract progress the cost information in the report is accumulated in manner specified by the requirement of each contract for example cost data provided to customer for product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product such wing box on an aircraft and for service would align to the type of work being performed such aircraft sustainment our contract generally allow for the recovery of cost in the pricing of our product and service most of our contract are bid and negotiated with our customer under circumstance in which we are required to disclose our estimated total cost to provide the product or service this approach for negotiating contract with our government customer generally allows for recovery of our actual cost plus reasonable profit margin we also may enter into long term supply contract for certain material or component to coincide with the production schedule of certain product and to ensure their availability at known unit price many of our contract span several year and include highly complex technical requirement at the outset of contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract and variable consideration profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk related to the technical of content schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate for further discussion on fixed price contract see note organization and significant accounting policy included in our note to consolidated financial statement we have number of program that are designated classified by the government which can not be specifically described the operating result of these classified program are

product and service provided to the government well fm contracted through the government we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied change in net sale and operating profit generally are expressed in term of volume change in volume refer to increase or decrease in sale or operating profit resulting from varying production activity level delivery or service level on individual contract volume change in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for particular contract in addition comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to favorable profit adjustment usually relate to revision in

in the final aircraft delivery from the original contract requirement and to date the royal canadian air force flight hour have been le than originally anticipated which ha impacted program revenue and the recovery of our cost under this program future sale and recovery of existing and future cost under the program are highly dependent upon achieving certain number of flight hour which could be adversely impacted by aircraft availability and performance and the availability of canadian government resource we are currently in discussion with the canadian government to potentially restructure certain contractual term and condition that may be beneficial to both party future performance issue or change in our estimate due to revised contract scope or customer requirement may affect our

classified liquidity and cash flowsas of december we had cash and cash equivalent of billion our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operation however we also have access to credit market if needed for liquidity or general corporate purpose including share repurchase this access includes our billion revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper and letter of credit to support customer advance payment and for other trade finance purpose such guaranteeing our performance on particular contract we believe our cash and cash equivalent our expected cash flow generated from operation and our access to credit market will be sufficient to meet our cash requirement and cash deployment plan over the next twelve month and beyond based on our current business plan cash received from customer either from the payment of invoice for work performed or for advance from non government customer in excess of cost incurred is our primary source of cash from operation we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer however from time to time we fund customer program pending government appropriation if we incur cost in excess of fund obligated on the contract or in advance of contract award this negatively affect our cash flow and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess cost billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type we generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost reimbursable contract which represented approximately of the sale we recorded in we are authorized to bill the cost are incurred number of our fixed price contract may provide for performance based payment which allow to bill and collect cash we perform on the contract the amount of performance based payment and the related milestone are encompassed in the negotiation of each contract the timing of such payment may differ from the timing of the cost incurred related to our contract performance thereby affecting our cash flow the government ha indicated that it would consider progress payment the baseline for negotiating payment term on fixed price contract rather than performance based payment in contrast to negotiated performance based payment term progress payment provision correspond to percentage of the amount of cost incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly cost are incurred our cash flow may be affected if the government change it payment policy or decides to withhold payment on our billing while the impact of policy change or withholding payment may delay the receipt of cash the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary to date the effect of covid have resulted in some negative impact on our cash flow partially due to supplier disruption and delay the government ha taken certain action and enacted legislation to mitigate the impact of covid on public health the economy state and local government individual and business since the pandemic began lockheed martin ha remained committed to accelerating payment to the supply chain with focus on small and at risk business of december we have accelerated billion of payment to our supplier that are due by their term in future period we will continue to monitor supply chain risk especially at small and at risk related supplier and may continue to utilize accelerated payment in on an needed basis in addition we have balanced cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technology to provide our customer with enhanced capability enhance stockholder value and position ourselves to take advantage of new business of content opportunity when they arise consistent with that strategy we have continued to invest in our business and technology through capital expenditure independent research and development and selective business acquisition and

inclusive of cost for the development or purchase of internal use software that are capitalized we use free cash flow to evaluate our business performance and overall liquidity well performance goal in our annual and long term incentive plan we believe free cash flow is useful measure for investor because it represents the amount of cash generated from operation after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholder and creditor through dividend stock repurchase and debt repayment or available to fund acquisition and other investment the entire amount of free cash flow is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditure however because it doe not account for certain mandatory expenditure such the of content repayment of maturing debt and pension contribution while management belief that free cash flow non gaap financial measure may be useful in evaluating our financial performance it should be considered supplemental to and not substitute for

related to direct material obligation to subcontractor and outsourcing arrangement total purchase obligation for operating activity in the preceding table include approximately billion related to contractual commitment entered into result of contract we have with our government customer the government generally would be required to pay for any cost we incur relative to these commitment if they were to terminate the related contract for convenience under the far subject to available funding this also would be true in case where we perform subcontract work for prime contractor under government contract the termination for convenience language also may be included in contract with foreign state and local government we also have contract with customer that do not include termination for convenience provision including contract with commercial customer the majority of our capital expenditure for and those planned for are for equipment facility infrastructure and information technology the amount above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditure to be incurred in and beyond that have been obligated under contract of december and not necessarily total capital expenditure for future period expenditure for equipment and facility infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing program across all of our business segment for example we have project underway at aeronautics to support classified development program and at rms to support our sikorsky helicopter program and we have project underway to modernize certain of our facility we also incur capital expenditure for information technology to support program and general enterprise information technology infrastructure inclusive of cost for the development or purchase of internal use software we also may enter into industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset agreement condition to obtaining order for our product and service from certain customer in foreign country these agreement are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country offset agreement may be satisfied through activity that do not require to use cash including transferring technology providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in country project and the purchase by third party our vendor of supply from in country vendor these agreement also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activity purchasing supply from in country vendor providing financial support for in country project establishment of joint venture with local company and building or leasing facility for in country operation we typically do not commit to offset agreement until order for our product or service are definitive the amount ultimately applied against our offset agreement are based on negotiation with the customer and typically require cash outlay that represent only fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement satisfaction of our offset obligation are included in the estimate of our total cost to complete the contract and may impact our sale profitability and cash flow our ability to recover investment on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligation is generally dependent upon the successful operation of of content venture that we do not control and may involve product and service that are dissimilar to our business activity at december the notional value of remaining obligation under our outstanding offset agreement totaled approximately billion which primarily relate to our aeronautics mfc and rms business segment most of which extend through to the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligation at december that also satisfy offset agreement those amount are included in the contractual commitment table above offset program usually extend over several year and may provide for penalty estimated at approximately billion at december in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirement while historically we have not been required to pay material penalty resolution of offset requirement are often the result of negotiation and subjective judgment we have entered into standby letter of credit and surety bond issued on our behalf by financial institution and we have directly issued guarantee to third party primarily relating to advance received from customer and the guarantee of future performance on certain contract letter of credit and surety bond generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform in some case we may guarantee the contractual performance of third party such joint venture partner at december we had the following outstanding letter of credit surety bond and third party guarantee in million total commitmentless year standby letter of credit surety third party total commitment approximately million of standby letter of credit in the le than year category are expected to renew for additional period until completion of the contractual obligation at december third party guarantee totaled million of which approximately related to guarantee of contractual performance of joint venture to which we currently are or previously were party these amount represent our estimate of the maximum amount we would expect to incur upon the contractual non performance of the joint venture joint venture partner or divested business generally we also have cross indemnity in place that may enable to recover amount that may be paid on behalf of joint venture partner in determining our exposure we evaluate the reputation performance on contractual obligation technical capability and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partner and the transferee under novation agreement all of which include guarantee required by the far at december and there were no material amount recorded in our financial statement related to third party guarantee or novation agreement critical accounting policiescontract accounting sale recognitionthe majority of our net sale are generated from long term contract with the government and international customer including fm contracted through the government for the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system product and service we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable for certain contract that meet the foregoing requirement primarily international direct commercial sale contract we are required to obtain certain regulatory approval in these case we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approval based upon all known fact and circumstance we provide our product and service under fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target of content incentive based on performance cost plus fixed fee contract provide fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and doe not vary with actual cost we ass each contract at it inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contract when making this determination we consider factor such whether two or more contract were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective if combined we treat the combined contract single contract for revenue recognition purpose we evaluate the product or service promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for one or more performance obligation the product and service in our contract are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationship and the significant contract management function required to perform under the contract accordingly our contract are typically accounted for one performance obligation in limited case our contract have more than one distinct performance obligation which occurs when we perform activity that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles significant judgment is required in determining performance obligation and these decision could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the performance obligation we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the product or service being provided under the contract for contract where portion of the price may vary award incentive fee and claim we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk at the inception of contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current right and do not contemplate future modification including unexercised option or follow on contract until they become legally enforceable contract are often subsequently modified to include change in specification requirement or price which may create new or change existing enforceable right and obligation depending on the nature of the modification we consider whether to account for the modification an adjustment to the existing contract or separate contract generally modification to our contract are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated task provided in the context of the contract therefore such modification are accounted for if they were part of the existing contract and recognized cumulative adjustment to revenue for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to customer on standalone basis not bundled with any other product or service our contract with the government including fm contract are subject to far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual cost plus reasonable profit margin result of these regulation the standalone selling price of product or service in our contract with the government and fm contract are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract for non government contract with multiple performance obligation we evaluate whether the stated selling price for the product or service represent their standalone selling price we primarily sell customized solution unique to customer specification when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligation we typically use the expected cost plus reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service we occasionally sell standard product or service with observable standalone sale transaction in these situation the observable standalone sale transaction are used to determine the standalone selling price we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service in determining when performance obligation are satisfied we consider factor such contract term payment term and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfer continuously to the customer for most contract with the government and fm contract this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit for most non government contract primarily international direct commercial contract continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver product that do not have an alternative use to and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reason other than our non performance we would have the right to recover damage which would include among other potential damage the right to payment for our work performed to date plus reasonable profit of content for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the performance obligation for performance obligation to provide service to the customer revenue is recognized over time based on cost incurred or the right to invoice method in situation where the value transferred match our billing right our customer receives and consumes the benefit for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point significant estimate and assumption are made in estimating contract sale cost and profit we estimate profit the difference between estimated revenue and total estimated cost to complete the contract at the outset of long term contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract well our ability to earn variable consideration and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead general and administrative and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset or localization agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk related to technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase or our estimate of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident which we refer to reach forward loss comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to favorable profit adjustment usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to unfavorable profit adjustment increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter covid impact or supply chain disruption restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset other contract accounting considerationsthe majority of our sale are driven by pricing based on cost incurred to produce product or perform service under contract with the government cost based pricing is determined under the far the far provides guidance on the type of cost that are allowable in establishing price for good and service under government contract for example cost such those related to charitable contribution interest expense and certain advertising and public relation activity are unallowable and therefore not recoverable through sale in addition we may enter into advance agreement with the government that address the subject of allowability and allocability of cost to contract for specific matter for example most of the environmental cost we incur for environmental remediation related to site operated in prior year are allocated to our current operation general and administrative cost under far provision and supporting advance agreement reached with the government of content we closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policy related to contract accounting cost incurred and allocated to contract are reviewed for compliance with government regulation by our personnel and are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency postretirement benefit plansoverviewmany of our employee and retiree participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan see note postretirement benefit plan included in our note to consolidated financial statement the majority of our accrued benefit obligation relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plan we recognize on plan by plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plan under gaap either an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the gaap benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefit we currently expect to pay to plan participant based on past service the qualified defined benefit pension plan for salaried employee are fully frozen effective january and our salaried employee participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement saving plan similar to recent year we continue to take action to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plan on our financial result by reducing the volatility of our pension obligation including entering into pension risk transfer transaction involving the purchase of group annuity contract gacs for portion of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligation using asset from the pension trust during the second quarter of we purchased gacs to transfer billion of gross defined benefit pension obligation and related plan asset to an insurance company for approximately retiree and beneficiary the gacs were purchased using asset from lockheed martin master retirement trust and no additional funding contribution wa required in connection with this transaction we recognized noncash non operating pension settlement charge of billion billion or per share after tax for the affected defined benefit pension plan in the quarter ended june which represents the accelerated recognition of actuarial loss that were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss account within stockholder equity similarly in the third quarter of we purchased gacs to transfer billion of gross defined benefit pension obligation and related plan asset to an insurance company for approximately retiree and beneficiary in connection with this transaction we recognized noncash pension settlement charge of billion billion or per share after tax during the third quarter of inclusive of the transaction described above since december lockheed martin through it master retirement trust ha purchased total contract for approximately billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligation eliminating pension plan volatility for approximately retiree and beneficiary and annually required pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc premium of approximately million per year we expect to continue to look for opportunity to manage our pension liability through additional pension risk transfer transaction in future year future transaction could result in noncash settlement charge to earnings which could be material to reporting period notwithstanding these action the impact of our postretirement benefit plan on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plan may materially change from year to year because the calculation are sensitive to change in several key economic assumption including interest rate actual rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity well the timing of cash funding actuarial assumptionsthe benefit obligation and asset of our postretirement benefit plan are measured at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event such significant plan amendment including in connection with pension risk transfer transaction settlement or curtailment the amount we record are measured using actuarial valuation which are dependent upon key assumption such discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and participant longevity the assumption we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligation of the measurement date and the calculation of fa expense in subsequent period when reassessing these assumption we consider past and current market condition and make judgment about future market trend we also consider factor such the timing and amount of expected contribution to the plan and benefit payment to plan participant we continue to use single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligation related to our defined benefit pension plan resulting in at december compared to at december of content we utilized single weighted average discount rate of when calculating our benefit obligation related to our retiree medical and life insurance plan at december compared to at december we evaluate several data point in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate including result from cash flow model quoted rate from long term bond index and change in long term bond rate over the past year part of our evaluation we calculate the approximate average yield on corporate bond rated aa or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flow the increase in the discount rate from december to december resulted in decrease in the projected benefit obligation of our qualified defined benefit pension plan of approximately billion at december we utilized an expected long term rate of return on plan asset of at both december and december the long term rate of return assumption represents the expected long term rate of return on the fund invested or to be invested to provide for the benefit included in the benefit obligation this assumption is based on several factor including historical market index return the anticipated long term allocation of plan asset the historical return data for the trust fund plan expense and the potential to outperform market index return the difference between the long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select and the actual return on plan asset in any given year affect both the funded status of our benefit plan and the calculation of fa pension expense in subsequent period although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption the average expected return over long term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption any variance each year should not by suggest that the assumption should be changed pattern of variance are reviewed over time and then combined with expectation for the future result change in this assumption are le frequent than change in the discount rate the actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plan during of billion based on an actual rate of approximately reduced plan asset more than the billion expected return based on our long term rate of return assumption our stockholder equity ha been reduced cumulatively by billion from the annual year end measurement of the funded status of postretirement benefit plan the cumulative noncash after tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial loss resulting from change in discount rate investment experience and updated longevity market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these cumulative actuarial loss will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation over an average period of approximately twenty year of december during billion of these amount along with amortization of net prior service credit were recognized component of postretirement benefit plan expense inclusive of the noncash pension settlement charge of billion the discount rate and long term rate of return on plan asset assumption we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimate and judgment change of plus or minus basis point in the discount rate assumption at december with all other assumption held constant would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of by approximately million which would result in an after tax increase or decrease in stockholder equity at the end of the year of approximately million if the discount rate at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension income for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension income projected for would change approximately million if the expected long term rate of return on plan asset assumption at december that wa used to compute the expected fa pension income for our qualified defined benefit pension plan had been basis point higher or lower with all other assumption held constant the amount of fa pension income projected for would be higher or lower by approximately million each year difference between the actual and expected long term rate of return on plan asset impact the measurement of the following year fa pension income every basis point increase decrease in return during between our actual rate of return of approximately and our expected long term rate of return increased decreased expected fa pension income by approximately million funding considerationswe made no contribution in and to our qualified defined benefit pension plan funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan is determined in manner consistent with ca and in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended along with consideration of ca and internal revenue code rule our goal ha been to fund the pension plan to level of at least determined in accordance with erisa the erisa funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plan wa approximately and of december and which is calculated on different basis than under gaap and reflects the impact of the american rescue plan act of contribution to our defined benefit pension plan are recovered over time through the pricing of our product and service on government contract including fm and are recognized in our cost of sale and net sale ca govern the extent to of content which our pension cost are allocable to and recoverable under contract with the government including fm pension cost recovery under ca occur in different period from when pension contribution are made in accordance with erisa we recovered billion in and billion in ca pension cost amount contributed in excess of the ca pension cost recovered under government contract are considered to be prepayment credit under the ca rule our prepayment credit were approximately billion and billion at december and the prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan asset environmental matterswe are party to various agreement proceeding and potential proceeding for environmental remediation issue including matter at various site where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp at december and the total amount of liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matter wa million and million we have recorded asset totaling million and million at december and for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our product and service for agency of the government discussed below the amount that is expected to be allocated to our non government contract or that is determined to not be recoverable under government contract is expensed through cost of sale we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we enter into agreement administrative consent order consent decree that document the extent and timing of some of our environmental remediation obligation we also are involved in environmental remediation activity at site where formal agreement either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligation environmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating the cost more judgmental due to for example changing remediation technology to determine the cost related to clean up site we have to ass the extent of contamination effect on natural resource the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standard we perform quarterly review of environmental remediation site and record liability and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liability have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated see the discussion under environmental matter in note organization and significant accounting policy and note legal proceeding commitment and contingency included in our note to consolidated financial statement we consider the above factor in our quarterly estimate of the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for environmental remediation activity which result in the calculation of range of estimate for each particular environmental remediation site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined given the required level of judgment and estimation it is likely that materially different amount could be recorded if different assumption were used or if circumstance were to change change in environmental standard or change in our estimate of the extent of contamination under agreement reached with the government most of the amount we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operation general and administrative cost under existing government regulation these and other environmental expenditure relating to our government business after deducting any recovery received from insurance or other prps are allowable in establishing price of our product and service result most of the expenditure we incur are included in our net sale and cost of sale according to government agreement or regulation regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement disclosed above we may record change in the amount of environmental remediation liability result of our quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site which would result in change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and charge to earnings for example if we were to determine that the liability should be increased by million the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by approximately million with the remainder recorded charge to earnings this allocation is determined annually based upon our existing and projected business activity with the government we can not reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation site with which we are involved there are number of former operating facility we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation in some case although loss may be probable it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activity because of uncertainty assessing the extent of the contamination during any particular quarter such uncertainty may be resolved allowing to estimate and recognize the initial liability to of content remediate particular former operating site the amount of the liability could be material upon recognition of the liability portion will be recognized receivable with the remainder charged to earnings which may have material effect in any particular interim reporting period if we are ultimately found to have liability at those site where we have been designated prp we expect that the actual cost of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable prps generally prps that are ultimately determined to be responsible party are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among to share on an allocated basis the cost and expense for environmental investigation and remediation under existing environmental law responsible party are jointly and severally liable and therefore we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation in the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation the statutory framework provides that we may pursue right of cost recovery or contribution from the other prps the amount we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental cost we have incurred through insurance or from other prps which we are required to pursue by agreement and government regulation goodwill and intangible assetsthe asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business intangible asset from acquired business are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program intangible asset are amortized over period of expected cash flow used to measure fair value which typically range from five to year our goodwill balance wa billion at both december and we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is our business segment level or level below the business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use both qualitative and quantitative approach when testing goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least once every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year to perform the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of amount held at the business segment and corporate level in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of that test indicated that for each of our reporting unit no impairment existed including sikorsky based on this the fair value of content of our sikorsky reporting unit exceeded it carrying value which included goodwill of billion by margin of approximately the fair value of both our sikorsky reporting unit and the indefinite lived trademark intangible asset can be significantly impacted by it performance the amount and timing of expected future cash flow contract termination change in expected future order general market pressure including government budgetary constraint discount rate long term growth rate and change in federal or state or foreign tax law and regulation or their interpretation and application including those with retroactive effect along with other significant judgment based on our assessment of these circumstance we have determined that goodwill at our sikorsky reporting unit and the indefinite lived trademark intangible asset at our sikorsky reporting unit are at risk for impairment should there be significant deterioration of projected cash flow of the reporting unit we do not currently anticipate any material impairment on our asset result of covid or inflation impairment assessment inherently involve management judgment regarding number of assumption such those described above due to the many variable inherent in the estimation of reporting unit fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill difference in assumption could have material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting unit and could result in goodwill impairment charge in future period acquired intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual impairment test and the result of that test indicated no impairment existed intangible are amortized to expense over their applicable useful life ranging from five to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired if event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of finite lived intangible may be impaired the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group carrying value if the asset group carrying amount exceed the sum of the undiscounted future cash flow we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings of content item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe maintain active relationship with broad and diverse group of and international financial institution we believe that they provide with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business we closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse development with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of and access to sufficient credit resource our main exposure to market risk relates to interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and market price on certain equity security our financial instrument that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed rate long term debt and commercial paper if issued the estimated fair value of our outstanding debt wa billion at december and the outstanding principal amount wa billion excluding unamortized discount and issuance cost of billion change in the level of interest rate would not have material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at december we use derivative instrument principally to reduce our exposure to market risk from change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate we do not enter into or hold derivative instrument for speculative trading purpose we transact business globally and are subject to risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rate we enter into foreign currency hedge such forward and option contract that change in value foreign currency exchange rate change our most significant foreign currency exposure relate to the british pound sterling the euro the canadian dollar the australian dollar the norwegian krone and the polish zloty these contract hedge forecasted foreign currency transaction in order to minimize fluctuation in our earnings and cash flow associated with change in foreign currency exchange rate we designate foreign currency hedge cash flow hedge we also are exposed to the impact of interest rate change primarily through our borrowing activity for fixed rate borrowing we may use variable interest rate swap effectively converting fixed rate borrowing to variable rate borrowing in order to hedge change in the fair value of the debt these swap are designated fair value hedge for variable rate borrowing we may use fixed interest rate swap effectively converting variable rate borrowing to fixed rate borrowing in order to minimize the impact of interest rate change on earnings these swap are designated cash flow hedge we also may enter into derivative instrument that are not designated hedge and do not qualify for hedge accounting which are intended to minimize certain economic exposure the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to highly effective hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are not highly effective if any are immediately recognized in earnings the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swap at december and wa billion and million the increase in wa designated on the additional debt we issued during the fourth quarter the aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedge at december and wa billion and billion the increase in is due to the timing of foreign denominated international contract award at december and the net fair value of our derivative instrument wa not material see note fair value measurement included in our note to consolidated financial statement unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contract would not have material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contract or our consolidated financial statement additionally we enter into foreign currency contract to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transaction we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contract would be offset by movement on the underlying transaction and therefore when taken together do not create material risk we evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transaction and only enter into agreement with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreement are executed our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many bank we regularly monitor change to counterparty credit quality well our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties we do not hold or issue derivative financial instrument for trading or speculative purpose we maintain separate trust that includes investment to fund certain of our non qualified deferred compensation plan of december investment in the trust totaled billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent asset the trust hold investment in marketable equity security and fixed income security that are exposed to price change and change in interest rate portion of the liability associated with the deferred compensation plan supported by the trust is also impacted by change in the market price of our common stock and certain market index change in the value of the liability have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of change in the value of the trust both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liability are recognized on our consolidated statement of earnings in other unallocated net and were not material for the year ended december of content we are exposed to equity market risk through certain marketable security the fair value of these marketable security wa million of december decrease in the market price of our marketable equity security of december would not have material impact on the carrying amount of these security or our consolidated financial statement many of the same factor that could result in an adverse movement of equity market price affect our non marketable equity investment although we can not always quantify the impact directly financial market are volatile which could negatively affect the valuation and prospect of the company we invest in their ability to raise additional capital and the likelihood of our ability to

our opinion on the consolidated financial statement taken whole and we are not by communicating the critical audit matter below providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which they relate of content revenue recognition based on the percentage of completion methoddescription of the matterfor the year ended december the corporation recorded net sale of billion more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statement the corporation generates the majority of it net sale from long term contract with it customer whereby substantially all of the corporation revenue is recognized over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the corporation measure progress towards completion based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the performance obligation referred to the estimate at completion analysis the corporation estimate profit on these contract the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost at completion the percentage of completion cost to cost method requires management to make significant estimate and assumption to estimate contract sale and cost associated with it contract with customer at the outset of long term contract the corporation identifies risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract throughout the contract life cycle the corporation monitor and ass the effect of those risk on it estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if the corporation successfully retires risk surrounding the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which would decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract conversely the profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase change to the profit booking rate resulting from change in estimate could have material effect on the corporation result of operation auditing the corporation estimate at completion analysis used in it revenue recognition process wa complex due to the judgment involved in evaluating the significant estimate and assumption made by management in the creation and subsequent update to the corporation estimate at completion analysis the estimate at completion analysis of each contract consider risk surrounding the corporation ability to achieve the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract how we addressed the matter in our auditwe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal control over the corporation revenue recognition process for example we tested internal control over management review of the estimate at completion analysis and the significant assumption underlying the estimated contract value and estimated total cost to complete we also tested internal control that management executes which are designed to validate the data used in the estimate at completion analysis wa complete and accurate to test the accuracy of the corporation estimate at completion analysis our audit procedure included among others comparing estimate of labor cost subcontractor cost and material to historical result of similar contract and agreeing the key term to contract documentation and management estimate we also performed sensitivity analysis over the significant assumption to evaluate the change in the profit booking rate resulting from change in the assumption defined benefit pension plan obligationdescription of the matterat december the corporation aggregate obligation for it qualified defined benefit pension plan wa billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan asset of billion resulting in net unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of billion explained in note of the consolidated financial statement the corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension asset and obligation at the end of each year or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain event the amount are measured using actuarial valuation which depend on key assumption such the discount rate auditing the defined benefit pension obligation wa complex and required the involvement of specialist result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumption such the discount rate used in the measurement process the discount rate assumption ha significant effect on the measurement of the projected benefit obligation of content how we addressed the matter in our auditwe obtained an understanding evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of relevant internal control over management measurement and valuation of the defined benefit pension obligation calculation for example we tested the internal control over management review of the defined benefit pension obligation calculation the significant actuarial assumption and the data input provided to the actuary to test the defined benefit pension obligation our audit procedure included among others evaluating the methodology used the significant actuarial assumption described above and the underlying data used by the corporation we compared the actuarial assumption used by management to historical trend and evaluated the change in the defined benefit pension obligation from prior year due to the change in service cost interest cost benefit payment settlement actuarial gain and loss longevity assumption and plan amendment in addition we involved our actuarial specialist to assist in evaluating management methodology for determining the discount rate that considers the maturity and duration of the benefit payment and is used to measure the defined benefit pension obligation part of this assessment we compared the projected cash flow to the prior year and compared the current year benefit paid to the prior year projected cash flow lastly we also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data including the participant data

operation including the entity that manages the program are no longer included in our financial result of that date therefore during awe only generated sale of million and operating profit of million which are included in space financial result for the year ended december during the year ended december awe generated sale of billion and operating profit of million which are included in space financial result for basis of presentation these consolidated financial statement include the account of subsidiary we control and variable interest entity if we are the primary beneficiary we eliminate intercompany balance and transaction in consolidation we classify certain asset and liability current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program our operating cycle which is generally longer than one year this primarily impact receivables contract asset inventory and contract liability we classify all other asset and liability based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year use of estimate we prepare our consolidated financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap in doing so we are required to make estimate and assumption that affect the amount reported in the consolidated financial statement and accompanying note we base these estimate on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making judgment about the carrying amount of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source our actual result may differ materially from these estimate significant estimate inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement include but are not limited to accounting for sale and cost recognition postretirement benefit plan environmental liability and asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery evaluation of goodwill intangible asset investment and other asset for impairment income tax including deferred income tax fair value measurement and contingency revenue recognition the majority of our net sale are generated from long term contract with the government and international customer including foreign military sale fm contracted through the government for the research design development manufacture integration and sustainment of advanced technology system product and service we account for contract when it ha approval and commitment from both party the right of the party are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable for certain contract that meet the foregoing requirement primarily international direct commercial sale contract we are required to obtain certain regulatory approval in these case we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approval based upon all known fact and circumstance we provide our product and service under fixed price and cost reimbursable contract under fixed price contract we agree to perform the specified work for pre determined price to the extent our actual cost vary from the estimate upon which the price wa negotiated we will generate more or le profit or could incur loss some fixed price contract have performance based component under which we may earn incentive payment or incur financial penalty based on our performance cost reimbursable contract provide for the payment of allowable cost incurred during performance of the contract plus fee up to ceiling based on the amount that ha been funded typically we enter into three type of cost reimbursable contract cost plus award fee cost plus incentive fee and cost plus fixed fee cost plus award fee contract provide for an award fee that varies within specified limit based on the customer assessment of our performance against predetermined set of criterion such target based on cost quality technical and schedule criterion cost plus incentive fee contract provide for reimbursement of cost plus fee which is adjusted by formula based on the relationship of total allowable cost to total of content target cost incentive based on cost or reimbursement of cost plus an incentive to exceed stated performance target incentive based on performance cost plus fixed fee contract provide fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and doe not vary with actual cost we ass each contract at it inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contract when making this determination we consider factor such whether two or more contract were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective if combined we treat the combined contract single contract for revenue recognition purpose we evaluate the product or service promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for having one or more performance obligation the product and service in our contract are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationship and the significant contract management function required to perform under the contract accordingly our contract are typically accounted for one performance obligation in limited case our contract have more than one distinct performance obligation which occurs when we perform activity that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles significant judgment is required in determining performance obligation and these decision could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in given period we classify net sale product or service on our consolidated statement of earnings based on the predominant attribute of the performance obligation we determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the product or service being provided under the contract for contract where portion of the price may vary award incentive fee and claim we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk at the inception of contract we estimate the transaction price based on our current right and do not contemplate future modification including unexercised option or follow on contract until they become legally enforceable contract are often subsequently modified to include change in specification requirement or price which may create new or change existing enforceable right and obligation depending on the nature of the modification we consider whether to account for the modification an adjustment to the existing contract or separate contract generally modification to our contract are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated task provided in the context of the contract therefore such modification are accounted for if they were part of the existing contract and recognized cumulative adjustment to revenue for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation the standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to customer on standalone basis not bundled with any other product or service our contract with the government including fm contract are subject to the federal acquisition regulation far and the price is typically based on estimated or actual cost plus reasonable profit margin result of these regulation the standalone selling price of product or service in our contract with the government and fm contract are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract for non government contract with multiple performance obligation we evaluate whether the stated selling price for the product or service represent their standalone selling price we primarily sell customized solution unique to customer specification when it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligation we typically use the expected cost plus reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service we occasionally sell standard product or service with observable standalone sale transaction in these situation the observable standalone sale transaction are used to determine the standalone selling price we recognize revenue performance obligation are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the product and service in determining when performance obligation are satisfied we consider factor such contract term payment term and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfer continuously to the customer for most contract with the government and fm contract this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clause in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay for cost incurred plus reasonable profit for most non government contract primarily international direct commercial contract continuous transfer of control to our customer is supported because we deliver product that do not have an alternative use to and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reason other than our non performance we would have the right to recover damage which would include among other potential damage the right to payment for our work performed to date plus reasonable profit of content for performance obligation to deliver product with continuous transfer of control to the customer revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation generally using the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress for our contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer we incur cost on our contract under the percentage of completion cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost to complete the performance obligation for performance obligation to provide service to the customer revenue is recognized over time based on cost incurred or the right to invoice method in situation where the value transferred match our billing right our customer receives and consumes the benefit for performance obligation in which control doe not continuously transfer to the customer we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied this coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point backlog unfulfilled or remaining performance obligation represents the sale we expect to recognize for our product and service for which control ha not yet transferred to the customer it is converted into sale in future period work is performed or delivery are made for our cost reimbursable and fixed priced incentive contract the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the term of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount the estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period in determining the estimated consideration we consider the risk related to the technical schedule and cost impact to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration periodically we review these risk and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly the risk on such contract are successfully retired the estimated consideration from customer may be reduced resulting in reduction of backlog without corresponding recognition of sale of december our ending backlog wa billion we expect to recognize approximately of our backlog over the next month and approximately over the next month revenue with the remainder recognized thereafter for arrangement with the government and fm contract we generally do not begin work on contract until funding is appropriated by the customer billing timetable and payment term on our contract vary based on number of factor including the contract type typical payment term under fixed price contract with the government provide that the customer pay either performance based payment pbps based on the achievement of contract milestone or progress payment based on percentage of cost we incur typical payment term under cost reimbursable contract with the government provide for billing of allowable cost incurred plus applicable fee on monthly or semi monthly basis for the majority of our international direct commercial contract to deliver complex system we typically receive advance payment prior to commencement of work well milestone payment that are paid in accordance with the term of our contract we perform we recognize liability for payment in excess of revenue recognized which is presented contract liability on the balance sheet the portion of payment retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligation under the contract payment received from customer in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demand that can be higher in the early stage of contract for fixed price and cost reimbursable contract we present revenue recognized in excess of billing contract asset on the balance sheet amount billed and due from our customer under both contract type are classified receivables on the balance sheet significant estimate and assumption are made in estimating contract sale cost and profit we estimate profit the difference between estimated revenue and total estimated cost to complete the contract at the outset of long term contract we identify and monitor risk to the achievement of the technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract well our ability to earn variable consideration and ass the effect of those risk on our estimate of sale and total cost to complete the contract the estimate consider the technical requirement newly developed product versus mature product the schedule and associated task the number and type of milestone event and cost material labor subcontractor overhead general and administrative and the estimated cost to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreement sometimes referred to offset or localization agreement required under certain contract with international customer the initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risk surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirement schedule and cost in the initial estimated total cost to complete the contract profit booking rate may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risk related to technical schedule and cost aspect of the contract which decrease the estimated total cost to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract conversely our profit booking rate may decrease if the estimated total cost to complete the contract increase or our estimate of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease all of the estimate are subject to change during the performance of the of content contract and may affect the profit booking rate when estimate of total cost to be incurred on contract exceed total estimate of the transaction price provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident which we refer to reach forward loss comparability of our segment sale operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by change in profit booking rate on our contract for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage of completion cost to cost method to measure progress towards completion increase in the profit booking rate typically referred to favorable profit adjustment usually relate to revision in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation that reflect improved condition on particular contract conversely condition on particular contract may deteriorate resulting in an increase in the estimated total cost to fulfill the performance obligation and reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to unfavorable profit adjustment increase or decrease in profit booking rate are recognized in the current period they are determined and reflect the inception to date effect of such change segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other item which may or may not impact sale favorable item may include the positive resolution of contractual matter cost recovery on severance and restructuring insurance recovery and gain on sale of asset unfavorable item may include the adverse resolution of contractual matter covid impact or supply chain disruption restructuring charge except for significant severance action which are excluded from segment operating result reserve for dispute certain asset impairment and loss on sale of certain asset our consolidated net profit booking rate adjustment increased segment operating profit by approximately billion in billion in and billion in these adjustment increased net earnings by approximately billion per share in and billion per share in and billion per share in we recognized net sale from performance obligation satisfied in prior period of approximately billion in both and and billion in which primarily relate to change in profit booking rate that impacted revenue we have various development program for new and upgraded product service and related technology which have complex design and technical challenge this development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimate of the cost and time required to complete the work by and our supplier many of these program have cost type contracting arrangement cost reimbursable or cost plus fee in such case the associated financial risk are primarily in reduced fee lower profit rate or program cancellation if cost schedule or technical performance issue arise however some of our existing development program are contracted on fixed price basis or include cost type contracting for the development phase with fixed price production option and our customer are increasingly implementing procurement policy such these that shift risk to contractor competitively bid program with fixed price development work or fixed price production option increase the risk of reach forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance due to the complex and often experimental nature of development program we may experience and have experienced in the past technical and quality issue during the development of new product or technology for variety of reason our development program are ongoing and while we believe the cost and fee estimate incorporated in the financial statement are appropriate the technical complexity of these program and fixed price contract structure creates financial risk estimated completion cost may exceed the current contract value which could trigger earnings charge termination provision or other financially significant exposure these program have risk for reach forward loss if our estimated cost exceed our estimated contract revenue and such loss could be significant to our financial result cash flow or financial condition any such loss are recorded in the period in which the loss is evident we have experienced performance issue on classified fixed price incentive fee contract that involves highly complex design and system integration at our aeronautics business segment and have periodically recognized reach forward loss we continue to monitor the technical requirement remaining work schedule and estimated cost to complete the program during the fourth quarter of we revised our estimated cost to complete the program by reviewing the design and system integration requirement remaining work and schedule and recorded an additional charge of approximately million based on this and the revised schedule which wa agreed to in cumulative loss were approximately million of december we will continue to monitor our performance any future change in scope and estimated cost to complete the program and may have to record additional loss in future period if we experience further performance issue increase in scope or cost growth which could be material to our financial result in addition we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement cost also referred to pre contract cost in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule and certain milestone we will monitor the recoverability of pre contract cost which could be impacted by the customer decision regarding future phase of the program we are responsible for program to design develop and construct ground based radar at our rms business segment the program ha experienced performance issue for which we have periodically recognized reach forward loss of december cumulative loss remained at approximately million we will continue to monitor our performance any future change in scope and estimated cost to complete the program and may have to record additional loss in future of content period if we experience further performance issue increase in scope or cost growth however based on the loss previously recorded and our current estimate of the sale and cost to complete the program at this time we do not anticipate that additional loss if any would be material to our financial result or financial condition research and development and similar cost we conduct research and development activity using our own fund referred to company funded or independent research and development ir and under contractual arrangement with our customer referred to customer funded to enhance existing product and service and to develop future technology cost include basic research applied research concept formulation study design development and related test activity company funded cost are allocated to customer contract part of the general and administrative overhead cost and are generally recoverable to the extent allocable to our cost reimbursable customer contract with the government these cost also may be recoverable to the extent allocable to certain fixed price incentive contract with the government customer funded cost are charged directly to the related customer contract substantially all cost are charged to cost of sale incurred company funded cost charged to cost of sale totaled billion billion and billion in and stock based compensation we issue stock based compensation award in the form of restricted stock unit rsus and performance stock unit psus that generally vest three year from the grant date and are settled in share compensation cost related to all stock based award is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award the grant date fair value of rsus is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date le discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend equivalent cash payment that are made only upon vesting the grant date fair value of psus is measured in manner similar to rsus for award that vest based on service and performance condition or using monte carlo model for award that vest based on service and market condition for all rsus we recognize the grant date fair value le estimated forfeiture compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period which is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period for psus that vest based on service and performance condition we recognize the grant date fair value le estimated forfeiture compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of award expected to ultimately vest for psus that vest based on service and market condition we recognize the grant date fair value le estimated forfeiture compensation expense ratably over the vesting period at each reporting date estimated forfeiture for all stock based compensation award and the number of psus expected to vest based on service and performance condition is adjusted income tax we calculate our provision for income tax using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on the future tax consequence attributable to temporary difference that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of asset and liability and their respective tax base well from operating loss and tax credit carry forward the provision for income tax differs from the amount currently receivable or payable because certain item of income and expense are recognized in different period for financial reporting purpose than for income tax purpose we measure deferred tax asset and liability using enacted tax rate that will apply in the year in which we expect the temporary difference to be recovered or paid we periodically ass our tax exposure related to period that are open to examination based on the latest available information we evaluate our tax position to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the internal revenue service irs or other taxing authority if we can not reach more likely than not determination no benefit is recorded if we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled we record interest and penalty related to income tax component of income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings interest and penalty were not material during or in accordance with the regulation that govern cost accounting requirement for government contract current state and local income and franchise tax are generally considered allowable and allocable cost and consistent with industry practice are recorded in operating cost and expense we generally recognize change in deferred state tax and unrecognized state tax benefit in unallocated corporate expense cash and cash equivalent cash equivalent include highly liquid instrument with original maturity of day or le receivables receivables net represent our unconditional right to consideration under the contract and include amount billed and currently due from customer receivables net are recorded at the net amount expected to be collected there were no significant impairment loss related to our receivables in or of content contract asset contract asset include unbilled amount typically resulting from sale under contract when the percentage of completion cost to cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer contract asset are recorded at the net amount expected to be billed and collected contract asset are classified current based on our contract operating cycle and include amount that may be billed and collected beyond one year due to the long cycle nature of our contract inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value the majority of our inventory represents work in process for contract where control ha not yet passed to the customer work in process primarily consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead cost in addition cost incurred to fulfill contract in advance of the contract being awarded are recorded in inventory work in process if we determine that those cost relate directly to contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable the cost generate or enhance resource that will be used in satisfying performance obligation and the cost are recoverable referred to pre contract cost pre contract cost that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized cost of sale consistent with the transfer of product and service to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract all other pre contract cost including start up cost are expensed incurred we determine the cost of other inventory such material spare and supply by using the first in first out or average cost method if event or change in circumstance indicate that pre contract cost are no longer recoverable or the utility of our inventory have diminished through damage deterioration obsolescence change in price or other cause loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs contract liability contract liability include advance payment and billing in excess of revenue recognized contract liability are classified current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on contract by contract basis net of revenue recognized at the end of each reporting period property plant and equipment property plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost the cost of plant and equipment are depreciated generally using accelerated method during the first half of the estimated useful life of the asset and the straight line method thereafter the estimated useful life of our plant and equipment generally range from to year for building and five to year for machinery and equipment no depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such asset are placed into operation we review the carrying amount of long lived asset for impairment if event or change in the fact and circumstance indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable we ass impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flow of the related asset grouping to it carrying amount if an asset is determined to be impaired we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and it carrying amount capitalized software we capitalize certain cost associated with the development or purchase of internal use software the amount capitalized are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software which range from two to year of december and capitalized software totaled million and million net of accumulated amortization of billion and billion no amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for it intended use amortization expense related to capitalized software wa million in million in and million in fair value of financial instrument we measure the fair value of our financial instrument using observable and unobservable input observable input reflect market data obtained from independent source while unobservable input reflect internal market assumption the following hierarchy classifies the input used to determine fair value into three level level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than quoted price observable by marketplace participant either directly or indirectly level unobservable input significant to the fair value measurement investment we hold portfolio of marketable security to fund our non qualified employee benefit plan portion of these security are held in common collective trust fund and are measured at fair value using net asset value nav per share practical expedient marketable security accounted for trading are recorded at fair value on recurring basis and are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet gain and loss on these investment are included in other unallocated net within cost of sale on our consolidated statement of earnings we make investment in certain company that we believe are advancing or developing new technology applicable to our business these investment may be in the form of common or preferred stock warrant convertible debt security or investment in fund most of the investment are in equity security without readily determinable fair value which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there is an observable price change or reduced for impairment if applicable investment with quoted market price in active market level are recorded at fair value at the of content end of each reporting period the carrying amount of these were million and million at december and december and are included on our consolidated balance sheet within other asset both current and noncurrent during we recorded million million or per share after tax of net loss compared to net gain of million million or per share after tax during due to change in fair value and or sale of investment which are reflected in the other non operating income net account on our consolidated statement of earnings equity method investment investment where we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet significant influence typically exists if we have to ownership interest in the investee under this method of accounting our share of the net earnings or loss of the investee is included in operating profit in other income net on our consolidated statement of earnings since the activity of the investee are closely aligned with the operation of the business segment holding the investment we evaluate our equity method investment for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such investment may be impaired if decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary loss is recorded in earnings in the current period of december and december our equity method investment totaled million and million which wa primarily composed of our investment in the united launch alliance ula joint venture our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees wa million in million in and million in of which approximately million million and million wa included in our space business segment operating profit in july we entered into an agreement to sell our ownership interest in advanced military maintenance repair and overhaul center ammroc to our joint venture partner for million result we adjusted the carrying value of our investment to the selling price of million which resulted in the recognition of noncash impairment charge of million million or per share after tax in our result of operation disclosed in goodwill and intangible asset the asset and liability of acquired business are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition goodwill represents cost in excess of fair value assigned to the underlying identifiable net asset of acquired business intangible asset from acquired business are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer program trademark customer relationship technology and other intangible asset customer program include value assigned to major program of acquired business and represent the aggregate value associated with the customer relationship contract technology and trademark underlying the associated program intangible asset are amortized over period of expected cash flow used to measure fair value which typically range from five to year we perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired such event or change in circumstance may include significant deterioration in overall economic condition change in the business climate of our industry decline in our market capitalization operating performance indicator competition reorganization of our business government budget restriction or the disposal of all or portion of reporting unit our goodwill ha been allocated to and is tested for impairment at level referred to the reporting unit which is typically level below our business segment the level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires to determine whether the operation below the business segment constitute self sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly review the operating result we may use either qualitative or quantitative approach when testing reporting unit goodwill for impairment for selected reporting unit where we use the qualitative approach we perform qualitative evaluation of event and circumstance impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment based on that qualitative evaluation if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount no further evaluation is necessary otherwise we perform quantitative impairment test we perform quantitative test for most reporting unit at least once every three year however for certain reporting unit we may perform quantitative impairment test every year for the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of reporting unit to it carrying value including goodwill if the fair value of reporting unit exceeds it carrying value goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired if the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds it fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess we generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow dcf analysis and market based valuation methodology such comparable public company trading value and value observed in recent business acquisition determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment including the amount and timing of expected future cash flow long term growth rate discount rate and relevant comparable public company earnings multiple and relevant transaction multiple the cash flow employed in the dcf analysis are based on our best estimate of future sale earnings and cash flow after considering factor such general market condition government budget existing firm order expected future order contract with supplier labor agreement change in working capital long term business plan and recent operating performance the discount rate utilized in the dcf analysis are of content based on the respective reporting unit weighted average cost of capital which take into account the relative weight of each component of capital structure equity and debt and represents the expected cost of new capital adjusted appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flow of the respective reporting unit the carrying value of each reporting unit includes the asset and liability employed in it operation goodwill and allocation of certain asset and liability held at the business segment and corporate level during the fourth quarter of and we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting unit the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill indicated that no impairment existed acquired intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired this testing compare carrying value to fair value and when appropriate the carrying value of these asset is reduced to fair value finite lived intangible are amortized to expense over the applicable useful life ranging from five to year based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit reflected by future net cash inflow we perform an impairment test of finite lived intangible whenever event or change in circumstance indicate their carrying value may be impaired lease we evaluate whether our contractual arrangement contain lease at the inception of such arrangement specifically we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit or output from the asset substantially all of our lease are long term operating lease with fixed payment term we do not have significant financing lease our right of use rou operating lease asset represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and our operating lease liability represent our obligation to make lease payment rou operating lease asset are recorded in other noncurrent asset in our consolidated balance sheet operating lease liability are recorded in other current liability or other noncurrent liability in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due date both the rou operating lease asset and liability are recognized of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payment over the lease term most of our lease do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined therefore we use discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate which is determined using our credit rating and information available of the commencement date rou operating lease asset include lease payment made at or before the lease commencement date net of any lease incentive our operating lease agreement may include option to extend the lease term or terminate it early we include option to extend or terminate lease in the rou operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these option operating lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sale on our consolidated statement of earnings we have operating lease arrangement with lease and non lease component the non lease component in our arrangement are not significant when compared to the lease component for all operating lease we account for the lease and non lease component single component additionally for certain equipment lease we apply portfolio approach to recognize operating lease rou asset and liability we evaluate rou asset for impairment consistent with our property plant and equipment policy postretirement benefit plan many of our employee and retiree participate in defined benefit pension plan retiree medical and life insurance plan and other postemployment plan collectively postretirement benefit plan obligation amount we record related to our postretirement benefit plan are computed based on service to date using actuarial valuation that are based in part on certain key economic assumption we make including the discount rate the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and other actuarial assumption including participant longevity also known mortality and health care cost trend rate each appropriate based on the nature of the plan market related value of our plan asset determined using actual asset gain or loss over the prior three year period is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gain or loss to be amortized these asset gain or loss along with those resulting from adjustment to our benefit obligation will be amortized to expense using the corridor method where gain and loss are recognized over period of year to the extent they exceed of the greater of plan asset or benefit obligation we recognize on plan by plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plan either an asset recorded within other noncurrent asset or liability recorded within noncurrent liability on our consolidated balance sheet the gaap funded status is measured the difference between the fair value of the plan asset and the benefit obligation of the plan the funded status under the employee retirement income security act of erisa amended is calculated on different basis than under gaap of content postemployment plan we record liability for postemployment benefit such severance or job training typically when payment is probable the amount is reasonably estimable and the obligation relates to right that have vested or accumulated environmental matter we record liability for environmental matter when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation at particular site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined our environmental liability are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other liability both current and noncurrent we expect to include substantial portion of environmental cost in our net sale and cost of sale in future period pursuant to government regulation at the time liability is recorded for future environmental cost we record asset for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of product and service to agency of the government regardless of the contract form cost reimbursable fixed price we continually evaluate the recoverability of our asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery by assessing among other factor government regulation our government business base and contract mix our history of receiving reimbursement of such cost and effort by some government representative to limit such reimbursement we include the portion of those environmental cost expected to be allocated to our non government contract or determined not to be recoverable under government contract in our cost of sale at the time the liability is established or adjusted our asset for the portion of environmental cost that are probable of future recovery are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet within other asset both current and noncurrent we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year derivative financial instrument derivative are recorded at their fair value and included in other current and noncurrent asset and liability on our consolidated balance sheet the classification of gain and loss resulting from change in the fair value of derivative is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and it resulting designation adjustment to reflect change in fair value of derivative attributable to highly effective hedge are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustment to the hedged item or reflected net of income tax in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings change in the fair value of the derivative that are not highly effective if any are immediately recognized in earnings note earnings per sharethe weighted average number of share outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were follows in million average common share outstanding for basic weighted average

breach of our agreement based on the mta failure to provide access to site where work must be performed and the customer furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract the mta filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default the primary damage sought by the mta are the cost to complete the contract and

million at december and most of which are recorded in other noncurrent asset on our consolidated balance sheet see note organization and significant accounting policy for more information environmental remediation activity usually span many year which make estimating liability matter of judgment because of uncertainty with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination well such factor changing remediation technology and changing regulatory environmental standard we are monitoring or investigating number of former and present operating facility for potential future remediation we perform quarterly review of the status of our environmental remediation site and the related liability and receivables additionally in our quarterly review we consider these and other factor in estimating the timing and amount of any future cost that may be required for remediation activity and we record liability when it is probable that loss ha occurred or will occur for particular site and the loss can be reasonably estimated the amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the cost to be incurred for remediation for that site we do not discount the recorded liability the amount and timing of future cash payment are not fixed or can not be reliably determined we can not reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure in all case although loss may be probable or reasonably possible in some case it is not possible at this time to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss we project cost and recovery of cost over approximately year we also pursue claim for recovery of cost incurred or for contribution to site remediation cost against other prps including the government and are conducting remediation activity under various consent decree order and agreement relating to soil groundwater sediment or surface water contamination at certain site of former or current operation under agreement related to certain

whether to regulate hexavalent chromium at the federal level and the california state water resource control board continues to reevaluate it existing drinking water standard of ppb for perchlorate if substantially lower standard are adopted for perchlorate in california or for hexavalent chromium at the federal level we expect material increase in our estimate for environmental liability and the related asset for the portion of the increased cost that are probable of future recovery in the pricing of our product and service for the government the amount that would be allocable to our non government contract or that is determined not to be recoverable under government contract would be expensed which may have material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period we
