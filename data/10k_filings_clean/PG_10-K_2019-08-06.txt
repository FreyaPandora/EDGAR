date or incomplete we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statement result of new information future event or other factor forward looking statement are inherently uncertain and investor must recognize that event could be significantly different from our expectation for more information on risk factor that could impact our result please refer to risk factor in part item of this form global economic condition our product are sold in numerous country across north america europe latin america asia and africa with more than half our sale generated outside the united state such we are exposed to and impacted by global macro economic factor and foreign government policy and foreign exchange fluctuation current macroeconomic factor remain dynamic and any cause of market size contraction such reduced gdp in commodity dependent economy greater political unrest in the middle east central eastern europe and the korean peninsula economic uncertainty related to the execution of the united kingdom exit from the european union political instability in certain latin american and asian market and overall economic slowdown could reduce our sale or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our earnings change in cost our cost are subject to fluctuation particularly due to change in commodity price transportation cost and our own productivity effort we have significant exposure to certain commodity in particular certain oil derived material like resin and paper based material like pulp and volatility in the market price of these commodity input material ha direct impact on our cost if we are unable to manage commodity and other cost fluctuation through pricing action cost saving project and sourcing decision well through consistent productivity improvement it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin and net earnings sale could also be adversely impacted following pricing action if there is negative impact on consumption of our product we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plan including outsourcing project supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization discussed later in this md in we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement project in fiscal we communicated specific element of an additional multi year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reduction and other saving if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these change there could be negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rate translation exposure relate to exchange rate impact of measuring income statement of foreign subsidiary that do not use the dollar their functional currency transaction exposure relate to the impact from input cost that are denominated in currency other than the local reporting currency and the revaluation of transaction related working capital balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency in four of the past five year including fiscal the dollar ha strengthened versus number of foreign currency leading to lower sale and earnings from these foreign exchange impact certain country experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuation like argentina russia turkey brazil china and the united kingdom have had and could continue to have significant impact on our sale cost and earnings increased pricing in response to certain fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate may offset portion of the currency impact but could also have negative impact on consumption of our product which would affect our sale and profit government policy our net earnings could be affected by change in or foreign government tax policy for example the tax act the implication and uncertainty of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposure in certain country with currency exchange import authorization and pricing control such nigeria algeria egypt and turkey further our earnings and sale could be affected by change to international trade agreement in north america and elsewhere including increase of import tariff both currently effective and future potential change change in government policy in these area might cause an increase or decrease in our sale operating margin and net earnings result of operationsthe key metric included in the discussion of our consolidated result of operation include net sale gross margin selling general and administrative cost sg other non operating item and income tax the primary factor driving year over year change in net sale include overall market growth in the category in which we compete product initiative competitive activity the level of initiative pricing and other activity by competitor marketing spending retail execution both in store and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive change in our underlying unit volume well our pricing action which can also indirectly impact volume change in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impact on sale outside the most of our cost of product sold and sg are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating cost focus primarily on relative margin rather than the absolute year over year change in total cost the primary driver of change in gross margin are input cost energy and other commodity pricing impact geographic mix for example gross margin in developed market are generally higher than in developing market for similar product product mix for example the beauty segment ha higher gross margin than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuation in situation where certain input the procter gamble companycosts may be tied to different functional currency than the underlying sale the impact of manufacturing saving project and reinvestments for example product or package improvement and to lesser extent scale impact for cost that are fixed or le variable in nature the primary component of sg are marketing related cost and non manufacturing overhead cost marketing related cost are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiency while overhead cost are variable to some extent we generally experience more scale related impact for these cost due to our ability to leverage our organization and system infrastructure to support business growth detailed discussion of the fiscal year over year change can be found in the md section in the form filed october which updated our form for the year ended june to revise disclosure to reflect the adoption of the financial accounting standard board fasb asu and for more information on the adoption of this standard refer to note to the consolidated

single digit in beauty and baby feminine family care volume decreased low single digit in grooming volume increased mid single digit in developed region and low single digit in developing region excluding the impact of acquisition and divestiture organic volume increased low single digit in developed region unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net sale by pricing had positive impact on net sale product mix had positive impact on net sale driven by the slightly higher organic growth of the skin and personal care and personal health care category and developed region all of which have higher than company average selling price organic sale grew driven by increase in organic volume operating costscomparisons percentage of net sale year ended june basis point changegross general and administrative operating earnings from continuing operation income net net earnings attributable to procter gross margin increased basis point to of net sale in gross margin benefited basis point from total manufacturing cost saving basis point net of product and packaging reinvestments basis point of positive pricing impact and basis point from lower restructuring cost these were offset by basis point decline from unfavorable product mix and other impact primarily mix within segment due to the growth of lower margin product form and the club channel in certain category and due to the disproportionate growth of the fabric care category which is one of our largest category and ha lower than company average gross margin an basis point negative impact due to higher commodity cost and basis point negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange total sg wa relatively unchanged at billion decrease in marketing spending wa offset by an increase in overhead cost and in other net operating expense sg percentage of net sale decreased basis point to reduction in marketing spending percentage of net sale were partially offset by an increase in overhead cost and other net operating expense percentage of sale marketing spending percentage of net sale decreased basis point due to the positive scale impact of the organic net sale increase reduction in agency compensation and the impact of adopting the new standard on revenue from contract with customer which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing sg expense to reduction of net sale overhead cost percentage of net sale increased basis point productivity saving and fixed cost leverage from the increased organic net sale were more than offset by the impact of inflation higher incentive compensation cost and other cost increase including the ongoing and integration related overhead cost of the merck otc acquisition other net operating expense percentage of net sale increased basis point primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transactional charge and the net impact of change in indirect tax reserve partially offset by the gain on sale of real estate in

billion the effective tax rate increased basis point to in the current year shave care impairment charge caused basis point increase in the effective tax rate there is no tax benefit related to the goodwill portion of the impairment excluding this impact the effective tax rate declined basis point primarily due to the impact of the tax cut and job act the tax act in december the tax act among other thing lowered the corporate income tax rate but also imposed one time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiary and caused to adjust our deferred tax asset and liability to the lower federal base rate of these transitional impact resulted in provisional net charge of million for the fiscal year ended june comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of billion comprised of repatriation tax and foreign withholding tax and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of billion in addition because the company ha june fiscal year end the lower corporate income tax rate wa phased in resulting in statutory federal rate of approximately for our fiscal year ended june and for our fiscal year ended june and subsequent fiscal year combined these impact reduced the current year effective tax rate by basis point consisting of basis point reduction from the impact of the lower blended federal tax rate on current year earnings versus the prior year rate and basis point reduction due to prior year transitional impact from the tax act the remaining basis point net increase in the current year income tax rate wa driven by basis point increase from unfavorable impact of geographic mix of earnings basis point increase from reduced favorable discrete impact related to uncertain tax position which netted to approximately basis point in the current year versus basis point in the prior year and basis point reduction from increased excess tax benefit of share based compensation basis point in the current year versus basis point in the prior year net earningsoperating income decreased billion or primarily due to the billion before tax impairment charge for shave care this wa partially offset by the net sale increase along with the marginal increase in gross margin and decrease in sg spending percentage of sale all of which are discussed above earnings before income tax decreased billion or to billion the reduction in operating income discussed in the preceding paragraph wa partially offset by the current year gain from the dissolution of the pgt healthcare partnership and the base year charge for the early extinguishment of debt each of which wa discussed earlier net earnings decreased billion or to billion net earnings declined le than earnings before income tax due to the above discussed reduction in income tax foreign exchange impact reduced net earnings by approximately million in due to weakening of certain currency against the dollar including those in argentina russia turkey brazil china and the united kingdom

company initiated productivity and cost saving plan to reduce cost and better leverage scale in the area of supply chain research and development marketing and overhead the plan wa designed to accelerate cost reduction by streamlining management decision making manufacturing and other work process to fund the company growth strategy in the company communicated specific element of an additional multi year productivity and cost saving program the current productivity and cost saving plan will further reduce cost in the area of supply chain certain marketing activity and overhead expense part of this plan the company incurred approximately billion in total before tax restructuring cost across and with an additional amount of approximately billion expected in this program is expected to result in additional enrollment reduction along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing process saving generated from restructuring cost are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activity the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment however we estimate that through the underlying restructuring cost incurred since approximately billion along with other non manufacturing enrollment reduction since have delivered approximately billion in annual before tax gross saving restructuring accrual of million of june are classified current liability approximately of the restructuring charge incurred in fiscal either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policy for ongoing restructuring type activity the resulting charge are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting in addition to our restructuring program we have additional ongoing saving effort in our supply chain marketing and overhead area that yield additional benefit to our operating margin refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for more detail on the restructuring program and to the operating cost section of the md for more information about the total benefit to operating margin from our total saving effort cash flow financial condition and liquiditywe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operation and to readily access capital market at competitive rate operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating need and capital expenditure excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividend other discretionary us include share repurchase and acquisition to complement our portfolio of business brand and geography necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activity the overall cash position of the company reflects our

receivable used million of cash due to increased sale and the timing of the end of the fiscal year which fell on weekend resulting in fewer the procter gamble companydays collection the number of day sale outstanding increased approximately one day versus prior year higher inventory used million of cash mainly due to inventory increase to support initiative and business growth across all segment inventory day on hand increased approximately day primarily due to initiative support and foreign exchange impact account payable accrued and other liability increased generating billion of cash this wa primarily driven by extended payment term with our supplier and an increase in fourth quarter marketing activity versus the prior year these factor along with foreign exchange drove an approximate day increase in day payable outstanding although difficult to project due to market and other dynamic we anticipate incremental cash flow benefit from the extended payment term with supplier could decline in fiscal other operating asset and liability used billion of cash primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of tax due related to the tax act repatriation charge and statutory pension contribution adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow an important measure because it is factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividend share repurchase acquisition and other discretionary investment it is defined operating cash flow le capital expenditure and excluding payment for the transitional tax resulting from the tax act and it is one of the measure used to evaluate senior management and determine their at risk compensation adjusted free cash flow wa billion in an increase of versus the prior year the increase wa primarily driven by the

our overall liquidity financial condition or the result of operation for the foreseeable future of june we not have material cash cash equivalent and marketable security balance in any country subject to exchange control that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the fund we utilize short and long term debt to fund discretionary item such acquisition and share repurchase we have strong short and long term debt rating which have enabled and should continue to enable to refinance our debt it becomes due at favorable rate in commercial paper and bond market in addition we have agreement with diverse group of financial institution that if needed should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short term financing requirement on june our short term credit rating were moody and standard poor while our long term the procter gamble company rating were moody and aa standard poor all with stable outlook we maintain bank credit facility to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an billion facility split between billion four year facility and billion day facility which expire in november and november respectively both facility can be extended for certain period of time specified in the term of the credit agreement these facility are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facility do not have cross default or rating trigger do they have material adverse event clause except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facility we have an automatically effective registration statement on form filed with the sec that is available for registered offering of short or long term debt security for additional detail on debt see note to the consolidated financial statement guarantee and other balance sheet arrangementswe do not have guarantee or other off balance sheet financing arrangement including variable interest entity which we believe could have material impact on our financial condition or liquidity contractual commitmentsthe following table provides information on the amount and payable date of our contractual commitment of june amount in millionstotal le than year year year after yearsrecorded liability total debt tax act transitional charge tax position other interest payment relating to long term pension funding purchase obligation contractual commitment represents the federal tax liability associated with the repatriation provision of the tax act doe not include any provision made for foreign withholding tax on expected repatriation the timing of those payment is uncertain of june the company consolidated balance sheet reflects liability for uncertain tax position of million including million of interest and penalty due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflow of liability for uncertain tax position beyond one year reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve month from the balance sheet date of june can not be made represents future pension payment to comply with local funding requirement these future pension payment assume the company continues to meet it future statutory funding requirement considering the current economic environment in which the company operates the company belief it cash flow are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirement the projected payment beyond fiscal year are not currently determinable primarily reflects future contractual payment under various take or pay arrangement entered into part of the normal course of business commitment made under take or pay obligation represent minimum commitment under take or pay agreement with supplier and are in line with expected usage this includes service contract for information technology human resource management and facility management activity that have been outsourced while the amount listed represent contractual obligation we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contract were canceled prior to maturity in such case we generally are able to negotiate new contract or cancellation penalty resulting in reduced payment the amount do not include other contractual purchase obligation that are not take or pay arrangement such contractual purchase obligation are primarily purchase order at fair value that are part of normal operation and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trend we do not believe such purchase obligation will adversely affect our liquidity position significant accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our financial statement in accordance with gaap there are certain accounting policy that may require choice between acceptable accounting method or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income tax certain employee benefit and goodwill and intangible asset we believe these accounting policy and others set forth in note to the consolidated financial statement should be reviewed they are integral to understanding the result of operation and financial condition of the company the company ha discussed the selection of significant accounting policy and the effect of estimate with the audit committee of the company board of director revenue the procter gamble companyour revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customer those sale predominantly contain single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at single point in time when ownership risk and reward transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotion consisting primarily of customer pricing allowance in store merchandising fund advertising and other promotional activity and consumer coupon are offered through various program to customer and consumer sale are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized incurred at the time of the sale amount accrued for trade promotion at the end of period require estimation based on contractual term sale volume and historical utilization and redemption rate the actual amount paid may be different from such estimate these difference which have historically not been significant are recognized change in management estimate in subsequent period the company adopted asu revenue from contract with customer topic on july adoption of this standard resulted in change in the timing of recognition of certain trade promotional spending see note to our consolidated financial statement income taxesour annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rate and the tax impact of item treated differently for tax purpose than for financial reporting purpose also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgment and assumption regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balance primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax position realization of net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward period which involves business plan planning opportunity and expectation about future outcome although realization is not assured management belief it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance will be realized we operate in multiple jurisdiction with complex tax policy and regulatory environment in certain of these jurisdiction we may take tax position that management belief are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational difference with the respective governmental taxing authority can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profit are earned in line with the business substance and function of the various legal entity however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concept we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer price for our various cross border transaction we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance ruling with tax authority to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance ruling reduces this uncertainty with respect to over of our global earnings we evaluate our tax position and establish liability in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income tax we review these tax uncertainty in light of changing fact and circumstance such the progress of tax audit and adjust them accordingly we have number of audit in process in various jurisdiction although the resolution of these tax position is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcome will not have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation or cash flow because there are number of estimate and assumption inherent in calculating the various component of our tax provision certain change or future event such change in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audit or earnings repatriation plan could have an impact on those estimate and our effective tax rate see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on the company income tax employee benefitswe sponsor various post employment benefit throughout the world these include pension plan both defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan and other post employment benefit opeb plan consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retiree for accounting purpose the defined benefit pension and opeb plan require assumption to estimate the projected and accumulated benefit obligation including the following variable discount rate expected salary increase certain employee related factor such turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on asset and health care cost trend rate these and other assumption affect the annual expense and obligation recognized for the underlying plan our assumption reflect our historical experience and management best judgment regarding future expectation permitted by gaap the net amount by which actual result differ from our assumption is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds of the greater of plan asset or liability portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan change such increasing or decreasing benefit for prior employee service prior service cost is deferred and included in expense on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employee expected to receive benefit the expected return on plan asset assumption impact our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plan and our primary opeb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rate of return is described in note to the consolidated financial statement for the average return on asset assumption for pension plan asset and opeb asset wa and respectively change in the rate of return of basis point for both pension and opeb asset would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million since pension and opeb liability are measured on discounted basis the discount rate impact our plan obligation and expense discount rate used for our defined benefit pension and opeb plan are based on yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality bond for which the timing and amount of cash outflow approximate the estimated payouts the procter gamble company the plan for our international plan the discount rate are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bond rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plan of represents weighted average of local rate in country where such plan exist basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million the average discount rate on the opeb plan of reflects the higher interest rate generally applicable in the which is where majority of the plan participant receive benefit basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after tax opeb expense by approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on our defined benefit pension and opeb plan goodwill and intangible assetssignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting unit and intangible asset accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialist for significant goodwill reporting unit and intangible asset the fair value estimate are based on available historical information and on future expectation we typically estimate the fair value of these asset using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flow attributable to the respective asset the valuation used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible asset for impairment are dependent on number of significant estimate and assumption including macroeconomic condition overall category growth rate competitive activity cost containment and margin progression company business plan and the discount rate applied to cash flow indefinite lived intangible asset and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset occurs during the month ended december assumption used in our impairment evaluation such forecasted growth rate and cost of capital are consistent with internal projection and operating plan we believe these estimate and assumption are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participant unanticipated market or macroeconomic event and circumstance may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimate and assumption for example future change in the judgment assumption and estimate that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset including discount and tax rate or future cash flow projection could result in significantly different estimate of the fair value in addition change to or failure to achieve business plan or deterioration of macroeconomic condition could result in reduced cash flow or higher discount rate leading to lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible asset of these business we test individual indefinite lived intangible asset by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible asset the test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is two step process in the first step step one we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is le than it carrying value we perform second step step two to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill the second step of the impairment analysis requires valuation of reporting unit tangible and intangible asset and liability in manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in business combination the difference between the step one fair value and the amount allocated to the asset and liability in step two is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill if this implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is le than it carrying value that difference represents an impairment determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible asset are expected to have indefinite life based on their history and our plan to continue to support and build the acquired brand other acquired intangible asset certain brand all customer relationship patent and technology are expected to have determinable useful life our assessment to brand that have an indefinite life and those that have determinable life is based on number of factor including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycle operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the country in which the brand are sold determinable lived intangible asset are amortized to expense over their estimated life an impairment assessment for determinable lived intangible is only required when an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable most of our goodwill reporting unit are comprised of combination of legacy and acquired business and result have fair value cushion that at minimum exceed two time their underlying carrying value certain of our goodwill reporting unit in particular shave care and appliance are comprised entirely of acquired business and result have fair value cushion that are not high the appliance wholly acquired reporting unit ha fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value previously disclosed the fair value of the shave care reporting unit and the related gillette indefinite lived intangible asset have been reduced during the recent year to amount that approximated carrying value the fair value reduction were due in large part to significant currency devaluation in number of country relative to the dollar deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habit primarily in the developed market and an increased competitive market environment in the and certain other market which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projection the business continued to be impacted by these factor during the quarter ended june which reduced previous estimate of earnings for both fiscal and fiscal because of this we performed our step one impairment test for these asset of june and determined that the fair value have been reduced below their respective carrying value therefore we conducted step two test of goodwill for the shave care reporting unit step two requires that we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to identifiable asset and the procter gamble companyliabilities of the reporting unit including previously amortized or unrecognized intangible asset any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense the step two test resulted in an implied fair value of the shave care goodwill that wa below the carrying value therefore we recognized non cash before and after tax impairment charge of billion the resulting carrying value of the shave care goodwill is billion of june result of the methodology used in the step two testing the shave care fair value now exceeds the carrying value by approximately this is primarily due to higher estimated fair value for certain fixed asset and defined lived intangible asset both of which have been partially amortized subsequent to their initial acquisition along with fair value assigned to intangible asset not eligible for recognition in the financial statement the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset impairment charge wa billion billion after tax this charge wa equal to the difference between it estimated fair value calculated in step one and it carrying value the resulting carrying value of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is billion of june which is equal to it estimated fair value result the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is more susceptible to future impairment risk the shave care goodwill and gillette indefinite lived asset impairment charge are presented separate line item in the consolidated statement of earnings irrespective of these impairment charge the shave care business ha consistently generated significant earnings and cash flow and will continue to be strategic business for the company with attractive earnings cash flow and growth opportunity the most significant assumption utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset are the net sale and earnings growth rate including residual growth rate and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter term business planning period and approximates expected long term category market growth rate the net sale and earnings growth rate are dependent on overall market growth rate the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rate business activity that impact market share and input cost fluctuation result these growth rate could be adversely impacted by sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit change an increased competitive environment increase in input cost or devaluation of currency against the dollar spot rate of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimate for cash flow outside the the discount rate which is consistent with weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participant is based upon industry required rate of return including consideration of both debt and equity component of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse change in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt market or other country specific factor such further devaluation of currency against the dollar while management can and ha implemented strategy to address these event change in operating plan or adverse change in the future could reduce the underlying cash flow used to estimate fair value and could result in decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charge of the reporting unit goodwill and indefinite lived intangible the table below provides sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset utilizing reasonably possible change in the assumption for the shorter term and residual growth rate and the discount rate to demonstrate the potential impact to the estimated fair value the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impact related to basis point increase to discount rate or basis point decrease to our shorter term and residual growth rate both of which would result in incremental impairment charge to the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset approximate percent change in estimated fair value bps discount rate bpsgrowth rateshave care goodwill reporting unit gillette indefinite lived intangible asset see note to the consolidated

currency exchange rate movement on our investment in foreign operation these currency interest rate swap are designated hedge of the company foreign net investment based on our interest rate exposure of and during the year ended june including derivative and other instrument sensitive to interest rate we believe near term change in interest rate at confidence level based on historical interest

throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expense of movement in currency exchange rate corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operation we primarily use forward contract and currency swap with maturity of le than month based on our currency rate exposure on derivative

would not materially affect our financial statement commodity price exposure on financial instrument we use raw material that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply condition political and economic variable and other unpredictable factor we may use future option and swap contract to manage the volatility related to the above exposure of and during the year ended june and

component of net defined benefit cost previously reported in cost of product sold and sg in other non operating income net on july we adopted asu statement of cash flow restricted cash topic this guidance requires the statement of cash flow to present change in the total of cash cash equivalent and restricted cash prior to the adoption of this asu the relevant accounting guidance did not require the statement of cash flow to include change in restricted cash we currently have no significant restricted cash balance historically we had restricted cash balance and change related to divestiture activity such balance were presented current asset held for sale on the balance sheet with change presented investing activity on the statement of cash flow in accordance with asu such

accumulated other comprehensive income loss aoci to retained earnings asu is effective for fiscal year beginning after december including interim period within those fiscal year with early adoption permitted the reclassification from the adoption of this standard resulted in an increase of to retained earnings and decrease of to aoci on july we adopted asu income tax topic intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory we adopted this standard on modified retrospective basis the standard eliminates the prohibition in asc against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effect of intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory the adoption of asu did not have material impact on our consolidated financial statement including the cumulative effect adjustment required upon adoption in february the fasb issued asu lease topic the standard requires lessee to recognize lease asset and lease liability on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosure about leasing arrangement in july the fasb issued asu lease topic targeted improvement the updated guidance provides an optional transition method which allows for the application of the standard of the adoption date with no restatement of prior period amount we plan to adopt the standard on july under the optional transition method described above we are currently in the process of implementing lease accounting software well assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statement the impact of the standard will consist primarily of balance sheet gross up of our operating lease to show equal and offsetting lease asset and lease liability subject to the completion of our assessment we expect the adoption of the standard to result in an increase to our total asset of approximately in january the fasb issued asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring goodwill impairment to be measured using single step impairment model whereby the impairment equal the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting unit in their entirety this eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires company to first estimate the fair value of all asset in reporting unit and measure impairment based on those fair value and residual measurement approach it also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we will adopt the standard no later than july the impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific fact and circumstance of future individual impairment if any no other new accounting

intangible are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and underlying indefinite lived intangible asset to their respective carrying value we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these asset which is based on forecast of the expected future cash flow attributable to the respective asset significant estimate and

and circumstance may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimate and assumption during fiscal we determined that the estimated fair value of our shave care reporting unit wa le

the reporting unit including previously unrecognized intangible asset any residual fair value after this allocation is compared to the goodwill balance and any excess goodwill is charged to expense we also determined that the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset wa le than it carrying amount result we recorded non cash impairment charge for both item previously disclosed the fair value of the shave care reporting unit and the related gillette indefinite lived intangible asset have been reduced in recent year including further reduction during the year and quarter ending june these reduction were due in large part to significant currency devaluation in number of country relative to the dollar deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habit primarily in the developed market and an increased competitive market environment in the and certain other market which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projection non cash before and after tax

billion additionally non cash before tax impairment charge of billion billion after tax wa recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset to it estimated fair value of june following the impairment charge the carrying value of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is billion we believe the estimate and assumption utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participant however actual event and result could differ substantially from those used in our valuation to the extent such factor result in failure to achieve the level of projected cash flow initially used to estimate fair value for purpose of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of

activity and fair value measurementsas multinational company with diverse product offering we are exposed to market risk such change in interest rate currency exchange rate and commodity price we evaluate exposure on centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting to the extent we choose to manage volatility associated with the net exposure we enter into various financial transaction that we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instrument and hedging activity these financial transaction are governed by our policy covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument type and other hedging practice if the company elect to do so and if the instrument meet certain specified accounting criterion management designates derivative instrument cash flow hedge fair value hedge or net investment hedge we record derivative instrument at fair value and the accounting for change in the fair value depends on the intended use of the derivative the resulting designation and the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk exposure it is designed to hedge we generally have high degree of effectiveness between the exposure being hedged and the hedging instrument credit risk managementwe have counterparty credit guideline and normally enter into transaction with investment grade financial institution to the extent commercially viable counterparty exposure are monitored daily and downgrade in counterparty credit rating are reviewed on timely basis we have not incurred and do not expect to incur material credit loss on our risk management or other financial instrument substantially all of the company financial instrument used in hedging transaction are governed by industry standard netting and

of the arrangement the aggregate fair value of the instrument covered by these contractual feature that are in net liability position of june wa not material the company ha not been required to post collateral result of these contractual feature interest rate risk managementour policy is to manage interest cost using mixture of fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage this risk in cost efficient manner we enter into interest rate swap whereby we agree to exchange with the counterparty at specified interval the difference between fixed and variable interest amount calculated by reference to notional amount we designate certain interest rate swap that meet specific accounting criterion fair value hedge for fair value hedge the change in the fair value of both the hedging instrument and the underlying debt obligation are immediately recognized in earnings historically we had certain interest amount in million of dollar except per share amount or otherwise specified the

hedge in certain case we enter into non qualifying foreign currency contract to hedge certain balance sheet item subject to revaluation the change in fair value of these instrument and the underlying exposure are both immediately recognized in earnings to manage exchange rate risk related to our intercompany financing we primarily use forward contract and currency swap the change in fair value of these non qualifying instrument is immediately recognized in earnings substantially offsetting the foreign currency mark to market impact of the related exposure historically we had utilized foreign currency swap to offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuation on intercompany loan denominated in foreign currency these swap were accounted for cash flow hedge for the year ended june and we did not have any such contract outstanding net investment hedgingwe hedge certain net investment position in foreign subsidiary to accomplish this we either borrow directly in foreign currency and
