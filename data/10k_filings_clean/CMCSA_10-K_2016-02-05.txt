well with all other advertising platform such digital radio and print medium the willingness of advertiser to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating at our cable network broadcast television network and owned local broadcast television station decline in advertising revenue also can be caused by increased competition for the leisure time of audience and

comcast annual report on form table of content legislation and regulation the communication act of amended the communication act and fcc regulation and policy affect significant aspect of our business our business are also subject to other regulation by federal state local and foreign authority and to agreement we enter into with local cable franchising authority in addition we must comply with the

the nbcuniversal consent decree which contain condition and commitment of varying duration ranging from three to seven year after september legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes change existing statute rule or regulation or interpretation of existing statute rule or regulation or prescribe new one any of which may significantly affect our business in addition the fcc and certain state are becoming more active in considering rulemakings and legislation well in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant for example in february the fcc adopted new open internet regulation that reclassify broadband internet access service telecommunication service and subject it to certain common carrier regulation under title ii of the communication act in addition in february the fcc preempted certain state law that restricted municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network see cable communication segment high speed internet service below congress also is expected to consider proposal to address communication issue including whether it rewrite the entire communication act to account for change in the communication marketplace whether it should address the fcc authority to implement or enforce open internet regulation and whether it should modify rule relating to cable distribution of local broadcast television station we are unable to predict the effect of any of these or any other further regulatory or legislative requirement on our business the following paragraph summarize material existing and potential future legal and regulatory requirement affecting our business although reference should be made to the communication act fcc regulation the nbcuniversal order the nbcuniversal consent decree and other legislation and regulation for further information cable communication segment video service program carriage cable operator and other multichannel video provider are prohibited from requiring financial interest in or exclusive distribution right for video programming network condition of carriage fcc regulation well the nbcuniversal order also prohibit from unreasonably restraining the ability of an unaffiliated video programming network to compete fairly by discriminating the network on the basis of it non affiliation in the selection term or condition for it carriage the fcc is considering proposal to further expand program carriage regulation that may be disadvantageous to we have been involved in program carriage dispute at the fcc in the past and may be subject to complaint in the future must carry retransmission consent cable operator are required to carry without compensation programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television station an alternative to this must carry requirement local broadcast television station may choose to negotiate with the cable operator for retransmission consent under which the station give up it must carry right and instead seek to negotiate carriage comcast annual report on form table of content agreement with the cable operator which frequently will involve payment to the station we currently pay certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of the station broadcast programming to our video service customer and expect to continue to be subject to demand for increased payment and other concession from local broadcast television station the fcc ha initiated rulemaking to review aspect of these rule for information on must carry and retransmission consent issue relating to our broadcast television business see nbcuniversal segment broadcast television below and refer to the must carry retransmission consent discussion within that section pricing and packaging in the fcc revised it rate regulation to create presumption that all local community are subject to effective competition and should no longer be subject to rate regulation that limit price cable operator may charge for basic video service equipment and installation that decision ha been appealed in federal court the fcc accepted certification from massachusetts franchising authority that demonstrated an absence of effective competition in number of the community we serve in massachusetts and that will allow for continued rate regulation in those community all of the other area we serve except for relatively small number where we have petition for effective competition still pending at the fcc are covered by the fcc presumption and are unregulated cable equipment the communication act includes provision aimed at promoting the retail availability of set top box and other equipment that can be used to receive digital video service prior to december multichannel video provider were prohibited from deploying set top box that performed both channel navigation and security function most of our set top box relied on separate security device known cablecard congress repealed this prohibition so we may now deploy set top box with integrated security congress also directed the fcc to establish working group to report on software based security aimed at promoting the retail availability of video device in the wake of that report which wa issued in august some have proposed that the fcc replace the cablecard requirement with new technology mandate on multichannel video provider to enable retail video device to work on any multichannel video provider system the chairman of the fcc proposed such technology mandate in january and announced that the fcc plan to open rulemaking to consider the proposal if implemented this proposal would impose substantial cost on impair our ability to innovate and have other significant adverse effect on our business pole attachment the fcc regulates the rate term and condition that most pole owning utility company charge cable operator and telecommunication carrier including broadband internet access service provider such for allowing attachment to their pole state are permitted to preempt fcc jurisdiction and regulate the rate term and condition of attachment and many state in which we operate have done so most of these state have generally followed the fcc pole attachment rate standard which set rate for telecommunication service pole attachment to level at or near the rate for cable service attachment in november the fcc eliminated the ability of utility company to justify higher rate for telecommunication service pole attachment cable operator had requested this fcc action the fcc new open internet regulation described below reclassified internet access service telecommunication service which could have allowed for higher rental rate to be applied to majority of our pole attachment the fcc order ensuring that pole rate for telecommunication service attachment approximate the cable service pole rate is expected to be challenged in court by the utility company franchising cable operator generally operate their cable system under nonexclusive franchise granted by local or state franchising authority while the term and condition of franchise vary materially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction franchise typically last for fixed term obligate the franchisee to pay franchise fee and meet comcast annual report on form table of content service quality customer service and other requirement and are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision franchising authority also may establish reasonable requirement for public educational and governmental access programming and some of our franchise require substantial channel capacity and financial support for this programming the communication act also contains provision governing the franchising process including renewal procedure designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denial of renewal we believe that our franchise renewal prospect are generally favorable but can not guarantee the future renewal of any individual franchise approximately half of the state in which we operate provide for statewide franchising or have simplified local franchising requirement for new entrant some allow new entrant to operate on more favorable term than our current operation for instance by not requiring that the new entrant provide service to all part of the franchise area or permitting the new entrant to designate only those portion it wish to serve certain state allow incumbent cable operator such to opt in to the new state franchise immediately or later competing state franchise ha been issued although even in those state incumbent cable operator may be required to retain certain franchise obligation that are more burdensome than the new entrant state franchise high speed internet service we provide high speed internet service to our customer many of these service are subject to number of regulatory obligation described below including open internet regulation implemented by the fcc and certain common carrier regulation under title ii of the communication act an internet service provider isp we are also subject to requirement to implement certain network capability to assist law enforcement in conducting surveillance of person suspected of criminal activity open internet regulation in february the fcc reclassified broadband internet access service telecommunication service subject to new open internet regulation and certain common carrier regulation under title ii of the communication act including requirement that isps charge and practice for and in connection with broadband internet access service be reasonable and not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory however the fcc also refrained from implementing number of utility style regulation that might otherwise apply under title ii such rate regulation tariff and unbundling requirement the new open internet regulation bar isps from blocking access to lawful content application service or non harmful device prohibit isps from impairing or degrading lawful internet traffic on the basis of content application or service or impairing or degrading the use of non harmful device prohibit isps from favoring lawful traffic from one provider of internet content application or service called an edge provider over lawful traffic of another edge provider in exchange for consideration no paid prioritization establish new general conduct standard that prohibits isps from unreasonably interfering with or unreasonably disadvantaging the ability of consumer to select access and use the lawful internet content application service or device of their choosing or of edge provider to make lawful content application service or device available to consumer and require isps to disclose information regarding network management performance and commercial term of the service in addition interconnection arrangement which govern internet traffic is exchanged between high speed internet network and provide direct dedicated interconnection capacity to edge provider will now be subject to fcc oversight under title ii of the communication act all of these regulation are subject to fcc enforcement and could give rise to third party claim for damage or equitable relief these new requirement could adversely affect our business although the extent to which they do so will depend upon the manner in which the fcc interprets and enforces them the fcc new open internet regulation have been appealed in federal court state also may attempt to use the fcc open internet decision to justify imposing new regulation or tax and fee on isps that could adversely affect our business comcast annual report on form table of content separate and apart from the fcc new open internet regulation we committed to be bound by the fcc original open internet regulation adopted in condition of the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree although we did not agree to be bound by any future open internet regulation result among other thing we can not block access to lawful internet content application service or non harmful device or unreasonably discriminate in transmitting lawful internet network traffic although we may engage in reasonable network management municipally owned broadband network number of state have enacted law that restrict or prohibit local municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network municipal broadband provider in tennessee and municipality in north carolina requested that the fcc preempt state law that restrict their ability to provide broadband internet access service and in february the fcc preempted the tennessee and north carolina law in most respect and expressed willingness to entertain similar preemption request the fcc decision ha been appealed in federal court definition of advanced telecommunication capability in january the fcc redefined what connection speed and other service characteristic constitute advanced telecommunication capability increasing the downstream speed from mbps to mbps the definition of advanced telecommunication capability ha been used by the fcc in the past to determine whether broadband internet access service are being deployed to all american in reasonable and timely manner and if they are not being so deployed the fcc may adopt new regulation that could conceivably accelerate deployment of such service the fcc relied in part on this authority to adopt it new open internet regulation nbcuniversal order consent decree condition the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree include various condition and commitment requiring to expand our broadband service area to continue to offer all of our broadband internet access service speed tier on standalone basis at reasonable market based price to maintain broadband internet access service of at least mbps downstream across most of our footprint and to avoid discrimination in how we treat specialized service defined service we provide over the same last mile facility our broadband internet access service but not including our broadband internet access service video service or voice service voice service we provide voice service using interconnected voip technology the fcc ha adopted number of regulation for provider of nontraditional voice service such ours including regulation relating to privacy of customer proprietary network information local number portability duty and benefit disability access law enforcement assistance outage reporting rural call completion reporting universal service fund contribution obligation domestic discontinuance requirement and certain regulatory filing requirement the fcc ha not yet ruled on whether interconnected voip service should be classified an information service or telecommunication service under the communication act the classification determination is important because telecommunication service are regulated more extensively than information service unless and until the fcc definitively classifies interconnected voip service state regulatory commission and legislature will continue to investigate imposing regulatory requirement on our voice service and the fcc new open internet regulation reclassifying internet access telecommunication service may further encourage state level regulatory action voice interconnection because the fcc ha not determined the appropriate classification of our voice service provider of voip service typically either secure clec authorization or obtain interconnection to traditional wireline phone comcast annual report on form table of content company network by contracting with an existing clec which ha the right telecommunication carrier to request and obtain interconnection with the traditional wireline phone company we have arranged for such interconnection right through affiliated clecs if regulatory or judicial authority were to deny our ability to interconnect through one of our affiliated clecs our ability to provide voice service and compete in the area in question would be negatively impacted the fcc regulates the arrangement by which telecommunication carrier compensate one another for exchanged traffic and ha affirmed the right of clecs to collect intercarrier compensation when providing interconnection for voip provider in the fcc sought comment on petition that raise issue concerning the interconnection obligation for voip provider further massachusetts state commission is reviewing whether ip interconnection agreement should be subject to regulation and other state could follow universal service federal program known the universal service program generally requires telecommunication service provider to pay fee based on revenue from their service into fund used to subsidize the provision of telecommunication service in high cost area and to low income consumer and the provision of internet and telecommunication service to school library and certain health care provider some state also have analogous program that support service in high cost area or to low income consumer the fcc ha long considered implementing change to the universal service program such changing the fee calculation from revenue based formula to per user fee or per connection fee adopting fee based on bandwidth and expanding the service subject to the fee to include broadband internet access service in the fcc referred the question of how to reform universal service fee to joint federal and state commission which wa expected to make recommendation in but ha not yet done so the fcc recently ha shifted it focus away from supporting traditional telephone service and toward subsidizing broadband deployment this shift could assist some of our competitor for example in the fcc substantially revised the program that provides universal service support for service to school and library to shift support from voice service to broadband service and the deployment of wi fi network nbcuniversal segment cable network program access the communication act and fcc regulation the program access rule generally prevent cable network affiliated with cable operator from favoring cable operator over competing multichannel video programming distributor mvpds the fcc is considering whether certain online video distributor ovds should be classified mvpds which would give them the ability to bring complaint under the program access rule the fcc and congress also have considered proposal that would require company that own multiple cable network to make each of their network available individually when negotiating distribution agreement with multichannel video provider and potentially with ovds we currently offer our cable network both on bundled basis and when requested individually under the term of the nbcuniversal order mvpds can invoke commercial arbitration for access in certain circumstance to our cable network and broadcast television network including our regional sport network in addition under the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree we

addition the nbcuniversal order includes certain commitment and condition related to child television and advertising directed at child broadcast television licensing local broadcast television station may be operated only in accordance with license issued by the fcc upon finding that the grant of the license will serve the public interest convenience and necessity the fcc grant broadcast television station license for specific period of time which may be renewed with or without condition substantially all of our broadcast television station license have pending application for renewal although our station authority to operate is automatically extended while renewal application is under review several of these application have been opposed by third party and other application are pending although our license have been renewed in the past there can be no assurance that we will always obtain them ownership limit fcc regulation limit the ability of individual and entity to have attributable interest specific ownership level in local television station and place limitation on ownership of other specified mass medium entity such limit on the cross ownership of broadcast station and newspaper in the same market the fcc is reviewing the ownership regulation detailed below in local television ownership under fcc regulation licensee generally may own up to two broadcast television station in the same dma long at least one of the station is not among the top four ranked station in the market based on audience share and there are at least eight independently owned and operating full power broadcast television station in the market without regard to the number of remaining independently owned television station ownership of more than one television station within the same dma is permitted so long certain signal contour of the station involved do not overlap national television ownership the communication act and fcc regulation limit the number of broadcast television station one entity may own or control nationally no entity may have an attributable interest in broadcast television station that reach in the aggregate more than of all television household our owned television station reach doe not exceed this limit the fcc is considering eliminating rule that currently affords uhf station channel and above discount in calculating the extent of an individual station owner holding under the national cap which if adopted would place closer to the national cap and limit our flexibility to acquire station in the future foreign ownership the communication act generally limit foreign ownership in broadcast station to direct ownership and indirect ownership although the limit on indirect ownership can be waived if the fcc find it to be in the public interest for many decade the fcc declined to waive the indirect limit in broadcast transaction but since it ha been willing to consider such waiver request comcast annual report on form

also is considering legislation that would eliminate or modify the must carry and retransmission consent regime under condition imposed in the nbcuniversal order multichannel video provider may invoke commercial arbitration to resolve dispute regarding carriage of our owned local broadcast television station internet distribution the nbcuniversal order and nbcuniversal consent decree establish certain obligation and restraint concerning distribution of our content online we must make available certain of our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment programming to bona

linear video programming network to customer with broadband internet connection multichannel video provider under fcc rule to ensure that ovds have program access right to video programming from vertically integrated cable programmer and the right to force local television broadcast station to negotiate to license their content the fcc also ha proposed potentially excusing these entity from

our cable communication segment operating margin or to compete successfully in the future in addition some of our phone company competitor have their own wireless facility and may expand their service offering to include bundled wireless offering because we do not have our own wireless facility our inability to provide competitive wireless product part of our bundled cable service offering could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation each of nbcuniversal business also face substantial and increasing competition from provider of similar type of content well from other form of entertainment and recreational activity nbcuniversal must compete to obtain talent programming and other resource required in operating these business all of our business ability to compete effectively depends on our perceived image and reputation among our various constituency including our customer consumer advertiser investor and government authority our ability to compete may be negatively affected if we do not provide our customer with satisfactory customer experience there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or new competitor or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our business for more detailed description of the competition facing our business see item business and refer to the competition discussion within that section change in consumer behavior driven by alternative method for viewing content may adversely affect our business and challenge existing business model alternative product and service for the distribution sale and viewing of content have been and will likely continue to be developed that further increase the number of competitor that all our business face and challenge existing business model these product and service are also driving change in consumer behavior consumer seek more control over when where and how they consume content and access communication service comcast annual report on form table of content while our cable communication business is attempting to adapt to changing consumer behavior for example by deploying our platform and cloud dvr technology product and service have emerged that compete with our video service including those that offer subscription video on demand service or the ability to download content that can be viewed on television set computer smartphones and tablet some of these product and service charge no fee or lower fee than our traditional video package for access to their content which adversely affect demand for our video service including for expanded digital video package premium network and our dvr and on demand service the increased availability of these product and service including some that also offer high quality original video programming that is exclusive to that service have contributed to an increased number of entertainment choice available to consumer which intensifies audience fragmentation additionally the increased availability of dvrs and cloud based recording service and video on demand service reduces the viewing of content through traditional linear television distribution outlet reduced viewing of our content through traditional linear television distribution outlet ha caused and will likely continue to cause audience rating decline for nbcuniversal linear television content and may adversely affect the price and amount of advertising that advertiser are willing to purchase from and the amount nbcuniversal receives for distribution of it content additionally several company now offer smaller package of channel directly to customer over the internet at price point lower than our standard package which could adversely affect demand for our video service and reduce the subscription revenue that our cable network or broadcast television business receive from multichannel video provider these smaller package could also cause our cable communication business to offer more customized programming package that may be le profitable the success of any of these ongoing and future development or our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitor or change in consumer behavior including among younger consumer could have an adverse effect on our competitive position business and result of operation decline in advertiser expenditure or change in advertising market could negatively impact our business our cable communication cable network and broadcast television business compete for the sale of advertising time with other television network and station well with all other advertising platform such radio print and increasingly digital medium we derive substantial revenue from the sale of advertising and decline in expenditure by advertiser including through traditional linear television distribution model could negatively impact our result of operation decline can be caused by the economic prospect of specific advertiser or industry increased competition for the leisure time of audience and audience fragmentation by the growing use of new technology or the economy in general in addition advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from may be adversely affected by lower audience rating which some of our network have experienced and likely will continue to experience advertising sale and rate also are dependent on audience measurement methodology and could be negatively affected if methodology do not accurately reflect actual viewership level for example certain method of viewing content such delayed viewing on dvrs or viewing content online might not be counted in audience measurement or may generate le if any revenue than traditional distribution method which could have an adverse effect on our advertising revenue reduction in advertiser expenditure could adversely affect our revenue and business our business depend on keeping pace with technological development our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt and leverage new and existing technology and our competitor use of certain type of technology and equipment may provide comcast annual report on form table of content them with competitive advantage for example some company and municipality are building advanced fiber based network that provide very fast internet access speed and wireless internet technology continue to evolve rapidly to allow for greater speed and reliability we expect other advance in communication technology to occur in the future if we choose technology or equipment that is not effective or attractive to consumer that employed by our competitor if we fail to employ technology desired by consumer before our competitor do so or if we fail to execute effectively on our technology initiative our business and result of operation could be adversely affected we also will continue to incur additional cost we execute our technology initiative such the deployment of docsis set top box wireless gateway and cloud dvr technology and there can be no assurance that we can execute on these and other initiative in manner sufficient to grow or maintain our revenue or to compete successfully in the future we also may incur increased cost if change in the product and service that our competitor offer require that we offer certain of our existing service or enhancement at lower or no cost to our customer or that we make additional research and development expenditure we are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authority which may impose additional cost and restriction on our business federal state and local government extensively regulate the video and voice service industry and more recently internet service we expect that legislative enactment court action and regulatory proceeding will continue to clarify and in some case may adversely affect the right and obligation of cable operator and other entity under the communication act and other law our broadcast television business is also highly regulated by federal law and regulation our cable network filmed entertainment and theme park business are also subject to various other law and regulation at the international federal state and local level including law and regulation relating to environmental protection which have become more stringent over time and the safety of consumer product and theme park operation in addition we are subject to the nbcuniversal order and the nbcuniversal consent decree which have imposed numerous condition on our business relating to the treatment of competitor and other matter failure to comply with the law and regulation applicable to our business could result in administrative enforcement action fine and civil and criminal liability for more extensive discussion of the significant risk associated with the regulation of our business see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation discussion within that section change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on our business legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one which may significantly affect our business in addition the fcc and certain state are becoming more active in considering rulemakings and legislation well in conducting inquiry and review regarding our service any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business some of which may be significant for example more fully discussed in item business legislation and regulation in the fcc adopted new open internet regulation that reclassify broadband internet access service telecommunication service making it subject to certain common carriage regulation under title ii of the communication act this change could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation in addition in the fcc adopted an order that preempted certain state law that had restricted municipality from operating municipally owned broadband network the fcc is also considering the appropriate regulatory framework for voip service including whether that service should be regulated under title ii accordingly the legal and regulatory environment applicable to our business continues to intensify any change to the legal and regulatory framework applicable to any of our service or business could have negative impact on our business and result of operation comcast annual report on form table of content programming expense for our video service are increasing which could adversely affect our cable communication segment video business we expect programming expense for our video service to continue to be our cable communication segment largest single expense item and to increase in the foreseeable future the multichannel video provider industry ha experienced continued increase in the cost of programming especially sport programming which we expect will continue for the foreseeable future our programming expense may also increase we add programming to our video service or distribute existing programming to more of our customer or through additional delivery platform such on demand or streaming service additionally in the past few year we have begun paying certain local broadcast television station in exchange for their required consent for the retransmission of broadcast network programming to our video service customer we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demand for payment and other concession from local broadcast television station these market factor may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the medium industry which may further increase our programming expense if we are unable to raise our customer rate or offset programming cost increase through the sale of additional service the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our cable communication segment result of operation moreover our contract with content provider expire there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable term or that they will be renewed at all in which case we may be unable to provide such content part of our video service and our business and result of operation could be adversely affected nbcuniversal success depends on consumer acceptance of it content and it business may be adversely affected if it content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the cost to create or acquire content increase most of nbcuniversal business create and acquire medium and entertainment content the success of which depends substantially on consumer taste and preference that change in often unpredictable way the

other content that meet the changing preference of the broad domestic and international consumer market we have invested and will continue to invest substantial amount in our content including in the production of original content on our cable network and broadcast television network in our film and for theme park attraction before learning the extent to which it would earn consumer acceptance we also obtain significant portion of our content from third party such movie studio television production company sport organization and other supplier competition for popular content particularly for sport programming is intense and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitor for popular content entering into or renewing contract for such programming right or acquiring additional right may result in significantly increased cost particularly with respect to long term contract for sport programming right our result of operation and cash flow over the term of contract depend on number of factor including the strength of the advertising market our audience size and the ability to secure distribution from and impose surcharge or obtain carriage on multichannel video provider for the content and the timing and amount of our right payment there can be no assurance that revenue from these contract will exceed our cost for the right well the other cost of producing and distributing the programming if our content doe not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or if we can not obtain or retain right to popular content on acceptable term or at all our business may be adversely affected the loss of nbcuniversal programming distribution agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could adversely affect it business our cable network depend on their ability to secure and maintain distribution agreement with multichannel video provider our broadcast television network depend on their ability to secure and maintain

our nbc and telemundo owned local broadcast television station have elected retransmission consent through december increasingly our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business have entered into agreement to license their prior season and library content on other distribution platform including subscription video on demand service and some multichannel video provider are offering smaller package of channel part of their streaming and linear television programming package in addition certain online entity may stream our broadcast television content online without our consent and without paying any compensation to result there can be no assurance that any of our distribution agreement will be renewed in the future on acceptable term or at all the loss of any of these agreement or the renewal of these agreement on le favorable term could reduce our distribution revenue and the reach of our television programming and it attractiveness to advertiser

ability to generate revenue from the legitimate sale of our content well from the sale of advertising in connection with our content and increase our cost due to our active enforcement of our intellectual property right for example nbcuniversal ha brought suit against multichannel video provider to challenge the commercial skipping functionality in it dvr additionally legislation ha been proposed in the congress that seems intended to legitimize the unauthorized online streaming of local broadcast content we can not predict whether such legislation will be enacted or how any such legislation would ultimately affect our business piracy and other unauthorized us of content are made easier and the enforcement of intellectual property right more challenging by technological advance allowing the conversion of programming film and other content into digital format which facilitates the creation transmission and sharing of high quality unauthorized copy in particular piracy of programming and film through unauthorized distribution on dvd peer to peer computer network and other platform continues to present challenge for our cable network broadcast television and filmed entertainment business while piracy is challenge in the united state it is particularly prevalent in many part of the world that lack developed copyright law effective enforcement of copyright law and technical protective measure like those in effect in the united state if any or international law intended to combat piracy and protect intellectual property right are repealed or weakened or are not adequately enforced or if the legal system fails to adapt to new technology that facilitate piracy we may be unable to effectively protect our right and the value of our intellectual property may be negatively impacted and our cost of enforcing our right may increase see item business and refer to the legislation and regulation other area of regulation intellectual property discussion for additional information acquisition and other strategic initiative present many risk and we may not realize the financial and strategic goal that we had contemplated from time to time we make

recent accounting pronouncement see note to each of comcast and nbcuniversal consolidated financial statement for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncement critical accounting judgment and estimate the preparation of our consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the related disclosure of contingent asset and contingent liability we base our judgment on our historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance the result of which form the basis for making estimate about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition we believe our judgment and related estimate associated with the valuation and impairment testing of our cable franchise right and the accounting for film and television cost are critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgment and estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and the audit committee ha reviewed our disclosure relating to them which are presented below see note and to comcast consolidated financial statement for discussion of our accounting policy with respect to these item valuation and impairment testing of cable franchise right our largest asset our cable franchise right result from agreement we have with state and local government that allow to construct and operate cable business within specified geographic area the value of franchise is derived from the economic benefit we receive from the right to solicit new customer and to market new service such advanced video service and high speed internet and voice service in particular service area the amount we record for cable franchise right are primarily result of cable system acquisition typically when we acquire cable system the most significant asset we record is the value of the cable franchise right often these cable system acquisition include multiple franchise area we currently serve approximately franchise area in the united state we have concluded that our cable franchise right have an indefinite useful life since there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to our cash flow accordingly we do not amortize our cable franchise right but ass the carrying value of our cable franchise right annually or more frequently whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may exceed the fair value impairment testing comcast annual report on form table of content for the purpose of our impairment testing we have grouped the recorded value of our various cable franchise right into our three cable communication division or unit of account we evaluate the unit of account periodically to ensure our impairment testing is performed at an appropriate level the annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangible allows for the option to first ass qualitative factor to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible is le than it carrying amount an entity may choose to perform the qualitative assessment or an entity may bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test if it is determined on the basis of qualitative factor that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible is more likely than not le than it carrying value the quantitative impairment test is required when performing quantitative assessment we estimate the fair value of our cable franchise right primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis that involves significant judgment when analyzing the fair value indicated under the discounted cash flow model we also consider multiple of operating income before depreciation and amortization generated by the underlying asset current market transaction and profitability information in we performed qualitative assessment of our cable franchise right we considered various factor that would affect the estimated fair value of our cable franchise right including change in our projected future cash flow associated with our cable communication segment market transaction and macroeconomic condition and also the increase in our market capitalization since we performed our quantitative assessment in addition we considered the result of our quantitative assessment in which the estimated fair value of our franchise right exceeded the carrying value in our three cable communication division by and respectively we also compared our weighted average cost of capital in to that used in our quantitative assessment and it had remained relatively consistent based on our qualitative assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our franchise right were higher than our carrying value and that the performance of quantitative impairment test wa not required since the adoption of the accounting guidance related to goodwill and intangible asset in we have not recorded any significant impairment charge to cable franchise right result of our impairment testing future change in the unit of account could result in the recognition of an impairment charge we could also record impairment charge in the future if there are change in long term market condition in expected future operating result or in federal or state regulation that prevent from recovering the carrying value of these cable franchise right assumption made about increased competition and economic condition could also impact the result of any qualitative assessment and the valuation used in future annual quantitative impairment testing and result in reduction in the fair value of our cable franchise right film and television cost we capitalize film and television production cost including direct cost production overhead print cost development cost and interest we amortize capitalized film and television production cost including acquired library and accrue cost associated with participation and residual payment to programming and production expense we generally record the amortization and the accrued cost using the individual film forecast computation method which amortizes such cost using the ratio of the current period revenue to estimated total remaining gross revenue from all source ultimate revenue estimate of ultimate revenue have significant impact on how quickly capitalized cost are amortized and therefore are updated regularly our estimate of ultimate revenue for film generally include revenue from all source that are expected to be earned within year from the date of film initial release these estimate are based on the historical performance of similar content well factor unique to the content itself the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue for film intended for theatrical release is the film theatrical comcast annual report on form table of content performance subsequent revenue from the licensing and sale of film ha historically exhibited high correlation to it theatrical performance upon film release our estimate of revenue from succeeding market including home entertainment and other distribution platform are revised based on historical relationship and an analysis of current market trend with respect to television series or other owned television programming the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenue is whether the series can be successfully licensed beyond it initial license initial estimate of ultimate revenue are limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode under the initial license it is determined that television series or other owned television programming can be licensed for subsequent platform revenue estimate for these platform such and international syndication home entertainment and other distribution platform are included in ultimate revenue revenue estimate for produced episode include revenue expected to be earned within year of delivery of the initial episode or if still in production year from the delivery of the most recent episode if later we capitalize the cost of programming content that we license but do not own including right to multiyear live event sport programming at the earlier of when payment are made for the programming or when the license period begin and the content is available for use we amortize capitalized programming cost the associated program are broadcast we amortize multiyear live event sport programming right using the ratio of the current period revenue to the estimated ultimate revenue or under the term of the contract capitalized film and television cost well stage play production cost are subject to impairment testing when certain triggering event are identified if the fair value of production were to fall below it unamortized cost we would record an adjustment for the amount by which the unamortized capitalized cost exceed the production fair value the fair value assessment is generally based on estimated future discounted cash flow which are supported by our internal forecast adjustment to capitalized film and stage play production cost of million million and million were
