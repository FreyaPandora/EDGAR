service requirement we depend on external financing principally debt financing to fund the growth of our business and to ensure that we can meet ongoing maturity of our outstanding debt our access to

believe rate and term are appropriate our effort to manage these exposure may not be successful our use of interest rate hedging arrangement to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose to additional risk including risk that counterparty to hedging arrangement may fail to honor it obligation developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can

international operation may be impacted by any unhedged movement in the foreign currency in which those operation transact and in which our net investment in the foreign operation is held we may pursue additional expansion and development opportunity outside the united state international development and ownership activity carry risk that are different from those we face with our domestic

underground storage tank used to store waste oil or other petroleum product many of our property contain or at one time contained asbestos containing material or underground storage tank primarily related to auto service center establishment or emergency electrical generation equipment the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substance may be substantial and could adversely affect our result of operation or financial condition but is not estimable the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination may also adversely affect our ability to sell lease or redevelop property or to borrow using property collateral our effort to identify environmental liability may not be successful although we believe that our portfolio is in substantial compliance with federal state and local environmental law ordinance and regulation regarding hazardous or toxic substance this belief is based on limited testing nearly all of our property have been subjected to phase or similar environmental audit these environmental audit have not revealed are we aware of any environmental liability that we believe will have material adverse effect on our result of operation or financial condition however we can not assure you that existing environmental study with respect to the portfolio reveal all potential environmental liability any previous owner occupant or tenant of property not create any material environmental condition not known to the current environmental condition of the portfolio will not be affected by tenant and occupant by the

activity the economy and consumer spending appear to be recovering from the effect of the recent recession we derive our cash flow from operation primarily from retail tenant many of have been and continue to be under degree of economic stress significant deterioration in our cash flow from operation could require to curtail planned capital expenditure or seek alternative source of financing we may not be able to lease newly developed property and renew lease and relet space at existing property we may not be able to lease new property to an appropriate mix of tenant or for rent that are consistent with our projection also when lease for our existing property expire the premise may not be relet or the term of reletting including the cost of allowance and concession to tenant may be le favorable than the current lease term to the extent that our leasing plan are not achieved our cash generated debt repayment and capital expenditure could be adversely affected change in economic and operating condition that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other asset could impact the assumption used in that assessment and could result in future charge to earnings if assumption regarding those investment differ from actual result some of our property depend on anchor store or major tenant to attract shopper and could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more of these anchor store or major tenant our property are typically anchored by department store and other large nationally recognized tenant the value of some of our property could

store often referred to big box store corporate merger activity typically result in the closure of duplicate or geographically overlapping store location further sustained table of content adverse pressure on the result of our department store and major tenant may have similarly sustained adverse impact upon our own result certain department store and other national retailer have experienced and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future given current macroeconomic uncertainty and le than desirable level of consumer confidence considerable decrease in customer traffic in their retail store increased competition from alternative retail option such those accessible via the internet and other form of pressure on their business model pressure on these department store and national retailer increase their ability to maintain their store meet their obligation both to and to their external lender and supplier withstand takeover attempt by investor or rival or avoid bankruptcy and or liquidation may be impaired and result in closure of their store other tenant may be entitled to modify the economic or other term of their existing lease in the event of such closure the modification could be unfavorable to the lessor and could decrease rent or expense recovery charge additionally department store or major tenant closure may result in decreased customer traffic which could lead to decreased sale at our property if the sale of store operating in our property were to decline significantly due to the closing of anchor store or other national retailer adverse economic condition or other reason tenant may be unable to pay their minimum rent or expense recovery charge in the event of any default by tenant we may not be able to fully recover and or may experience delay and cost in enforcing our right landlord to recover amount due to under the term of our agreement with such party we face potential adverse effect from tenant bankruptcy bankruptcy filing by retailer can occur regularly in the course of our operation we continually seek to lease vacant space resulting from tenant termination the bankruptcy of tenant particularly an anchor tenant may make it more difficult to lease the remainder of the affected property future tenant bankruptcy could adversely affect our property or impact our ability to successfully execute our re leasing strategy we face wide range of competition that could affect our ability to operate profitably our property compete with other retail property and other form of retailing such catalog and commerce website competition may come from mall outlet center community lifestyle center and other shopping center both existing well future development project well catalog and commerce the presence of competitive alternative affect our ability to lease space and the level of rent we can obtain new construction renovation and expansion at competing site could also negatively affect our property
