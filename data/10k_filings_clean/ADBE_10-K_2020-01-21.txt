we discus some of the factor that could cause these difference these and many other factor described in this report could adversely affect our operation performance and financial condition our competitive position and result of operation could be harmed if we do not compete effectively the market for our product and service are characterized by intense competition new industry standard evolving distribution model limited barrier to entry disruptive technology development short product life cycle customer price sensitivity and frequent product introduction including alternative with limited functionality available at lower cost or free of charge any of these factor could create downward pressure on pricing and gross margin and could adversely affect our renewal and upsell and cross sell rate well our ability to attract new customer our future success will depend on our continued ability to enhance and integrate our existing product and service introduce new product and service in timely and cost effective manner meet changing customer expectation and need extend our core technology into new application and anticipate emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development furthermore some of our competitor and potential competitor enjoy competitive advantage such greater financial technical sale marketing and other resource broader brand awareness and access to larger customer base result of these advantage potential and current customer might select the product and service of our competitor causing loss of our market share in addition consolidation ha occurred among some of our competitor further consolidation in these market may subject to increased competitive pressure and may harm our result of operation for additional information regarding our competition and the risk arising out of the competitive environment in which we operate see the section entitled competition contained in part item of this report if we can not continue to develop acquire market and offer new product and service or enhancement to existing product and service that meet customer requirement our operating result could suffer the process of developing and acquiring new technology product and service and enhancing existing offering is complex costly and uncertain if we fail to anticipate customer rapidly changing need and expectation or adapt to emerging technological trend our market share and result of operation could suffer we must make long term investment develop acquire or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resource before knowing whether our prediction will accurately reflect customer demand for our product and service if we misjudge customer need in the future our new product and service may not succeed and our revenue and earnings may be harmed additionally any delay in the development acquisition marketing or launch of new offering or enhancement to an existing offering could result in customer attrition or impede our ability to attract new customer causing decline in our revenue earnings or stock price and weakening our competitive position we offer our product on variety of hardware platform consumer continue to migrate from personal computer to tablet and mobile device if we can not continue adapting our product to tablet and mobile device or if our competitor can adapt their product more quickly than our business could be harmed release of new device or operating system may make it more difficult for our product to perform or may require significant cost in order for to adapt our solution to such device or operating system these potential cost and delay could harm our business introduction of new technology could harm our business and result of operation the expectation and need of technology consumer are constantly evolving our future success depends on variety of factor including our continued ability to innovate introduce new product and service efficiently enhance and integrate our product and service in timely and cost effective manner extend our core technology into new application and anticipate emerging standard business model software delivery method and other technological development integration of our product and service with one another and other company offering creates an increasingly complex ecosystem that is partly reliant on third party if any disruptive technology or competing product service or operating system that are not compatible with our solution achieve widespread acceptance our operating result could suffer and our business could be harmed the introduction of certain technology may reduce the effectiveness of our product for example some of our product rely on third party cooky which are placed on individual browser when consumer visit website that contain advertisement we use these cooky to help our customer more effectively advertise gauge the performance of their advertisement and detect and prevent fraudulent activity consumer can block or delete cooky through their browser or ad blocking software or application the most common internet browser allow consumer to modify their browser setting to prevent cooky from being accepted by their browser or are set to block third party cooky by default increased use of method software or application that block cooky could harm our business of contentssecurity breach in data center we manage or third party manage on our behalf may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of employee and customer data which could expose to liability and adversely affect our reputation and business we process and store significant amount of employee and customer data large volume of which is hosted by third party service provider security incident impacting our own data center or those controlled by our service provider may compromise the confidentiality integrity or availability of this data unauthorized access to or loss or disclosure of data stored by adobe or our service provider may occur through physical break in breach of secure network by an unauthorized party software vulnerability or coding error employee theft or misuse or other misconduct it is also possible that unauthorized access to or disclosure of employee or customer data may be obtained through inadequate use of security control by customer or employee account created with weak or recycled password could allow cyber attacker to gain access to employee or customer data additionally failure by adobe or our customer to remove the account of their own employee or the granting of account in an uncontrolled manner may allow for access by former or unauthorized individual if there were an inadvertent disclosure of customer data or unauthorized access to the data we posse on behalf of our customer our operation could be disrupted our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to claim or other liability regulatory investigation or fine in addition such perceived or actual unauthorized loss or disclosure of the information we collect process or store or breach of our security could damage our reputation result in the loss of customer and harm our business we rely on data center managed both by adobe and third party to host and deliver our service well access collect process use transmit and store data and any interruption or delay in these hosted service or failure in data collection or transmission could expose to liability and harm our business and reputation much of our business relies on hardware and service that are hosted managed and controlled directly by adobe or third party service provider including our online store at adobe com creative cloud document cloud and experience cloud solution we do not have redundancy for all of our system many of our critical application reside in only one of our data center and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventuality if our business relationship with third party provider of hosting or content delivery service is negatively affected or if one of our content delivery supplier were to terminate it agreement with without adequate notice we might not be able to deliver the corresponding hosted offering to our customer which could subject to reputational harm costly and time intensive notification requirement and cause to lose customer and future business occasionally we migrate data among data center and to third party hosted environment if transition among data center or to third party service provider encounter unexpected interruption unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruption despite precaution undertaken during the process this may impair our delivery of product and service to customer and result in increased cost and liability which may harm our operating result and our business it is also possible that hardware or software failure or error in our system or those of our third party service provider could result in data loss or corruption cause the information that we collect or maintain to be incomplete or contain inaccuracy that our customer regard significant or cause to fail to meet committed service level or comply with regulatory notification requirement furthermore our ability to collect and report data may be delayed or interrupted by number of factor including access to the internet the failure of our network or software system security breach or significant variability in visitor traffic on customer website in addition computer virus worm or other malware may harm our system causing to lose data and the transmission of computer virus or other malware could expose to litigation or regulatory investigation and costly and time intensive notification requirement we may also find on occasion that we can not deliver data and report to our customer in near real time of number of factor including significant spike in customer activity on their website or failure of our network or software or the failure of our third party service provider network or software if we fail to plan infrastructure capacity appropriately and expand it proportionally with the need of our customer base and we experience rapid and significant demand on the capacity of our data center or those of third party service outage could occur and our customer could suffer impaired performance of our service such strain on our infrastructure capacity could subject to regulatory and customer notification requirement violation of service level agreement commitment financial liability result in customer dissatisfaction or harm our business if we supply inaccurate information or experience interruption in our ability to capture store and supply information in near real time or at all our reputation could be harmed and we could lose customer result or we could be found liable for damage or incur other loss increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issue and expanding law could impact our business model and expose to increased liability global company adobe is subject to global data privacy and security law regulation and code of conduct that apply to our various business unit these law and regulation may be inconsistent across jurisdiction and are subject to evolving and differing sometimes conflicting interpretation government official and regulator privacy advocate and class action attorney of contentsare increasingly scrutinizing how company collect process use store share and transmit personal data this increased scrutiny may result in new interpretation of existing law thereby further impacting adobe business globally new and emerging law such the general data protection regulation gdpr and the network and information system directive nisd in europe state law in the on privacy data and related technology such the california consumer privacy act well industry self regulatory code create new compliance obligation and expand the scope of potential liability either jointly or severally with our customer and supplier while we have invested in readiness to comply with applicable requirement these new and emerging law regulation and code may affect our ability and our enterprise customer ability to reach current and prospective customer to respond to both enterprise and individual customer request under the law such individual right of access correction and deletion of their personal information and to implement our business model effectively these new law may also impact our innovation and business driver in developing new and emerging technology artificial intelligence and machine learning these requirement among others may impact demand for our offering and force to bear the burden of more onerous obligation in our contract any perception of our practice product or service violation of individual privacy right may subject to public criticism class action lawsuit reputational harm or investigation or claim by regulator industry group or other third party all of which could disrupt our business and expose to increased liability additionally we collect and store information on behalf of our business customer and if our customer fail to comply with contractual obligation or applicable law it could result in litigation or reputational harm to transferring personal information across international border is becoming increasingly complex for example european data transfer outside the european economic area are highly regulated the mechanism that we and many other company rely upon for european data transfer privacy shield and model clause are being contested in the european court system we are closely monitoring development related to requirement for transferring personal data outside the european union and other country that have similar trans border data flow requirement these requirement may result in an increase in the obligation required to provide our service in the european union or in sanction and fine for non compliance several other country including australia and japan have also established specific legal requirement for cross border transfer of personal information other country such india are considering requirement for data localization where personal data must remain in the country if the mechanism for transferring personal information from certain country or area including europe to the united state should be found invalid or if other country implement more restrictive regulation for cross border data transfer or not permit data to leave the country of origin such development could harm our business financial condition and result of operation security vulnerability in our product and system or in our supply chain could lead to reduced revenue or to liability claim maintaining the security of our product and service is critical issue for and our customer security threat to our information system end point and network have the potential to impact our customer well security researcher criminal hacker and other third party regularly develop new technique to penetrate our end point information system and network security measure and we have previously disclosed certain unauthorized party have in the past managed to gain access to and misuse some of our system and software in order to access our end user authentication payment and personal information in addition cyber attacker also develop and deploy virus worm credential stuffing attack tool and other malicious software program some of which may be specifically designed to attack our product service information system or network hardware software and operating system application that we develop or procure from third party may contain defect in design or manufacture including bug vulnerability and other problem that could unexpectedly compromise the security of the system or impair customer ability to operate or use our product the cost to prevent eliminate mitigate or alleviate cyber or other security problem bug virus worm malicious software program and security vulnerability are significant and our effort to address these problem including notifying affected party may not be successful or may be delayed and could result in interruption delay cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customer it is impossible to predict the extent frequency or impact these problem may have on outside party have in the past and may in the future attempt to fraudulently induce our employee or user of our product or service to disclose sensitive personal or confidential information via illegal electronic spamming phishing or other tactic unauthorized party may also attempt to gain physical access to our facility in order to infiltrate our information system or attempt to gain logical access to our product service or information system for the purpose of exfiltrating content and data these actual and potential breach of our security measure and the accidental loss inadvertent disclosure or unauthorized dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive personal or confidential data about our employee our customer or their end user including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data result of hacking fraud trickery or other form of deception could expose our employee our customer or the individual affected to risk of loss or misuse of this information this may result in litigation and liability or fine our compliance with costly and time intensive notice requirement governmental inquiry or oversight or loss of customer confidence any of which could harm our business or damage our brand and reputation possibly impeding our present and future success in retaining and attracting new customer and thereby requiring time and resource to repair our brand and reputation these risk will likely increase we expand our hosted offering integrate our product and service and store and process more data including personal information of contentsthese problem affect our product and service in particular because cyber attacker tend to focus their effort on popular offering with large user base and we expect them to continue to do so critical vulnerability may be identified in some of our application and service and those of our third party service provider these vulnerability could cause such application and service to crash and could allow an attacker to access our or our user confidential or personal information or take control of the affected system which could result in liability to or limit our ability to conduct our business and deliver our product and service to customer we devote significant resource to address security vulnerability through engineering more secure product enhancing security and reliability feature in our product and system code hardening conducting rigorous penetration test deploying update to address security vulnerability reviewing our service provider security control reviewing and auditing our hosted service against independent security control framework such iso soc and pci and improving our incident response time but these security vulnerability can not be totally eliminated the cost of these step could reduce our operating margin and we may be unable to implement these measure quickly enough to prevent cyber attacker from gaining unauthorized access into our system and product despite our preventative effort actual or perceived security vulnerability in our product and system may harm our reputation or lead to claim against and have in the past led to such claim and could lead some customer to stop using certain product or service to reduce or delay future purchase of product or service or to use competing product or service if we do not make the appropriate level of investment in our technology system or if our system become out of date or obsolete and we are not able to deliver the quality of data security customer require our business could be adversely affected customer may also adopt security measure designed to protect their existing computer system from attack which could delay adoption of new technology further if we our supply chain or our customer are subject to future attack or our technology is used in third party attack we could be subject to costly and time intensive notice requirement and it may be necessary for to take additional extraordinary measure and make additional expenditure to take appropriate responsive and preventative step any of these event could adversely affect our revenue or margin moreover delayed sale lower margin or lost customer resulting from disruption caused by cyber attack or preventative measure could adversely affect our financial result stock price and reputation some of our enterprise offering have extended and complex sale cycle which can make our sale cycle unpredictable sale cycle for some of our enterprise offering including our adobe experience cloud and adobe experience platform solution and enterprise term license agreement etlas in our digital medium business are multi phased and complex the complexity in these sale cycle is due to several factor including the need for our sale representative to educate customer about the use and benefit of large scale deployment of our product and service including technical capability security feature potential cost saving and return on investment the desire of organization to undertake significant evaluation process to determine their technology requirement prior to making information technology expenditure the need for our representative to spend significant amount of time assisting potential customer in their testing and evaluation of our product and service intensifying competition within the industry the negotiation of large complex enterprise wide contract the need for our customer to obtain requisition approval from various decision maker within their organization due to the complexity of our solution touching multiple department within customer organization and customer budget constraint economic condition and unplanned administrative delay we spend substantial time and expense on our sale effort without assurance that potential customer will ultimately purchase our solution we target our sale effort at larger enterprise customer these trend are expected to continue and could have greater impact on our result of operation additionally our enterprise sale pattern ha historically been uneven where higher percentage of quarter total sale occur during the final week of each quarter which is common in our industry our extended sale cycle for these product and service make it difficult to predict when given sale cycle will close if our customer fail to renew subscription in accordance with our expectation our future revenue and operating result could suffer our adobe experience cloud creative cloud and document cloud offering typically involve subscription based offering pursuant to product and service agreement revenue from our subscription customer is generally recognized ratably over the term of their agreement which typically range from to month our customer have no obligation to renew their subscription for our service after the expiration of their initial subscription period and customer may not renew their subscription at the same or higher level of service for the same number of seat or for the same duration of time if at all moreover under certain of contentscircumstances some of our customer have the right to cancel their agreement prior to the expiration of the term our varied customer base combined with the flexibility we offer in the length of

company for billion and magento privately held commerce platform company for billion and integrated them into our digital experience reportable segment during fiscal we completed our acquisition of tubemogul publicly held video advertising platform company for million and integrated it into our digital experience reportable segment we also completed other immaterial business acquisition during the fiscal year presented see note of our note to consolidated financial statement for further information regarding these acquisition including pro forma financial information related to the marketo acquisition pro forma information ha not been presented for our other acquisition during the fiscal year presented the impact to our consolidated financial statement wa not material critical accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap and pursuant to the rule and regulation of the sec we make assumption judgment and estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our assumption judgment and estimate on historical experience and various other factor that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ materially from these estimate under different assumption or condition on regular basis we evaluate our assumption judgment and estimate we also discus our critical accounting policy and estimate with the audit committee of the board of director we believe that the assumption judgment and estimate involved in the accounting for revenue recognition business combination and income tax have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement these area are key component of our result of operation and are based on complex rule requiring to make judgment and estimate and consequently we consider these to be our critical accounting policy historically our assumption judgment and estimate relative to our critical accounting policy have not differed materially from actual result revenue recognition our contract with customer may include multiple good and service for example some of our offering include both on premise and or on device software license and cloud service determining whether the software license and the cloud service are distinct from each other and therefore performance obligation to be accounted for separately or not distinct from each other and therefore part of single performance obligation may require significant judgment we have concluded that the on premise on device software license and cloud service provided in our creative cloud and document cloud subscription offering are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud service are provided in reaching this conclusion we considered the nature of our promise to creative cloud and document cloud customer which is to provide complete end to end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple device and team we fulfill this promise by providing access to solution that integrates cloud based and on premise on device feature that together through their integration provide functionality utility and workflow efficiency that could not be obtained from either the on premise on device software or cloud service on their own cloud based feature that are integral to our creative cloud and document cloud offering and that work together with the on premise on device software include but are not limited to creative cloud library which enable customer to access their work setting preference and other asset seamlessly across

photograph content awareness natural language processing optical character recognition and automated document tagging of contentsbusiness combinationswe allocate the purchase price of acquired company to tangible and intangible asset acquired and liability assumed based upon their estimated fair value at the acquisition date the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimate and assumption with respect to intangible asset and deferred revenue obligation although we believe the assumption and estimate we have made are reasonable they are based in part on historical experience market condition and information obtained from management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain example of critical estimate in valuing certain of the intangible asset we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from software license sale subscription support agreement consulting contract and acquired developed technology and patent historical and expected customer attrition rate and anticipated growth in revenue from acquired customer the acquired company trade name and trademark well assumption about the period of time the acquired trade name and trademark will continue to be used in the combined company product portfolio the expected use of the acquired asset and discount rate in connection with the purchase price allocation for our acquisition we estimate the fair value of the deferred revenue obligation assumed the estimated fair value of these obligation is determined utilizing cost build up approach the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the cost related to fulfilling the obligation plus normal profit margin unanticipated event and circumstance may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumption estimate or actual result accounting for income taxeswe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year in addition deferred tax asset and liability are recognized for the expected future tax consequence of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards management must make assumption judgment and estimate to determine our current provision for income tax and also our deferred tax asset and liability our assumption judgment and estimate relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax law our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcome of current and future audit conducted by foreign and domestic tax authority we have established reserve for income tax to address potential exposure involving tax position that could be challenged by tax authority in addition we are subject to the continual examination of our income tax return by the internal revenue service irs and other domestic and foreign tax authority we expect future examination to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practice well other matter we regularly ass the likelihood of outcome resulting from these examination to determine the adequacy of our provision for income tax and have reserved for potential adjustment that may result from such examination we believe such estimate to be reasonable however the final determination of any of these examination could significantly impact the amount provided for income tax in our consolidated financial statement

foreign operation this increase wa offset in part by the provisional accounting expense recorded in the prior year for the effect of the tax act adoption our effective tax rate decreased by approximately percentage point during fiscal compared to fiscal the lower effective tax rate wa primarily due to the effect of the tax act enacted on december which included the reduction in the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from to effective on january and related change to our corporate tax structure from which we serve our foreign customer that provided the ability to deduct more expense against our earnings in the beginning in our fiscal the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate is and certain international provision of the tax act such tax on global intangible low tax income base erosion and anti abuse tax and special tax deduction for foreign derived intangible income took effect the treasury department ha issued proposed regulation that could impact the

would decrease the respective effective tax rate the combined amount of accrued interest and penalty related to tax position taken on our tax return were approximately million and million for fiscal and respectively these amount were included in long term income tax payable in their respective year the timing of the resolution of income tax examination is highly uncertain are the amount and timing of tax payment that are part of any audit settlement process these event could cause large fluctuation in the balance sheet classification of our tax asset and liability we believe that within

on premise term based software license bundled with maintenance and support under the previous standard revenue attributable to these software license wa recognized ratably over the term of the

contingent revenue limitation the requirement to estimate variable consideration for certain arrangement increased allocation of revenue to and from professional service and other offering and change to our financial statement disclosure such new disclosure related to our remaining performance obligation however the timing and pattern of revenue recognition related to our professional service and cloud enabled offering including creative cloud and document cloud for enterprise individual and team remain substantially unchanged when creative cloud and document cloud are sold with cloud enabled service the on premise on device software license and cloud enabled service are so highly interrelated and interdependent that they are not each separately identifiable within the context of the

service saas allow customer to access hosted software during the contractual term without taking possession of the software cloud hosted subscription service may be sold on fee per subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage we recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted service that are priced based on committed number of transaction where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the service occur evenly over time beginning on the date the service associated with the committed transaction are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term over usage fee and fee based on the actual number of transaction are billed in accordance with contract term these fee are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement variable consideration fee based on number of transaction or impression per month where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance customer benefit and consumption are typically accounted for utilizing the invoiced practical expedient revenue for subscription sold fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service when cloud enabled service are highly integrated and interrelated with on premise software such in our cloud enabled creative

license fee basis and recognize the related revenue ratably over the support term the underlying service is stand ready performance obligation we exclude from the transaction price sale and other tax collected from customer on behalf of the relevant government authority most of our product are delivered electronically however in instance where shipping and handling cost are incurred we treat these amount cost to fulfill the contract and they are not considered performance obligation and the associated fee are not included in the transaction price judgmentsour contract with customer may include multiple good and service for example some of our offering include both on premise and or on device software license and cloud service determining whether the software license and the cloud service are distinct from each other and therefore performance obligation to be accounted for separately or not distinct from each other and therefore part of single performance obligation may require significant judgment we have concluded that the on premise on device software license and cloud service provided in our creative cloud and document cloud subscription offering are not distinct from each other such that revenue from each offering should be recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud service are provided in reaching this conclusion we considered the nature of our promise to creative cloud and document cloud customer which is to provide complete end to end creative design or document workflow solution that operates seamlessly across multiple device and

customer change in the composition or carrying amount of reporting segment net asset and change in our stock price if after assessing the totality of event or circumstance we determine of contentsadobe inc note to consolidated financial statement continued that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting segment are greater than the carrying amount then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not performed if the qualitative assessment indicates that the quantitative analysis should be performed we then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting segment to it carrying value including the associated goodwill to determine the fair value we use the equal weighting of the market approach based on comparable publicly traded company in similar line of business and the income approach based on estimated discounted future cash flow our cash flow assumption consider historical and forecasted revenue operating cost and other relevant factor we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal we determined after performing qualitative review of each reporting segment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of our reporting segment substantially exceeds the respective carrying amount accordingly there wa no indication of impairment and the quantitative goodwill impairment test wa not performed we did not identify any event or change in circumstance since the performance of our annual goodwill impairment test that would require to perform another goodwill impairment test during the fiscal year we amortize intangible asset with finite life over their estimated useful life and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists we continually monitor event and change in circumstance that could indicate carrying amount of our long lived asset including our intangible asset may not be recoverable when such event or change in circumstance occur we ass recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such asset will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flow if the future undiscounted cash flow are le than the carrying amount of these asset we recognize an impairment loss based on any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset we did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charge in fiscal or during fiscal our intangible asset were amortized over their estimated useful life ranging from to year amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefit of the intangible asset will be consumed or on straight line basis when the consumption pattern is not apparent the weighted average useful life of our intangible asset were follows weighted
