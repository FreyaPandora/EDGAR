other total the number of residential and general service customer within the electric utility and infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time economic condition within the service territory continue to improve sale growth ha been hampered by continued adoption of energy efficiency and self generation the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliance is expected to have negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time while residential sale increased in compared to the growth rate wa modest when compared to historical period seasonality and the impact of weatherrevenues and cost are influenced by seasonal weather pattern peak sale of electricity occur during the summer and winter month which result in higher revenue and cash flow during these period by contrast lower sale of electricity occur during the spring and fall allowing for scheduled plant maintenance residential and general service customer are more impacted by weather than industrial customer estimated weather impact are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather condition normal weather condition are defined the long term average of actual historical weather condition the estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variance from normal condition and customer historic usage pattern the methodology used to estimate the impact of weather not consider all variable that may impact customer response to weather condition such humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trend to shorter term period heating degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature fall below base temperature cooling degree day measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rise the base temperature each degree of temperature below the base temperature count one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature count one cooling degree day competitionretailelectric utility and infrastructure business operate the sole supplier of electricity within their service territory with the exception of ohio which ha competitive electricity supply market for generation service electric utility and infrastructure owns and operates facility necessary to transmit and distribute electricity and except in ohio to generate electricity service are priced by state commission approved rate designed to include the cost of providing these service and reasonable return on invested capital this regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair price competition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy source including on site generation from industrial customer and distributed generation such private solar at residential general service and or industrial customer site duke energy is not aware of any proposed legislation within any of it jurisdiction that would provide retail customer the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry including broadly subsidizing distributed generation such private solar although there is no pending legislation at this time if the retail jurisdiction served by electric utility and infrastructure become subject to deregulation the recovery of stranded cost could become significant consideration stranded cost primarily include the generation asset of electric utility and infrastructure whose value in competitive marketplace may be le than their current book value well above market purchased power commitment from qualifying facility qfs the public utility regulatory policy act of purpa established new class of generating facility qfs typically small power production facility that generate power within utility company service territory for which the utility company are legally obligated to purchase the energy at an avoided cost rate thus far all state that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover substantial portion of stranded cost ielectric utility and infrastructure largest stranded cost exposure is primarily related to duke energy florida purchased power commitment with qfs which it ha future minimum expected capacity payment through of billion duke energy florida wa obligated to enter into these contract under provision of purpa duke energy florida continues to seek way to address the impact of escalating payment under these contract however the fpsc allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from qfs for additional information related to these purchased power commitment see note to the consolidated financial statement commitment and contingency in ohio electric utility and infrastructure conduct competitive auction for electricity supply the cost of energy purchased through these auction is recovered from retail customer electric utility and infrastructure earns retail margin in ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity and not on the cost of the underlying energy wholesaleduke energy competes with other utility and merchant generator for bulk power sale sale to municipality and cooperative and wholesale transaction under primarily cost based contract approved by ferc the principal factor in competing for these sale are price availability of capacity and power and reliability of service price are influenced primarily by market condition and fuel cost increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect electric utility and infrastructure load forecast plan for power supply and wholesale energy sale and related revenue wholesale energy sale will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of electric utility and infrastructure to attract new customer and to retain existing customer energy capacity and resourceselectric utility and infrastructure owns approximately megawatt mw of generation capacity for additional information on owned generation facility see item property energy and capacity are also supplied through contract with other generator and purchased on the open market factor that could cause electric utility and infrastructure to purchase power for it customer may include but are not limited to generating plant outage extreme weather condition generation reliability demand growth and price electric utility and infrastructure ha interconnection and arrangement with it neighboring utility to facilitate planning emergency assistance sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply electric utility and infrastructure generation portfolio is balanced mix of energy resource different operating characteristic and fuel source designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet it obligation to serve retail customer all option including owned generation resource and purchased power opportunity are continually evaluated on real time basis to select and dispatch the lowest cost resource available to meet system load requirement potential plant retirementsthe subsidiary registrant periodically file integrated resource plan irp with state regulatory commission the irps provide view of forecasted energy need over long term to year and option considered to meet those need recent irps filed by the subsidiary registrant included planning assumption to potentially retire certain coal fired generating facility earlier than their current estimated useful life primarily these facility not have the requisite emission control equipment to meet united state environmental protection agency epa regulation recently approved or proposed duke energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal fired generating facility earlier than the current estimated useful life and plan to seek regulatory recovery for amount that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these asset are retired for additional information related to potential plant retirement see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter on october the epa published in the federal register the final clean power plan cpp rule that regulates carbon dioxide emission from existing fossil fuel fired electric generating unit egus the cpp establishes emission rate and mass cap goal that apply to existing fossil fuel fired egus petition challenging the rule filed by several group and on february the supreme court issued stay of the final cpp rule halting implementation of the cpp legal challenge are resolved state in which the duke energy registrant operate have suspended work on the cpp in response to the stay oral argument of the judge on circuit court were heard on september the court ha not issued it opinion in the case on march president trump signed an executive order directing epa to review the cpp and determine whether to suspend revise or rescind the rule on the day the department of justice doj filed motion with the circuit court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed by epa on april the court issued an order to suspend the litigation for day on august the court on it own motion extended the suspension of the litigation for an additional day on october epa issued notice of proposed rulemaking npr to repeal the cpp based on change to epa legal interpretation of the section of the clean air act caa on which the cpp wa based in the proposal epa indicates that it ha not determined whether it will issue rule to replace the cpp and if it will do when and what form that rule will take the comment period on epa npr end april on december epa issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking anprm in which it seek public comment on various aspect of potential cpp replacement rule the comment period on the anprm end february if epa decides to move forward with cpp replacement rule it will need to issue formal proposal for public comment litigation of the cpp remains on hold in the circuit and the february supreme court stay of the cpp remains in effect ishould the cpp be upheld compliance could cause the industry to replace coal fired generation with natural gas and renewables cost to operate coal fired generation plant continue to grow due to increasing environmental compliance requirement including ash management cost unrelated to cpp which may result in the retirement of coal fired generation plant earlier than the current end of useful life the duke energy registrant could incur increased fuel purchased power operation and maintenance and other cost for replacement generation result of this rule due to the uncertainty related to the implementation of the cpp the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of these matter source of electricityelectric utility and infrastructure relies principally on coal nuclear fuel and natural gas for it generation of electricity the following table list source of electricity and fuel cost for the three year ended december cost of delivered fuel per net

will fluctuate over time coal market change electric utility and infrastructure ha an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet it hedging guideline regarding projected future consumption result of volatility in natural gas price and the associated impact on coal fired dispatch within the generation fleet coal inventory will continue to fluctuate electric utility and infrastructure continues to actively manage it portfolio and ha worked with supplier to obtain increased flexibility in it coal contract coal purchased for the carolina is primarily produced from mine in central appalachia northern appalachia and the illinois basin coal purchased for florida is primarily produced from mine in colorado and the illinois basin coal purchased for kentucky is delivered by barge and is produced from mine along the ohio river in illinois ohio west virginia and pennsylvania coal purchased for indiana is primarily produced in indiana and illinois the current average sulfur content of coal purchased by electric utility and infrastructure is between percent and percent for duke energy carolina between percent and percent for duke energy progress between percent and percent for duke energy florida between percent and percent for duke energy ohio and between percent and percent for duke energy indiana electric utility and infrastructure environmental control in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide emission allowance enable electric utility and infrastructure to satisfy current emission limitation for it existing facility nuclearthe industrial process for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrate and service to convert enrich and fabricate fuel assembly electric utility and infrastructure ha contracted for uranium material and service to fuel it nuclear reactor uranium concentrate conversion service and enrichment service are primarily met through diversified portfolio of long term supply contract the contract are diversified by supplier country of origin and pricing electric utility and infrastructure stagger it contracting so that it portfolio of long term contract cover the majority of it fuel requirement in the near term and decreasing portion of it fuel requirement over time thereafter near term requirement not met by long term supply contract have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchase due to the technical complexity of changing supplier of fuel fabrication service electric utility and infrastructure generally source these service to single domestic supplier on plant by plant basis using multiyear contract electric utility and infrastructure ha entered into fuel contract that cover percent of it uranium concentrate conversion service and enrichment service requirement through at least and cover fabrication service requirement for these plant through at least for future requirement not already covered under long term contract electric utility and infrastructure belief it will be able to renew contract they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangement with other supplier of nuclear fuel

for electric power plant well nuclear energy significant competitive factor is price gas utility and infrastructure primary product competition is with electricity for heating water heating and cooking increase in the price of natural gas or decrease in the price of other energy source could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefit of natural gas to the consumer in the case of industrial customer such manufacturing plant adverse economic or market condition including higher natural gas cost could cause these customer to suspend business operation or to use alternative source of energy in favor of energy source with lower per unit cost higher natural gas cost or decrease in the price of other energy source may allow competition from alternative energy source for application that have traditionally used natural gas encouraging customer to move away from natural gas fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy source competition between natural gas and other form of energy is also based on efficiency performance reliability safety and other non price factor technological improvement in other energy source and event that impair the public perception of the non price attribute of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage these factor in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas impair our ability to attract new customer and cause existing customer to switch to other form of energy or to bypass our system in favor of alternative competitive source this could result in slow or no customer growth and could

note to the consolidated financial statement business segment iitem risk factor in addition to other disclosure within this form including management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation matter impacting future result for each registrant in item and other document filed with the sec from time to time the following factor should be considered in evaluating duke energy and it subsidiary such factor could affect actual result of operation and cause result to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought unless otherwise indicated risk factor discussed below generally relate to risk associated with all of the duke energy registrant risk identified at the subsidiary registrant level are generally applicable to duke energy business strategy risksduke energy future result could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement it business strategy duke energy future result of operation depend in significant part on the extent to which it can implement it business strategy successfully duke energy strategy including transforming the customer experience modernizing the energy grid generating cleaner energy expansion of natural gas infrastructure modernizing the regulatory construct and engaging employee and stakeholder to accomplish these priority is subject to business economic and competitive uncertainty and contingency many of which are beyond it control consequence duke energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated result of it strategy regulatory legislative and legal risksthe duke energy registrant regulated utility revenue earnings and result are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation electric and natural gas transmission distribution and related activity which may limit their ability to recover cost the duke energy registrant regulated electric and natural gas utility business are regulated on cost of service rate of return basis subject to statute and regulatory commission rule and procedure of north carolina south carolina florida ohio tennessee indiana and kentucky if the duke energy registrant regulated utility earnings exceed the return established by the state utility commission retail electric and natural gas rate may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commission which may decrease the duke energy registrant future earnings additionally if regulatory body do not allow recovery of cost incurred in providing service on timely basis the duke energy registrant future earnings could be negatively impacted if legislative and regulatory structure were to evolve in such way that the duke energy registrant exclusive right to serve their regulated customer were eroded their future earnings could be negatively impacted federal and state regulation law and other effort designed to promote and expand the use of energy efficiency measure and distributed generation technology such private solar and battery storage in duke energy service territory could result in customer leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering which allows customer with private solar to receive bill credit for surplus power at the full retail amount over time customer adoption of these technology and increased energy efficiency could result in excess generation resource well stranded cost if duke energy is not able to fully recover the cost and investment in generation state regulator have approved various mechanism to stabilize natural gas utility margin including margin decoupling in north carolina rate stabilization in south carolina and uncollectible natural gas cost recovery in all state state regulator have approved other margin stabilizing mechanism that for example allow for recovery of margin loss associated with negotiated transaction designed to retain large volume customer that could use alternative fuel or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline if regulator decided to discontinue the duke energy registrant use of tariff mechanism it would negatively impact result of operation financial condition and cash flow in addition regulatory authority also review whether natural gas cost are prudent and can disallow the recovery of portion of natural gas cost that the duke energy registrant seek to recover from customer which would adversely impact earnings the rate that the duke energy registrant regulated utility business are allowed to charge are established by state utility commission in rate case proceeding which may limit their ability to recover cost and earn an appropriate return on investment the rate that the duke energy registrant regulated utility business are allowed to charge significantly influence the result of operation financial position and liquidity of the duke energy registrant the regulation of the rate that the regulated utility business charge customer is determined in large part by state utility commission in rate case proceeding negative decision made by these regulator could have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position or liquidity and affect the ability of the duke energy registrant to recover cost and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investment being made duke energy can not predict the outcome of these rate case proceeding deregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered cost that could adversely affect the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow and their utility business increased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have significant adverse impact on the duke energy registrant result of operation financial position or cash flow retail competition and the unbundling of regulated electric service could have significant adverse financial impact on the duke energy registrant due to an impairment of asset loss of retail customer lower profit margin or increased cost of capital the duke energy registrant can not predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitor into the electric market the duke energy registrant can not predict if or when they will be subject to change in legislation or regulation nor can they predict the impact of these change on their financial position result of operation or cash flow ithe duke energy registrant business are subject to extensive federal regulation and wide variety of law and governmental policy including tax that may change over time in way that affect operation and cost duke energy is subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state regulation and policy there can be no assurance that law regulation and policy will not be changed in way that result in material modification of business model and objective or affect return on investment by restricting activity and product subjecting to escalating cost or prohibiting them outright on december president trump signed the tax cut and job act the tax act into law which among other provision reduces the maximum federal corporate income tax rate from percent to percent and limit interest deduction outside of regulated utility operation effective january the resulting revaluation of existing deferred tax asset and liability to the lower federal corporate tax rate were recognized in duke energy december financial statement guidance issued by the sec indicates that additional adjustment for item that were estimated may be recorded during if new information becomes available the tax act also could be amended or subject to technical correction which could change the financial impact that were recorded at december or are expected to be recorded in future period the ferc and state utility commission will determine the regulatory treatment of the impact of the tax act duke energy future result of operation financial condition and cash flow could be adversely impacted by the tax act subsequent amendment or correction or the action of the ferc state utility commission or credit rating agency related to the tax act the duke energy registrant are subject to regulation by ferc nrc epa and various other federal agency well the north american electric reliability corporation regulation affect almost every aspect of the duke energy registrant business including among other thing their ability to take fundamental business management action determine the term and rate of transmission and distribution service make acquisition issue equity or debt security engage in transaction with other subsidiary and affiliate and pay dividend upstream to the duke energy registrant change to federal regulation are continuous and ongoing the duke energy registrant can not predict the future course of regulatory change or the ultimate effect those change will have on their business however change in regulation can cause delay in or affect business planning and transaction and can substantially increase the duke energy registrant cost the duke energy registrant are subject to numerous environmental law and regulation requiring significant capital expenditure that can increase the cost of operation and which may impact or limit business plan or cause exposure to environmental liability the duke energy registrant are subject to numerous environmental law and regulation affecting many aspect of their present and future operation including ccrs air emission water quality wastewater discharge solid waste and hazardous waste these law and regulation can result in increased capital operating and other cost these law and regulation generally require the duke energy registrant to obtain and comply with wide variety of environmental license permit inspection and other approval compliance with environmental law and regulation can require significant expenditure including expenditure for cleanup cost and damage arising from contaminated property failure to comply with environmental regulation may result in the imposition of fine penalty and injunctive measure affecting operating asset the step the duke energy registrant could be required to take to ensure their facility are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive result the duke energy registrant may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facility which may cause the duke energy registrant to incur loss further the duke energy registrant may not be successful in recovering capital and operating cost incurred to comply with new environmental regulation through existing regulatory rate structure and their contract with customer also the duke energy registrant may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approval for their operating asset or development project delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval failure to obtain and comply with them or change in environmental law or regulation to more stringent compliance level could result in additional cost of operation for existing facility or development of new facility being prevented delayed or subject to additional cost although it is not expected that the cost to comply with current environmental regulation will have material adverse effect on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow due to regulatory cost recovery the duke energy registrant are at risk that the cost of complying with environmental regulation in the future will have such an effect the epa ha recently enacted or proposed new federal regulation governing the management of cooling water intake structure wastewater and emission these regulation may require the duke energy registrant to make additional capital expenditure and increase operating and maintenance cost the duke energy registrant operation capital expenditure and financial result may be affected by regulatory change related to the impact of global climate change there is continued concern both nationally and internationally about climate change the epa may adopt and implement regulation to restrict emission of ghgs increased regulation of ghg emission could impose significant additional cost on the duke energy registrant operation their supplier and customer regulatory change could also result in generation facility to be retired early and result in stranded cost if duke energy is not able to fully recover the cost and investment in generation at this time the effect that climate change regulation may have in the future on duke energy business financial condition or result of operation is not able to be predicted ioperational risksthe duke energy registrant result of operation may be negatively affected by overall market economic and other condition that are beyond their control sustained downturn or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the market in which the duke energy registrant operate and negatively influence operation decline in demand for electricity or natural gas result of economic downturn in the duke energy registrant regulated service territory will reduce overall sale and lessen cash flow especially industrial customer reduce production and therefore consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas although the duke energy registrant regulated electric and natural gas business are subject to regulated allowable rate of return and recovery of certain cost such fuel and purchased natural gas cost under periodic adjustment clause overall decline in electricity or natural gas sold result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenue and cash flow thereby diminishing result of operation additionally prolonged economic downturn that negatively impact the duke energy registrant result of operation and cash flow could result in future material impairment charge to write down the carrying value of certain asset including goodwill to their respective fair value the duke energy registrant also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power market on contractual basis with respect to such transaction the duke energy registrant are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investment through mandated rate and revenue and result of operation are likely to depend in large part upon prevailing market price these market price may fluctuate substantially over relatively short period of time and could reduce the duke energy registrant revenue and margin thereby diminishing result of operation factor that could impact sale volume generation of electricity and market price at which the duke energy registrant are able to sell electricity and natural gas are follows weather condition including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purpose applicable and period of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facility in an economical manner supply of and demand for energy commodity transmission or transportation constraint or inefficiency that impact nonregulated energy operation availability of competitively priced alternative energy source which are preferred by some customer over electricity produced from coal nuclear or natural gas plant and customer usage of energy efficient equipment that reduces energy demand natural gas crude oil and refined product production level and price ability to procure satisfactory level of inventory such coal natural gas and uranium and capacity and transmission service into or of the duke energy registrant market natural disaster or operational accident may adversely affect the duke energy registrant operating result natural disaster such electromagnetic event or the earthquake and tsunami in japan or other operational accident within the company or industry such the san bruno california natural gas transmission pipeline failure could have direct significant impact on the duke energy registrant well on key contractor and supplier such event could indirectly impact the duke energy registrant through change to policy law and regulation whose compliance cost have significant impact on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant could be negatively impacted due to their obligation to comply with federal and state regulation law and other legal requirement that govern the operation assessment storage closure remediation disposal and monitoring relating to ccr the high cost and new rate impact associated with implementing these new ccr related requirement and the strategy and method necessary to implement these requirement in compliance with these legal obligation result of electricity produced for decade at coal fired power plant the duke energy registrant manage large amount of ccr that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfill or combined with water in other surface impoundment all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirement however the potential exists for another ccr related incident such the one that occurred during the dan river steam station ash basin release that could raise environmental or general public health concern such ccr related incident could have material adverse impact on the reputation and financial condition of the duke energy registrant during epa regulation were enacted related to the management of ccr from power plant these regulation classify ccr nonhazardous waste under the rcra and apply to electric generating site with new and existing landfill new and existing surface impoundment structural fill and ccr pile and establishes requirement regarding landfill design structural integrity design and assessment criterion for surface impoundment groundwater monitoring protection and remedial procedure and other operational and reporting procedure for the disposal and management of ccr in addition to the federal regulation ccr landfill and surface impoundment will continue to be independently regulated by existing state law regulation and permit well additional legal requirement that may be imposed in the future these federal and state law regulation and other legal requirement may require or result in additional expenditure increased operating and maintenance cost and or result in closure of certain power generating facility which could affect the financial position result of operation and cash flow of the duke energy registrant the duke energy registrant intend to seek full cost recovery for expenditure through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commission who permit recovery in rate of necessary and prudently incurred cost associated with the duke energy registrant regulated operation and through other wholesale contract with term that contemplate recovery of such cost although there is no guarantee of full cost recovery in addition the timing for recovery of such cost could have material adverse impact on duke energy cash flow ithe duke energy registrant have recognized significant asset retirement obligation related to these ccr related requirement closure activity began in at the four site specified high priority by the coal ash act and at the lee steam station site in south carolina in connection with other legal requirement excavation at these site involves movement of large amount of ccr material to off site location for use structural fill to appropriate engineered off site or on site lined landfill or conversion of the ash for beneficial use at other site preliminary planning and closure method have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management cost the coal ash act requires ccr surface impoundment in north carolina to be closed with the closure method and timing based on risk ranking classification determined by legislation or state regulator additionally the rcra required closure timing depends upon meeting or continuing to meet certain criterion the closure and ccr management work progress and final closure plan and corrective action measure are developed and approved at each site the scope and complexity of work and the amount of ccr material could be greater than estimate and could therefore materially increase compliance expenditure and rate impact the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation and cash flow may be negatively affected by lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customer or decline in customer demand or number of customer growth in customer account and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facility customer growth and customer usage are affected by number of factor outside the control of the duke energy registrant such mandated energy efficiency measure demand side management goal distributed generation resource and economic and demographic condition such population change job and income growth housing start new business formation and the overall level of economic activity certain regulatory and legislative body have introduced or are considering requirement and or incentive to reduce energy consumption by certain date additionally technological advance driven by federal law mandating new level of energy efficiency in end use electric device or other improvement in or application of technology could lead to decline in per caput energy consumption advance in distributed generation technology that produce power including fuel cell microturbines wind turbine and solar cell may reduce the cost of alternative method of producing power to level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the duke energy registrant some or all of these factor could result in lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customer and may cause the failure of the duke energy registrant to fully realize anticipated benefit from significant capital investment and expenditure which could have material adverse effect on their financial position result of operation and cash flow furthermore the duke energy registrant currently have energy efficiency rider in place to recover the cost of energy efficiency program in north carolina south carolina florida indiana ohio and kentucky should the duke energy registrant be required to invest in conservation measure that result in reduced sale from effective conservation regulatory lag in adjusting rate for the impact of these measure could have negative financial impact the duke energy registrant operating result may fluctuate on seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by change in weather condition and severe weather including extreme weather condition associated with climate change electric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal business in most part of the the demand for power peak during the warmer summer month with market price also typically peaking at that time in other area demand for power peak during the winter demand for natural gas peak during the winter month further extreme weather condition such heat wave winter storm and severe weather associated with climate change could cause these seasonal fluctuation to be more pronounced result the overall operating result of the duke energy registrant business may fluctuate substantially on seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period to period comparison le relevant sustained severe drought condition could impact generation by hydroelectric plant well fossil and nuclear plant operation these facility use water for cooling purpose and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment furthermore destruction caused by severe weather event such hurricane tornado severe thunderstorm snow and ice storm can result in lost operating revenue due to outage property damage including downed transmission and distribution line and additional and unexpected expense to mitigate storm damage the cost of storm restoration effort may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process the duke energy registrant sale may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate reliable and affordable access to transmission asset the duke energy registrant depend on transmission and distribution facility owned and operated by utility and other energy company to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market the ferc power transmission regulation require wholesale electric transmission service to be offered on an open access non discriminatory basis if transmission is disrupted or if transmission capacity is inadequate the duke energy registrant ability to sell and deliver product may be hindered the different regional power market have changing regulatory structure which could affect growth and performance in these region in addition the isos who oversee the transmission system in regional power market have imposed in the past and may impose in the future price limitation and other mechanism to address volatility in the power market these type of price limitation and other mechanism may adversely impact the profitability of the duke energy registrant wholesale power marketing business iduke energy may be unable to complete necessary or desirable pipeline expansion or infrastructure development or maintenance project which may delay or prevent the duke energy registrant from serving natural gas customer or expanding the natural gas business in order to serve current or new natural gas customer or expand the service to existing customer the duke energy registrant need to maintain expand or upgrade distribution transmission and or storage infrastructure including laying new pipeline and building compressor station duke energy registrant have made significant investment in number of pipeline development project which are being operated and constructed by third party joint venture partner various factor such the inability to obtain required approval from local state and or federal regulatory and governmental body public opposition to project inability to obtain adequate financing competition for labor and material construction delay cost overrun and the inability to negotiate acceptable agreement relating to right of way construction or other material development component may prevent or delay the completion of project or increase cost result the duke energy registrant may be unable to adequately serve existing natural gas customer or support customer growth or could incur higher than anticipated cost which could have negative financial impact the availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease the duke energy registrant purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate source that must be transported to the applicable service territory interstate pipeline company transport the natural gas to the duke energy registrant system under firm service agreement that are designed to meet the requirement of their core market significant disruption to interstate pipeline capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to event including but not limited to operational failure or disruption hurricane tornado flood freeze off of natural gas well terrorist or cyberattacks or other act of war or legislative or regulatory action or requirement including remediation related to integrity inspection could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings moreover if additional natural gas infrastructure including but not limited to exploration and drilling rig and platform processing and gathering system off shore pipeline interstate pipeline and storage can not be built at pace that meet demand growth opportunity could be limited and earnings negatively impacted fluctuation in commodity price or availability may adversely affect various aspect of the duke energy registrant operation well their financial condition result of operation and cash flow the duke energy registrant are exposed to the effect of market fluctuation in the price of natural gas coal fuel oil nuclear fuel electricity and other energy related commodity result of their ownership of energy related asset fuel cost are recovered primarily through cost recovery clause subject to the approval of state utility commission additionally the duke energy registrant are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligation disruption in the delivery of fuel including disruption result of among other thing transportation delay weather labor relation force majeure event or environmental regulation affecting any of these fuel supplier could limit the duke energy registrant ability to operate their facility should counterparties fail to perform the duke energy registrant might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market price possibly resulting in loss in addition to the amount if any already paid to the counterparties certain of the duke energy registrant hedge agreement may result in the receipt of or posting of derivative collateral with counterparties depending on the daily derivative position fluctuation in commodity price that lead to the return of collateral received and or the posting of collateral with counterparties negatively impact liquidity downgrade in the duke energy registrant credit rating could lead to additional collateral posting requirement the duke energy registrant continually monitor derivative position in relation to market price activity potential terrorist activity or military or other action could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business the continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the and it ally may lead to increased political economic and financial market instability and volatility in price for natural gas and oil which may have material adverse effect in way the duke energy registrant can not predict at this time in addition future act of terrorism and possible reprisal consequence of action by the and it ally could be directed company operating in the information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility such nuclear plant could be potential target of terrorist activity or harmful activity by individual or group the potential for terrorism ha subjected the duke energy registrant operation to increased risk and could have material adverse effect on their business in particular the duke energy registrant may experience increased capital and operating cost to implement increased security for their information technology system transmission and distribution and generation facility including nuclear power plant under the nrc design basis threat requirement these increased cost could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following terrorist incident cyberattacks and data security breach could adversely affect the duke energy registrant business information security risk have generally increased in recent year result of the proliferation of new technology and the increased sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breach the utility industry requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology system and network infrastructure which are part of an interconnected regional grid additionally connectivity to the internet continues to increase through smart grid and other initiative because of the critical nature of the infrastructure increased connectivity to the internet and technology system inherent vulnerability to disability or failure due to hacking virus act of war or terrorism or other type of data security breach the duke energy registrant face heightened risk of cyberattack in the event of such an attack the duke energy registrant could have business operation disrupted property damaged customer information stolen and other private information accessed ii experience substantial loss of revenue repair and restoration cost implementation cost for additional security measure to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and iii be subject to increased regulation litigation and reputational damage ifailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant result of operation certain event such an aging workforce mismatch of skill set or complement to future need or unavailability of contract resource may lead to operating challenge and increased cost the challenge include lack of resource loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development in this case cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost may increase failure to hire and adequately train replacement employee including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employee or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business especially considering the workforce need associated with nuclear generation facility and new skill required to operate modernized technology enabled power grid if the duke energy registrant are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce their financial position result of operation or cash flow could be negatively affected the cost of retiring duke energy florida crystal river unit could prove to be more extensive than is currently identified cost to retire and decommission the plant could exceed estimate and if not recoverable through the regulatory process could adversely affect duke energy progress energy and duke energy florida financial condition result of operation and cash flow duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana membership in an rto present risk that could have material adverse effect on their result of operation financial condition and cash flow the rule governing the various regional power market may change which could affect duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana cost and or revenue to the degree duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana incur significant additional fee and increased cost to participate in an rto their result of operation may be impacted duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be allocated portion of the cost of transmission facility built by others due to change in rto transmission rate design duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decision made by an rto rather than their own internal planning process while rto transmission rate were initially designed to be revenue neutral various proposal and proceeding currently taking place by the ferc may cause transmission rate to change from time to time in addition rtos have been developing rule associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning cost associated with improved transmission reliability reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission right that may have financial impact on duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana member of an rto duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are subject to certain additional risk including those associated with the allocation among rto member of loss caused by unreimbursed default of other participant in the rto market and those associated with complaint case filed against an rto that may seek refund of revenue previously earned by rto member the duke energy registrant may not recover cost incurred to begin construction on project that are canceled duke energy long term strategy requires the construction of new project either wholly owned or partially owned which involve number of risk including construction delay nonperformance by equipment and other third party supplier and increase in equipment and labor cost to limit the risk of these construction project the duke energy registrant enter into equipment purchase order and construction contract and incur engineering and design service cost in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approval and or siting or environmental permit if any of these project are canceled for any reason including failure to receive necessary regulatory approval and or siting or environmental permit significant cancellation penalty under the equipment purchase order and construction contract could occur in addition if any construction work or investment have been recorded an asset an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled nuclear generation risksduke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida may incur substantial cost and liability due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facility ownership interest in and operation of nuclear station by duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida subject them to various risk these risk include among other thing the potential harmful effect on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facility and the storage handling and disposal of radioactive material limitation on the amount and type of insurance commercially available to cover loss that might arise in connection with nuclear operation and uncertainty with respect to the technological and financial aspect of decommissioning nuclear plant at the end of their licensed life ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility requires compliance with licensing and safety related requirement imposed by the nrc in the event of non compliance the nrc may increase regulatory oversight impose fine or shut down unit depending upon it assessment of the severity of the situation revised security and safety requirement promulgated by the nrc which could be prompted by among other thing event within or outside of the control of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida such serious nuclear incident at facility owned by third party could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditure well assessment to cover third party loss in addition if serious nuclear incident were to occur it could have material adverse effect on the result of operation financial condition cash flow and reputation of the duke energy registrant iliquidity capital requirement and common stock risksthe duke energy registrant rely on access to short term borrowing and longer term debt and equity market to finance their capital requirement and support their liquidity need access to those market can be adversely affected by number of condition many of which are beyond the duke energy registrant control the duke energy registrant business are significantly financed through issuance of debt and equity the maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investment often doe not correlate to cash flow from their asset accordingly source of liquidity for capital requirement not satisfied by the cash flow from their operation and to fund investment originally financed through debt instrument with disparate maturity the duke energy registrant rely on access to short term money market well longer term capital market the subsidiary registrant also rely on access to short term intercompany borrowing if the duke energy registrant are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rate or at all the ability to finance their operation and implement their strategy and business plan scheduled could be adversely affected an inability to access debt and equity may limit the duke energy registrant ability to pursue improvement or acquisition that they may otherwise rely on for future growth market disruption may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial market such disruption could include economic downturn the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company unfavorable capital market condition market price for electricity and natural gas actual or threatened terrorist attack or the overall health of the energy industry the availability of credit under duke energy master credit facility depends upon the ability of the bank providing commitment under the facility to provide fund when their obligation to do so arise systematic risk of the banking system and the financial market could prevent bank from meeting it obligation under the facility agreement duke energy maintains revolving credit facility to provide backup for it commercial paper program and letter of credit to support variable rate demand tax exempt bond that may be put to the duke energy registrant issuer at the option of the holder the facility includes borrowing sublimits for the duke energy registrant each of is party to the credit facility and financial covenant that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding percentage of the total capital for the specific entity failure to maintain these covenant at particular entity could preclude duke energy from issuing commercial paper or the duke energy registrant from issuing letter of credit or borrowing under the master credit facility the duke energy registrant must meet credit quality standard and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit rating if the duke energy registrant are unable to maintain investment grade credit rating they would be required under credit agreement to provide collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash which may materially adversely affect their liquidity each of the duke energy registrant senior long term debt issuance is currently rated investment grade by various rating agency the duke energy registrant can not ensure their senior long term debt will be rated investment grade in the future if the rating agency were to rate the duke energy registrant below investment grade borrowing cost would increase perhaps significantly in addition the potential pool of investor and funding source would likely decrease further if the short term debt rating were to fall access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letter of credit or cash under various credit commodity and capacity agreement and trigger termination clause in some interest rate derivative agreement which would require cash payment all of these event would likely reduce the duke energy registrant liquidity and profitability and could have material effect on their financial position result of operation or cash flow non compliance with debt covenant or condition could adversely affect the duke energy registrant ability to execute future borrowing the duke energy registrant debt and credit agreement contain various financial and other covenant failure to meet those covenant beyond applicable grace period could result in accelerated due date and or termination of the agreement market performance and other change may decrease the value of the ndtf investment of duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida which then could require significant additional funding ownership and operation of nuclear generation facility also requires the maintenance of funded trust that are intended to pay for the decommissioning cost of the respective nuclear power plant the performance of the capital market affect the value of the asset held in trust to satisfy these future obligation duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida have significant obligation in this area and hold significant asset in these trust these asset are subject to market fluctuation and will yield uncertain return which may fall below projected rate of return although number of factor impact funding requirement decline in the market value of the asset may increase the funding requirement of the obligation for decommissioning nuclear plant if duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida are unable to successfully manage their ndtf asset their financial condition result of operation and cash flow could be negatively affected ipoor investment performance of the duke energy pension plan holding and other factor impacting pension plan cost could unfavorably impact the duke energy registrant liquidity and result of operation the cost of providing non contributory defined benefit pension plan are dependent upon number of factor such the rate of return on plan asset discount rate the level of interest rate used to measure the required minimum funding level of the plan future government regulation and required or voluntary contribution made to the plan the subsidiary registrant are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligation related to these plan without sustained growth in the pension investment over time to increase the value of plan asset and depending upon the other factor impacting cost listed above duke energy could be required to fund it plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation and the subsidiary registrant proportionate share of such cash funding obligation could have material impact on the duke energy registrant financial position result of operation or cash flow duke energy is holding company and depends on the cash flow from it subsidiary to meet it financial obligation because duke energy is holding company with no operation or cash flow of it own it ability to meet it financial obligation including making interest and principal payment on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividend on it common stock is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flow of it subsidiary and the ability of those subsidiary to pay upstream dividend or to repay borrowed fund prior to funding duke energy it subsidiary have regulatory restriction and financial obligation that must be satisfied these subsidiary are separate legal entity and have no obligation to provide duke energy with fund in addition duke energy may provide capital contribution or debt financing to it subsidiary under certain circumstance which would reduce the fund available to meet it financial obligation including making interest and principal payment on outstanding indebtedness

subsidiary registrant section above for additional information on the tax act and the impact on the effective tax rate matter impacting future resultson april the epa published in the federal register rule to regulate the disposal of ccr from electric utility solid waste duke energy indiana ha interpreted the rule to identify the coal ash basin site impacted and ha assessed the amount of coal ash subject to the rule and method of compliance duke energy indiana interpretation of the requirement of the ccr rule is subject to potential legal challenge and further regulatory approval which could result in additional ash basin closure requirement higher cost of compliance and greater aros additionally duke energy indiana ha retired facility that are not subject to the ccr rule duke energy indiana may incur cost at these facility to comply with environmental regulation or to mitigate risk associated with on site storage of coal ash an order from regulatory authority disallowing recovery of cost related to closure of ash basin could have an adverse impact on duke energy indiana financial position result of operation and cash flow see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for additional information in august the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc approved settlement agreement between duke energy indiana and multiple party that resolve all dispute claim and issue from the iurc proceeding related to post commercial operating performance and recovery of ongoing operating and capital cost at the edwardsport igcc generating facility the settlement agreement imposed cost cap for retail recoverable operation and maintenance cost through an inability to manage future operating cost may result in unfavorable order that could have an adverse impact on duke energy indiana financial position result of operation and cash flow within this item see the tax cut and job act above well liquidity and capital resource below for risk associated with the tax act iipiedmont introductionmanagement discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statement and note for the year ended december piedmont annual report on form for the year ended october and the form qt of december for the transition period from november to december the unaudited result of operation for the year ended december wa derived from data previously reported in the report noted above basis of presentationthe result of operation and variance discussion for piedmont is presented in reduced disclosure format in accordance with general instruction of form result of operation year ended december in million varianceoperating revenue regulated natural gas natural gas and total operating expense cost of natural maintenance and depreciation and and other operating in loss earnings of unconsolidated affiliate gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate other income and expense net total other income and

represent billed and unbilled sale amount are not weather normalized increase decrease over prior delivery commercial delivery industrial delivery power generation delivery for resale total throughput delivery secondary market volume average number of piedmont throughput wa dekatherms and dekatherms for the year ended december and respectively due to the margin decoupling mechanism in north carolina and weather normalization adjustment wna mechanism in south carolina and tennessee change in throughput delivery do not have material impact on piedmont revenue or earnings the margin decoupling mechanism adjusts for variation in residential and commercial use per customer including those due to weather and conservation the wna mechanism mostly offset the impact of weather on bill rendered but do not ensure full recovery of approved margin during period when winter weather is significantly warmer or colder than normal iiyear ended december compared to operating revenue the variance wa driven primarily by million increase due to higher natural gas cost passed through to customer primarily due to higher natural gas price million increase in revenue to residential and commercial customer net of natural gas cost passed through to customer primarily due to integrity management rider imr rate adjustment and customer growth increase is also due to new power generation customer and is partially offset by wholesale marketing revenue and million increase in revenue due to merger related bill credit applied to customer bill in operating expense the variance wa driven by million increase in cost of natural gas primarily due to higher natural gas cost passed through to customer due to the higher price per dekatherm of natural gas million increase in depreciation expense and property and franchise tax due to additional plant in service and million increase due to an impairment of software resulting from planned accounting system and process integration in partially offset by million decrease in operation maintenance and other related to acquisition and integration expense recorded in the prior year from cost paid to outside party primarily financial and legal advisory severance expense retention cost and acceleration of incentive plan and an accrual for our commitment of charitable contribution and community support other income and expense the variance wa driven by million decrease in gain on sale of unconsolidated affiliate recorded in the prior year due to piedmont sale of it percent ownership interest in southstar energy service llc southstar on october and million decrease in equity in loss earnings of unconsolidated affiliate primarily due to equity earnings from the investment in southstar in the prior year and the impact of the tax act in the current year income tax expense the variance wa primarily due to decrease in pretax income and the impact of the tax act see the subsidiary registrant section above for additional information on the tax act and the impact on the effective tax rate matter impacting future resultswithin this item see the tax cut and job act above well liquidity and capital resource below for risk associated with the tax act critical accounting policy and estimatespreparation of financial statement requires the application of accounting policy judgment assumption and estimate that can significantly affect the reported result of operation cash flow or the amount of asset and liability recognized in the financial statement judgment made include the likelihood of success of particular project possible legal and regulatory challenge earnings assumption on pension and other benefit fund investment and anticipated recovery of cost especially through regulated operation management discus these policy estimate and assumption with senior member of management on regular basis and provides periodic update on management decision to the audit committee of the board of director management belief the area described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimate and assumption that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent period for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement summary of significant accounting policy regulated operation accountingsubstantially all of duke energy regulated operation meet the criterion for application of regulated operation accounting treatment result duke energy is required to record asset and liability that would not be recorded for nonregulated entity regulatory asset generally represent incurred cost that have been deferred because such cost are probable of future recovery in customer rate regulatory liability are recorded when it is probable that regulator will require duke energy to make refund to customer or reduce rate to customer for previous collection or deferred revenue for cost that have yet to be incurred management continually ass whether recorded regulatory asset are probable of future recovery by considering factor such applicable regulatory environment change historical regulatory treatment for similar cost in duke energy jurisdiction litigation of rate order recent rate order to other regulated entity level of actual return on equity compared to approved rate of return on equity and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation if future recovery of cost cease to be probable asset write offs would be recognized in operating income additionally regulatory agency can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property plant and equipment recognition of asset retirement cost and amortization of regulatory asset or may disallow recovery of all or portion of certain asset for further information on regulatory asset and liability see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter iias required by regulated operation accounting rule significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost such closure cost for ash impoundment qualifies to be deferred for future recovery regulatory asset significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenue previously recognized are for entity specific cost that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore regulatory liability see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for more in depth discussion of regulatory asset and liability regulated operation accounting rule also require recognition of disallowance also called impairment loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of plant under construction or recently completed or an abandoned plant will be disallowed for ratemaking purpose and reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made for example if cost cap is set for plant still under construction the amount of the disallowance is result of judgment to the ultimate cost of the plant other disallowances can require judgment on allowed future rate recovery see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter for discussion of disallowances recorded when it becomes probable that regulated asset will be abandoned the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service the value that may be retained regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amount that may be recovered through regulated rate including any return such an impairment charge if any could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable the impairment for disallowance of cost for regulated plant under construction recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flow for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter goodwill impairment assessmentsduke energy allocates goodwill to reporting unit which are either the business segment listed in note to the consolidated financial statement or one level below based on how the business segment is managed duke energy is required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if it is more likely than not that the fair value is le than the carrying value duke energy performs it annual impairment test of august application of the goodwill impairment test requires management judgment including determining the fair value of the reporting unit which management estimate using weighted combination of the income approach which estimate fair value based on discounted cash flow and the market approach which estimate fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industry significant assumption used in these fair value analysis include discount and growth rate future rate of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation utility sector market performance and transaction forecasted earnings base projected operating and capital cash flow for duke energy business and the fair value of debt estimated future cash flow under the income approach are based to large extent on duke energy internal business plan and adjusted appropriate for duke energy view of market participant assumption duke energy internal business plan reflects management assumption related to customer usage and attrition based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party source projected commodity pricing data and potential change in environmental regulation the business plan assumes the occurrence of certain event in the future such the outcome of future rate filing future approved rate of return on equity anticipated earnings return related to significant future capital investment continued recovery of cost of service the renewal of certain contract and the future of renewable tax credit management also make assumption regarding operation maintenance and general and administrative cost based on the expected outcome of the aforementioned event in estimating cash flow duke energy incorporates expected growth rate regulatory and economic stability the ability to renew contract and other factor into it revenue and expense forecast one of the most significant assumption that duke energy utilizes in determining the fair value of it reporting unit under the income approach is the discount rate applied to the estimated future cash flow management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of it reporting unit based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc for each individual reporting unit the wacc take into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity major component of the cost of equity is the current risk free rate on year treasury bond in the impairment test duke energy considered implied waccs for certain peer company in determining the appropriate wacc rate to use in it analysis each reporting unit ha different risk profile based on the nature of it operation including factor such regulation the wacc for each reporting unit may differ accordingly the waccs were adjusted appropriate to account for company specific risk premium the discount rate used for calculating the fair value of august for each of duke energy reporting unit ranged from percent to percent the underlying assumption and estimate are made of point in time subsequent change particularly change in the discount rate authorized regulated rate of return or growth rate inherent in management estimate of future cash flow could result in future impairment charge one of the most significant assumption utilized in determining the fair value of reporting unit under the market approach is implied market multiple for certain peer company management selects comparable peer based on each peer primary business mix operation and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiple based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market value of august in december duke energy disposed of it international operation and no longer ha goodwill associated with the international operation for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement acquisition and disposition duke energy primarily operates in environment that are rate regulated in such environment revenue requirement are adjusted periodically by regulator based on factor including level of cost sale volume and cost of capital accordingly duke energy regulated utility operate to some degree with buffer from the direct effect positive or negative of significant swing in market or economic condition however significant change in discount rate over prolonged period may have material impact on the fair value of equity of august all of the reporting unit estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity except for the commercial renewables reporting unit the goodwill at the energy management solution reporting unit of commercial renewables wa evaluated for recoverability in and duke energy recorded impairment charge of million iithe commercial renewables reporting unit are impacted by multitude of factor including legislative action related to tax credit extension long term growth rate assumption and discount rate of august the renewables reporting unit estimated fair value of equity exceeded the carrying value of equity by le than percent management continues to monitor these assumption for any indicator that the fair value of the reporting unit could be below the carrying value and will ass goodwill for impairment appropriate for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement goodwill and intangible asset asset retirement obligationsaros are recognized for legal obligation associated with the retirement of property plant and equipment substantially all aros are related to regulated operation when recording an aro the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred if reasonable estimate of fair value can be made the liability is accreted over time for operating plant the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset for retired plant the present value of the liability is recorded regulatory asset unless determined not to be recoverable the present value of the initial obligation and subsequent update are based on discounted cash flow which include estimate regarding timing of future cash flow selection of discount rate and cost escalation rate among other factor these estimate are subject to change depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any change to the carrying amount of the associated asset the duke energy registrant receive amount to fund the cost of the aro for regulated operation through combination of regulated revenue and earnings on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund ndtf result accretion expense and depreciation of the associated aro asset are netted and deferred regulatory asset or liability obligation for nuclear decommissioning are based on site specific cost study duke energy carolina and duke energy progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facility after operation are ceased duke energy florida assumes crystal river unit will be placed into safe storage configuration until eventual dismantlement is completed by duke energy carolina duke energy progress and duke energy florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on site until such time that it can be transferred to yet to be built department of energy doe facility obligation for closure of ash basin are based upon discounted cash flow of estimated cost for site specific plan if known or probability weighting of the potential closure method if the closure plan are under development and multiple closure option are being considered and evaluated on site by site basis for further information see note to the consolidated financial statement asset retirement obligation long lived asset impairment assessment excluding regulated operation and equity method investmentsproperty plant and equipment excluding plant held for sale is stated at the lower of carrying value historical cost le accumulated depreciation and previously recorded impairment or fair value if impaired duke energy evaluates property plant and equipment for impairment when event or change in circumstance such significant change in cash flow projection or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold indicate the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable the determination of whether an impairment ha occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset compared with their carrying value performing an impairment evaluation involves significant degree of estimation and judgment in area such identifying circumstance that indicate an impairment may exist identifying and grouping affected asset and developing the undiscounted future cash flow if an impairment ha occurred the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value additionally determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flow to reflect expectation about possible variation in their amount or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate although cash flow estimate are based on relevant information available at the time the estimate are made estimate of future cash flow are by nature highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual result when determining whether an asset or asset group ha been impaired management group asset at the lowest level that ha discrete cash flow investment in affiliate that are not controlled by duke energy but over which it ha significant influence are accounted for using the equity method equity method investment are assessed for impairment when condition exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is le than book value it the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary the investment is written down to it estimated fair value which establishes new cost basis in the investment for further information see note and to the consolidated financial statement property plant and equipment and investment in unconsolidated affiliate respectively revenue recognition revenue on sale of electricity and natural gas are recognized when service is provided or the product is delivered retail meter are read invoice are prepared and the invoice amount is generally recognized billed revenue operating revenue also include unbilled electric and natural gas revenue for the amount of service provided or product delivered after the last meter reading prior to the end of the accounting period unbilled retail revenue are estimated by applying an average revenue per kilowatt hour kwh per thousand cubic foot mcf or per dekatherm dth for all customer class to the number of estimated kwh mcf or dth delivered but not yet billed for wholesale customer the invoice amount is generally recognized billed revenue although meter are read of the end of the month invoice have typically not been prepared an estimate of the wholesale invoice is included in the reported amount of unbilled revenue iithe amount of unbilled revenue can vary significantly from period to period result of numerous factor that impact the change in the unbilled revenue receivable balance including seasonality weather customer usage pattern customer mix timing of rendering customer bill meter reading schedule and the average price in effect for customer class pension and other post retirement benefitsthe calculation of pension expense other post retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post retirement asset or liability require the use of assumption and election of permissible accounting alternative change in assumption can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amount and future actual experience can differ from the assumption duke energy belief the most critical assumption for pension and other post retirement benefit are the expected long term rate of return on plan asset and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payment additionally the health care cost trend rate assumption is critical to duke energy estimate of other post retirement benefit duke energy elect to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amount that are in excess of percent of the greater of the market related value of plan asset or the plan projected benefit obligation into net pension or other post retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participant expected to benefit under the plan if all or almost all of plan participant are inactive the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participant is used instead of average remaining service period prior service cost or credit which represents an increase or decrease in plan pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment is amortized on straight line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participant expected to benefit under the plan if all or almost all of plan participant are inactive the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participant is used instead of average remaining service period duke energy maintains and the subsidiary registrant participate in qualified non contributory defined benefit retirement plan most participant in the qualified plan earn benefit calculated using cash balance formula under cash balance formula plan participant accumulates retirement benefit consisting of pay credit based upon percentage which varies with age and year of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credit certain plan participant earn benefit that use final average earnings formula certain executive are participant in non qualified non contributory defined benefit retirement plan these qualified and non qualified non contributory defined benefit plan are closed to new participant duke energy provides some health care and life insurance benefit for retired employee on contributory and non contributory basis certain employee are eligible for these benefit if they have met age and service requirement at retirement defined in the plan asset for duke energy qualified pension and other post retirement benefit account are maintained in the duke energy master retirement trust master trust duke energy also invests other post retirement asset in voluntary employee beneficiary association trust the investment objective is to achieve sufficient return subject to prudent level of portfolio risk for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefit for participant of december duke energy assumes pension and other post retirement plan asset will generate long term rate of return of percent the expected long term rate of return wa developed using weighted average calculation of expected return based primarily on future expected return across asset class considering the use of active asset manager where applicable the asset allocation target were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile equity security are held for their higher expected return debt security are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability hedge fund real estate and other global security are held for diversification investment within asset class are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual manager on investment in duke energy adopted de risking investment strategy for the master trust the funded status of the pension plan increase the targeted allocation to fixed income asset may be increased to better manage duke energy pension liability and reduce funded status volatility the asset allocation for the master trust is percent fixed income asset and percent return seeking asset duke energy regularly review it actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances it investment to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate duke energy discounted it future pension and other post retirement obligation using rate of percent of december discount rate used to measure benefit plan obligation for financial reporting purpose reflect rate at which pension benefit could be effectively settled of december duke energy determined it discount rate for pension and other post retirement obligation using bond selection settlement portfolio approach this approach develops discount rate by selecting portfolio of high quality corporate bond that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payment of the plan the selected bond portfolio is derived from universe of non callable corporate bond rated aa quality or higher after the bond portfolio is selected single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan projected benefit payment discounted at this rate with the market value of the bond selected future change in plan asset return assumed discount rate and various other factor related to the participant in duke energy pension and post retirement plan will impact future pension expense and liability duke energy can not predict with certainty what these factor will be in the future the following table present the approximate effect on duke energy pretax pension expense pretax other post retirement expense pension obligation and other post retirement benefit obligation if percent change in rate were to occur qualified and non other post retirement qualified pension plan plan in million effect on pretax

state return the subsidiary registrant entered into tax sharing agreement with duke energy income tax recorded represent amount the subsidiary registrant would incur separate corporation deferred income tax have been provided for temporary difference between gaap and tax base of asset and liability because the difference create taxable or tax deductible amount for future period itcs associated with regulated operation are deferred and amortized reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful life of the related property accumulated deferred income tax are valued using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized in the event of change in tax rate deferred tax asset and liability are remeasured of the enactment date of the new rate to the extent that the change in the value of the deferred tax represents an obligation to customer the impact of the remeasurement is deferred to regulatory liability remaining impact are recorded in income from continuing operation other impact of the tax act have been recorded on provisional basis see note income tax for additional information if duke energy estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary difference is not reflective of actual outcome is modified to reflect new development or interpretation of the tax law revised to incorporate new accounting principle or change in the expected timing or manner of the reversal then duke energy result of operation could be impacted liquidity and capital resourcessources and us of cashduke energy relies primarily upon cash flow from operation debt and equity issuance and it existing cash and cash equivalent to fund it liquidity and capital requirement duke energy capital requirement arise primarily from capital and investment expenditure repaying long term debt and paying dividend to shareholder duke energy projected primary source and us for the next three fiscal year are included in the table below in million capital expenditure maturity and reduction in short term debt payment net cash flow from operation issuance and increase in short term debt issuance excludes capital lease duke energy project reduction in short term debt in subject to approval by the board of director duke energy project an increase in short term debt in and equity

common stock for additional information iiamong other provision the tax act lower the corporate federal income tax rate from percent to percent and eliminates bonus depreciation for regulated utility for duke energy regulated operation the reduction in federal income tax is expected to result in lower regulated customer rate however due to it existing nol net operating loss position and other tax credit duke energy doe not expect to be significant federal cash tax payer through at least result any reduction in customer rate could cause material reduction in consolidated cash flow from operation in the short term over time the reduction in deferred tax liability resulting from the tax act will increase duke energy regulated rate base investment and customer rate see the credit rating section below for additional information on the impact of the tax act on the duke energy registrant credit rating impact of tax act to duke energy cash flow and credit metric are subject to the

it balance sheet and credit metric and bolster cash flow duke energy plan to issue billion of common stock equity during including it previous plan to issue million annually through it drip beginning in well reduce it capital expenditure during by approximately billion the subsidiary registrant generally maintain minimal cash balance and use short term borrowing to meet their working capital need and other cash requirement the subsidiary registrant excluding progress energy support their short term borrowing need through participation with duke energy and certain of it other subsidiary in money pool arrangement the company with short term fund may provide short term loan to affiliate participating under this arrangement see note to the consolidated financial statement debt and credit facility for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement duke energy and the subsidiary registrant excluding progress energy may also use short term debt including commercial paper and the money pool bridge to long term debt financing the level of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long term debt financing and the impact of fluctuation in cash flow from operation from time to time duke energy current liability exceed current asset resulting from the use of short term debt funding source to meet scheduled maturity of long term debt well

is no assurance to the amount of future dividend because they depend on future earnings capital requirement financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the board of director duke energy target dividend payout ratio of between percent and percent based upon adjusted diluted eps in and duke energy increased the dividend by approximately percent annually through the annual dividend growth rate is expected to be between approximately to percent iidividend and other funding restriction of duke energy subsidiariesas discussed in note to the consolidated financial statement regulatory matter duke energy wholly owned public utility operating company have restriction on the amount of fund that can be transferred to duke energy through dividend advance or loan result of condition imposed by various regulator in conjunction with merger transaction duke energy progress and duke energy florida also have restriction imposed by their first mortgage bond indenture and article of incorporation which in certain circumstance limit their ability to make cash dividend or distribution on common stock additionally certain other duke energy subsidiary have other restriction such minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirement pursuant to debt and other agreement that limit the amount of fund that can be transferred to duke energy at december the amount of restricted net asset of wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy that may not be distributed to duke energy in the form of loan or dividend is le than percent of duke energy net asset duke energy doe not have any legal or other restriction on paying common stock dividend to shareholder out of it consolidated equity account although these restriction cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiary can provide to duke energy management doe not believe these restriction will have significant impact on duke energy ability to access cash to meet it payment of dividend on common stock and other future funding obligation cash flow from operating activitiescash flow from operation of electric utility and infrastructure and gas utility and infrastructure are primarily driven by sale of electricity and natural gas respectively and cost of operation these cash flow from operation are relatively stable and comprise substantial portion of duke energy operating cash flow weather condition working capital and commodity price fluctuation and unanticipated expense including unplanned plant outage storm legal cost and related settlement can affect the timing and level of cash flow from operation duke energy belief it ha sufficient liquidity resource through the commercial paper market and ultimately the master credit facility to support these operation cash flow from operation are subject to number of other factor including but not limited to regulatory constraint economic trend and market volatility see item risk factor for additional information at december duke energy had cash and cash equivalent and short term investment of million debt issuancesdepending on availability based on the issuing entity the credit rating of the issuing entity and market condition the subsidiary registrant prefer to issue first mortgage bond and secured debt followed by unsecured debt this preference is the result of generally higher credit rating for first mortgage

commodity price riskduke energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuation in the price of electricity coal natural gas and other energy related product marketed and purchased result of it ownership of energy related asset duke energy exposure to these fluctuation is limited by the cost based regulation of it regulated operation these operation are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these cost through various cost recovery clause including fuel clause formula based contract or other cost sharing mechanism while there may be delay in timing between when these cost are incurred and when they are recovered through rate change from year to year generally do not have material impact on operating result of these regulated operation price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse change in the market price of electricity or other energy commodity duke energy exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by number of factor including contract size length market liquidity location and unique or specific contract term duke energy employ established policy and procedure to manage risk associated with these market fluctuation which may include using various commodity derivative such swap future forward and option for additional information see note to the consolidated financial statement derivative and hedging the input and methodology used to determine the fair value of contract are validated by an internal group separate from duke energy deal origination function while duke energy us common industry practice to develop it valuation technique change in it pricing methodology or the underlying assumption could result in significantly different fair value and income recognition hedging strategiesduke energy closely monitor risk associated with commodity price change on it future operation and where appropriate us various commodity instrument such electricity coal and natural gas forward contract and option to mitigate the effect of such fluctuation on operation duke energy primary use of energy commodity derivative is to hedge against exposure to the price of power fuel for generation and natural gas for customer the majority of instrument used to manage duke energy commodity price exposure are either not designated hedge or do not qualify for hedge accounting these instrument are referred to undesignated contract mark to market change for undesignated contract entered into by regulated business are reflected regulatory asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet undesignated contract entered into by unregulated business are marked to market each period with change in the fair value of the derivative instrument reflected in earnings duke energy may also enter into other contract that qualify for the npns exception when contract meet the criterion to qualify npns duke energy applies such exception income recognition and realization related to npns contract generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity for contract qualifying for the npns exception no recognition of the contract fair value in the consolidated financial statement is required until settlement of the contract long the transaction remains probable of occurring generation portfolio risk the duke energy registrant optimize the value of their generation portfolio which include generation asset fuel and emission allowance modeled forecast of future generation output and fuel requirement are based on forward power and fuel market the component piece of the portfolio are bought and sold based on model and forecast of generation in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio in accordance with the strategy of the business unit iifor the electric utility segment the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operation or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuation however the impact on the consolidated statement of operation is partially offset by mechanism in these regulated jurisdiction that result in the sharing of net profit from these activity with retail customer interest rate riskduke energy is exposed to risk resulting from change in interest rate result of it issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper duke energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable rate exposure to percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effect of market change in interest rate duke energy also enters into financial derivative instrument which may include instrument such but not limited to interest rate swap swaptions and treasury lock agreement to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure see note and to the consolidated financial statement summary of significant accounting policy debt and credit facility derivative and hedging and fair value measurement at december duke energy had million notional amount of floating to fixed swap outstanding million notional amount of fixed to floating swap outstanding and million forward starting swap outstanding duke energy had billion of unhedged long and short term floating interest rate exposure at december the impact of basis point change in interest rate on pretax income is approximately million at december this amount wa estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on variable rate security outstanding adjusted for interest rate hedge of december see note derivative and hedging to the consolidated financial statement for additional information about the forward starting interest rate swap related to the piedmont acquisition credit riskcredit risk represents the loss that the duke energy registrant would incur if counterparty fails to perform under it contractual obligation where exposed to credit risk the duke energy registrant analyze the counterparty financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis the duke energy registrant establish credit limit where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangement and monitor such limit to reduce credit exposure the duke energy registrant seek to include netting provision with counterparties which permit the offset of receivables and payable with such counterparties the duke energy registrant also frequently use master agreement with credit support annex to further mitigate certain credit exposure the master agreement provide for counterparty to post cash or letter of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold the threshold amount represents negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement determined in accordance with the duke energy registrant internal corporate credit practice and standard collateral agreement generally also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contract and liquidate all position the duke energy registrant also obtain cash or letter of credit from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreement where appropriate based on financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual term and condition applicable to each transaction see note to the consolidated financial statement derivative and hedging for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instrument the duke energy registrant principal counterparties for it electric and natural gas business are regional transmission organization distribution company municipality electric cooperative and utility located throughout the the duke energy registrant have concentration of receivables from such entity throughout these region these concentration of receivables may affect the duke energy registrant overall credit risk in that risk factor can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector the duke energy registrant are also subject to credit risk from transaction with their supplier that involve prepayment in conjunction with outsourcing arrangement major construction project and certain commodity purchase the duke energy registrant credit exposure to such supplier may take the form of increased cost or project delay in the event of non performance the duke energy registrant frequently require guarantee or letter of credit from supplier to mitigate this credit risk credit risk associated with the duke energy registrant service to residential commercial and industrial customer is generally limited to outstanding account receivable the duke energy registrant mitigate this credit risk by requiring customer to provide cash deposit letter of credit or surety bond until satisfactory payment history is established subject to the rule and regulation in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded charge offs for retail customer have historically been insignificant to the operation of the duke energy registrant and are typically recovered through retail rate management continually monitor customer charge offs and payment pattern to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserve duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana sell certain

numerous party have filed petition with the circuit court challenging various aspect of the csapr update rule final brief in the case are due april the date for oral argument ha not been established the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of these matter carbon pollution standard for new modified and reconstructed power plantson october epa published final rule in the federal register establishing carbon dioxide emission limit for new modified and reconstructed power plant the requirement for new plant apply to plant that commenced construction after january epa set an emission standard for coal unit of pound of per gross mwh which would require the application of partial carbon capture and storage cc technology for coal unit to be able to meet the limit utility scale cc is not currently demonstrated and commercially available technology for coal fired egus and therefore the final standard effectively prevents the development of new coal fired generation epa set final standard of pound of per gross mwh for new natural gas combined cycle unit on march president trump signed an executive order directing epa to review the rule and determine whether to suspend revise or rescind it on the same day the department of justice doj filed motion with the circuit court requesting that the court stay the litigation of the rule while it is reviewed by epa subsequent to the doj motion the circuit court canceled oral argument in the case on august the court ordered that the litigation be suspended indefinitely the rule remains in effect pending the outcome of litigation and epa review epa ha not announced schedule for completing it review the duke energy registrant can not predict the outcome of these matter but do not expect the impact of the

greenhouse gas ghg emission consist primarily of and result primarily from operating fleet of coal fired and natural gas fired power plant in the duke energy registrant power plant emitted approximately million ton of future level of emission will be influenced by variable that include fuel price compliance with new or existing regulation economic condition that affect electricity demand and the technology deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet the customer demand iithe duke energy registrant have taken action that have resulted in reduction of emission over time action have included the retirement of coal fired egus with combined generating capacity of mw much of that capacity ha been replaced with state of the art highly efficient natural gas fired generation that produce far fewer emission per unit of electricity generated duke energy also ha made investment to expand it portfolio of wind and solar project increase energy efficiency offering and invest in it zero emission hydropower and nuclear plant these effort have diversified it system and significantly reduced emission between and the duke energy registrant have collectively lowered the emission from their electricity generation by more than percent which lower the exposure to any future mandatory emission reduction requirement or carbon tax whether result of federal legislation epa regulation state regulation or other yet unknown emission reduction requirement duke energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce emission including energy efficiency wind solar storage nuclear and carbon sequestration duke energy will adjust to evolving and innovative technology in way that balance the reliability and affordability that customer expect under any future scenario involving mandatory limitation the duke energy registrant would plan to seek recovery of their compliance cost through appropriate regulatory mechanism the duke energy registrant recognize certain group associate severe weather event with increasing level of ghgs in the atmosphere and forecast the possibility these weather event could have material impact on future result of operation should they occur more frequently and with greater severity however the uncertain nature of potential change in extreme weather event such increased frequency duration and severity the long period of time over which any potential change might take place and the inability to predict potential change with any degree of accuracy make estimating any potential future financial risk to the duke energy registrant operation impossible the duke energy registrant have historically planned and prepared for extreme weather event such ice storm tornado hurricane severe thunderstorm high wind and drought they occasionally experience the duke energy registrant annually biannually or triennially prepare lengthy forward looking integrated resource plan irps these detailed highly technical plan are based on the company thorough analysis of numerous factor that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long term resource planning decision the irp process help to evaluate range of option taking into account forecast of future electricity demand fuel price transmission improvement new generating capacity integration of renewables energy storage energy efficiency and demand response initiative the irp process also help evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenario to better mitigate policy and economic risk the irps we file with regulator look out to year depending on the jurisdiction for number of year the duke energy registrant have included price on emission in their irp planning process to account for the potential regulation of emission incorporating price on emission in the irp allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource need against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty one of the challenge with using price especially in the absence of clear and certain policy is determining the appropriate price to use to address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile the duke energy registrant typically use range of potential price to reflect range of potential policy outcome the duke energy registrant routinely take step to reduce the potential impact of severe weather event on their electric distribution system the duke energy registrant electric generating facility are designed to withstand extreme weather event without significant damage the duke energy registrant maintain an inventory of coal and oil on site to mitigate the effect of any potential short term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customer with an uninterrupted supply of electricity north carolina legislationin july the north carolina general assembly passed house bill and it wa subsequently enacted into law by the governor the law includes among other thing overall reform of the application of public utility regulatory policy act of purpa for new solar project in the state requirement for the utility to procure approximately mw of renewable energy through competitive bidding process and recovery of cost related to the competitive bidding process through the fuel clause and competitive procurement rider the law stipulated certain deadline for duke energy to file for ncuc approval of program required under the law duke energy ha made some regulatory filing since the passage of the law and will continue to implement the requirement of house bill nuclear mattersfollowing the event at the fukushima daiichi nuclear power station in japan in march the nrc formed task force to conduct comprehensive review of process and regulation to determine whether the agency should make additional improvement to the nuclear regulatory system subsequently the nrc targeted set of

the lease standard on january duke energy is currently evaluating the financial statement impact of adopting this standard and is continuing to monitor industry implementation issue including easement pole attachment and renewable ppas other than an expected increase in asset and liability the ultimate impact of the new standard ha not yet been determined significant system enhancement including

progress llc duke energy florida llc duke energy ohio inc duke energy indiana llc piedmont natural gas company inc combined note to consolidated financial statement continued retirement benefit in march the fasb issued revised accounting guidance for the presentation of net periodic cost related to benefit plan current gaap permit the aggregation of all the component of net periodic cost on the consolidated statement of operation and doe not require the disclosure of the location of net periodic cost on the consolidated statement of operation under the amended guidance the service cost component of net periodic cost must be included within operating income within the same line other compensation expense all other component of net periodic cost must be outside of operating income in addition the updated guidance permit only the service cost component of net periodic cost to be capitalized to inventory or property plant and equipment this represents change from current gaap which permit all component of net periodic cost to be capitalized these amendment should be applied retrospectively for the presentation of the various component of net periodic cost and prospectively for the change in eligible cost to be capitalized the guidance allows for practical expedient that permit company to use amount disclosed in prior period financial statement the estimation basis for applying the retrospective presentation requirement for duke energy this guidance is effective for interim and annual period beginning january duke energy currently present the total non capitalized net periodic cost within operation maintenance and other on the consolidated statement of operation the adoption of this guidance will result in retrospective change to reclassify the presentation of the non service cost benefit component of net periodic cost to other income and expense duke energy intends to utilize the practical expedient for retrospective presentation the change in net periodic cost eligible for capitalization is applicable prospectively since duke energy service cost component is expected to be greater than the total net periodic cost the change will result in increased capitalization of net periodic cost higher operation maintenance and other and higher other income and expense the resulting impact to duke energy is expected to be an immaterial increase in net income resulting from the limitation of eligible capitalization of net periodic cost to the service cost component which is larger than the total net periodic cost acquisition and disposition

liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the fair value definition focus on an exit price versus the acquisition cost fair value measurement use market data or assumption market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumption about risk and the risk inherent in the input to the valuation technique these input may be readily observable corroborated by market data or generally unobservable valuation technique maximize the use of observable input and minimize use of unobservable input midmarket pricing convention the midpoint price between bid and ask price is permitted for use practical expedient fair value measurement are classified in three level based on the fair value hierarchy level unadjusted quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date an active market is one in which transaction for an asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide ongoing pricing information level fair value measurement utilizing input other than quoted price included in level that are observable either directly or indirectly for an asset or liability input include quoted price for similar asset or liability in active market ii quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in market that are not active and iii input other than quoted market price that are observable for the asset or liability such interest rate curve and yield curve observable at commonly quoted interval volatility and credit spread level measurement can not have more than an insignificant portion of it valuation based on unobservable input instrument in this category include non exchange traded derivative such over the counter forward swap and option certain marketable debt security and financial instrument traded in le than active market level any fair value measurement which includes unobservable input for more than an insignificant portion of the valuation these input may be used with internally developed methodology that result in management best estimate of fair value level measurement may include longer term instrument that extend into period in which observable input are not available not categorized certain investment are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy these investment are measured based on the fair value of the underlying investment but may not be readily redeemable at that fair value fair value accounting guidance permit entity to elect to measure certain financial instrument that are not required to be accounted for at fair value such equity method investment or the company own debt at fair value the duke energy registrant have not elected to record any of these item at fair value transfer between level represent asset or liability that were previously categorized at higher level for which the input to the estimate became le observable or ii classified at lower level for which the input became more observable during the period the duke energy registrant policy is to recognize transfer between level of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the period there were no transfer between level during the year ended december and in addition for piedmont there were no transfer between level during the two month ended december and the year ended october and valuation method of the primary fair value measurement disclosed below are follows investment in equity securitiesthe majority of investment in equity security are valued using level measurement investment in equity security are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market of the last business day of the quarter principal active market for equity price include published exchange such the new york stock exchange nyse and the nasdaq stock market foreign equity price are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market there wa no after hour market activity that wa required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurement investment in debt securitiesmost investment in debt security are valued using level measurement because the valuation use interest rate curve and credit spread applied to the term of the debt instrument maturity and coupon interest rate and consider the counterparty credit rating if the market for particular fixed income security is relatively inactive or illiquid the measurement is level iiduke energy corporation duke energy carolina llc progress

ohio and duke energy indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to crc these subordinated note held by duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana are stated at fair value carrying value of retained interest are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between asset sold and interest retained based on relative fair value the allocated base of the subordinated note are not materially different than their face value because the receivables generally turnover in le than two month ii credit loss are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and iii the equity in crc is subordinate to all retained interest and thus would absorb loss first the hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interest assuming both percent and percent unfavorable variation in credit loss or discount rate is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history interest accrues to duke energy ohio and duke energy indiana on the retained interest using the acceptable yield method this method generally approximates the stated rate on the note since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent an impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interest and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an otti ha
