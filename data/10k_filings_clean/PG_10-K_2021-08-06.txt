condition our product are sold in numerous country across north america europe latin america asia and africa with more than half our sale generated outside the united state such we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factor and foreign government policy and foreign exchange fluctuation current global economic condition continue to be highly volatile due to the covid pandemic resulting in market size contraction in certain country due to economic slowdown and government restriction on movement other macroeconomic factor also remain dynamic and any cause of market size contraction such greater political unrest or instability in the middle east central eastern europe certain latin american market and the hong kong market in greater china could reduce our sale or erode our operating margin in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flow change in cost our cost are subject to fluctuation particularly due to change in commodity price transportation cost and our own productivity effort we have significant exposure to certain commodity in particular certain oil derived material like resin and paper based material like pulp and volatility in the market price of these commodity input material ha direct impact on our cost disruption in our manufacturing supply and distribution operation including freight container and truck availability due to the covid pandemic may also impact our cost if we are unable to manage these impact through pricing action cost saving project and sourcing decision well through consistent productivity improvement it may adversely impact our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flow net sale could also be adversely impacted following pricing action if there is negative impact on the consumption of our product we strive to implement achieve and sustain cost improvement plan including outsourcing project supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization if we are not successful in executing and sustaining these change there could be negative impact on our gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flow foreign exchange we have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rate translation exposure relate to exchange rate impact of measuring income statement of foreign subsidiary that do not use the dollar their functional currency transaction exposure relate to the impact from input cost that are denominated in currency other than the local reporting currency and the revaluation of transaction related working capital balance denominated in currency other than the functional currency in the past three fiscal year number of foreign currency have weakened versus the dollar leading to lower earnings from these foreign exchange impact in the current fiscal year foreign exchange impact have benefited net sale while negatively impacting earnings due to the mix of currency in which input cost are denominated certain country currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuation include argentina brazil russia turkey well the european union these fluctuation have significantly impacted our historical net sale cost and net earnings and could do so in the future increased pricing in response to certain fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rate may offset portion of the currency impact but could also have negative impact on the consumption of our product which would affect our net sale gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flow government policy our net earnings and cash flow could be affected by change in or foreign government legislative regulatory or enforcement policy for example any future legislative or regulatory change in or non tax policy or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work led by the oecd for the focused on addressing the challenge of the digitalization of the economy the breadth of the oecd project extends beyond pure digital business and is likely to impact all multinational business by redefining jurisdictional taxation right our net sale gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flow may also be impacted by change in and foreign government policy related to environmental and climate change matter additionally we attempt to carefully manage our debt currency and other exposure in certain country with currency exchange import authorization and pricing control such nigeria algeria egypt argentina and turkey further our net sale gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flow could be affected by change to international trade agreement in north america and elsewhere including any change related to the united kingdom exit from the european union change in government policy in these area might cause an increase or decrease in our net sale gross margin operating margin net earnings and cash flow covid pandemic disclosure our net sale net earnings and cash flow may be impacted by the and foreign government policy to manage the covid pandemic such movement restriction or site closure the company priority during the covid pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our the procter gamble companyemployees maximizing the availability of product that help consumer with their health hygiene and cleaning need and using our employee talent and our resource to help society meet and overcome the current challenge because the company sell product that are essential to the daily life of consumer the covid pandemic ha not had materially negative impact to our consolidated net sale positive and negative impact during fiscal have largely offset each other we have experienced significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product category fabric home cleaning and hygiene product primarily in north america caused in part by changing consumer habit pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment due to the covid pandemic contributing to increase in net sale at the same time net sale have been negatively impacted due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movement in certain market in asia pacific and europe in certain channel such professional and in certain category such shave care in the future the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our product if it result in recessionary global economic environment demand in certain country in latin america asia pacific and imea may be particularly susceptible to recession it could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our product due to government action impacting our ability to produce and ship product or impacting consumer movement and access to our product the resumption of normal economic activity we emerge from the pandemic in certain market including north america could also result in reduced demand due to consumption decrease and consumer pantry destocking particularly in home cleaning and hygiene product we believe that over the long term there will continue to be strong demand for category in which we operate particularly our product that deliver essential health hygiene and cleaning benefit however the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain market in asia pacific imea and latin america the resumption of international travel the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking and product demand volatility caused by future economic trend are unclear accordingly there may be heightened volatility in net sale net earnings and cash flow during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic our retail customer are also being impacted by the pandemic their success in addressing the issue and maintaining their operation could impact consumer access to and result sale of our product our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impact will in part depend on our ability to protect our employee and our supply chain the company ha endeavored to follow action recommended by government and health authority including on vaccine administration to protect our employee worldwide with particular measure in place for those working in our plant and distribution facility we have also worked closely with local and national official to keep our manufacturing facility open due to the essential nature of the majority of our product while we have been able to broadly maintain our operation we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain market in asia pacific and imea in the first month of the pandemic due primarily to the restriction of employee movement well increased transportation and manufacturing cost we intend to continue to work with government authority and implement our employee safety measure to ensure that we continue manufacturing and distributing our product during the pandemic however uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain for example closure of key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of key material or transportation supplier to source and transport material that could impact our operation because the pandemic ha not had material negative impact on our operation on the demand for our product or the resulting net sale and net earnings it ha also not negatively impacted the company liquidity position we continue to generate operating cash flow to meet our short term liquidity need and we continue to maintain access to the capital market enabled by our strong short and long term credit rating we have also not observed any material impairment of our asset or significant change in the fair value of asset due to the covid pandemic for additional information on risk factor that could impact our result please refer to risk factor in part item of this form result of operationsthe key metric included in the discussion of our consolidated result of operation include net sale gross margin selling general and administrative cost sg operating margin other non operating item income tax and net earnings the primary factor driving year over year change in net sale include overall market growth in the category in which we compete product initiative competitive activity the level of initiative pricing and other activity by competitor marketing spending retail execution both in store and online and acquisition and divestiture activity all of which drive change in our underlying unit volume well our pricing action which can also impact volume change in product and geographic mix and foreign currency impact on sale outside the most of our cost of product sold and sg are to some extent variable in nature accordingly our discussion of these operating cost focus primarily on relative margin rather than the absolute year over year change in total cost the primary driver of change in gross margin are input cost energy and other commodity pricing impact geographic mix for example gross margin in north america are generally higher than the company average for similar product product mix for example the beauty segment ha higher gross margin than the company average foreign exchange rate fluctuation in situation where certain input cost may be tied to different functional currency than the underlying sale the impact of manufacturing saving project and reinvestments for example product or package improvement and to lesser the procter gamble company scale impact for cost that are fixed or le variable in nature the primary component of sg are marketing related cost and non manufacturing overhead cost marketing related cost are primarily variable in nature although we may achieve some level of scale benefit over time due to overall growth and other marketing efficiency while overhead cost are variable to some extent we generally experience more scale related impact for these cost due to our ability to leverage our organization and system infrastructure to support business growth the main driver of change in sg percentage of net sale are overhead and marketing cost saving reinvestments for example increased advertising inflation foreign exchange fluctuation and

corporate also includes reconciling item to adjust the accounting policy used in the reportable segment to gaap the most significant ongoing reconciling item is income tax to adjust from blended statutory rate that are reflected in the reportable segment to the overall company effective tax rate corporate net sale increased to million in fiscal due to an increase in the net sale of the

excluding this charge corporate had net earnings of million an improvement of million driven by lower restructuring charge versus the base period and the current period unrealized gain from an equity investment that became publicly traded in fiscal partially offset by higher interest expense and lower interest income in the current period each of these item have been discussed above restructuring program to deliver productivity and cost savingsthe company ha historically had an ongoing restructuring program with annual spending in the range of to million in fiscal the company initiated productivity and cost saving plan in addition to our ongoing restructuring type activity to reduce cost and better leverage scale in the area of supply chain research and development marketing and overhead in fiscal the company communicated specific element of an additional multi year productivity and cost saving program the plan wa designed to accelerate cost reduction by streamlining decision making manufacturing and other work process to both fund the company growth strategy and increase the company operating margin the plan wa substantially completed in fiscal with spending totaling approximately million in that year saving generated from the company restructuring program are difficult to estimate given the nature of the activity the timing of the execution and the degree of reinvestment however we estimate that the underlying restructuring cost incurred since approximately billion along with other non manufacturing enrollment reduction since have delivered approximately billion in annual before tax gross saving in fiscal the company incurred restructuring cost within the range of our historical ongoing level of to million annually restructuring accrual of million of june are classified current liability approximately of the restructuring charge incurred in fiscal either have been or will be settled with cash consistent with our historical policy for ongoing restructuring type activity the resulting charge are funded by and included within corporate for segment reporting in addition to our restructuring program we have additional ongoing saving effort in our supply chain marketing and overhead area that yield additional benefit to our operating margin refer to note to the consolidated financial statement for more detail on the restructuring program and to the operating cost section of the md for more information about the total benefit to operating margin from our total saving effort cash flow financial condition and liquiditywe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operation and to readily access capital market at competitive rate operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating need and capital expenditure excess operating cash is used first to fund shareholder dividend other discretionary us include share repurchase and the procter gamble company to complement our portfolio of business brand and geography necessary we may supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund these activity the overall cash position of the company reflects our strong business result and global cash management strategy that take into account liquidity management economic factor and tax consideration cash flow analysis million cash provided by operating activity net cash provided used by investing activity net cash used in financing activity adjusted free cash adjusted free cash flow operating cash flowoperating cash flow wa billion in increase from the prior year net earnings adjusted for non cash item depreciation and amortization loss on early extinguishment of debt share based compensation deferred income tax and gain on sale of asset generated approximately billion of operating cash flow working capital and other impact generated million of operating cash flow summarized below an increase in account receivable used million of cash primarily due to sale growth and lower relative sale at the end of the base period in certain market due to covid the number of day sale outstanding increased approximately day versus prior year higher inventory used million of cash primarily due to commodity cost increase and business growth inventory day on hand increased approximately day primarily due to these same factor account payable accrued and other liability increased generating billion of cash about half of this wa driven by extended payment term with our supplier see extended payment term and supply chain financing below the remaining amount wa driven by higher current period marketing spending and to support the increase in inventory day payable outstanding is approximately day of june an increase of day versus prior year due to these same factor other net operating asset and liability declined using million of cash primarily driven by the payment of the current year portion of transitional tax due related to the tax act repatriation charge million and pension related accrual and contribution adjusted free cash flow we view adjusted free cash flow an important non gaap measure because it is factor impacting the amount of cash available for dividend share repurchase acquisition and other discretionary investment it is defined operating cash flow le capital expenditure and excluding payment for the transitional tax resulting from the tax act and tax payment related to the merck acquisition adjusted free cash flow is one of the measure used to evaluate senior management and determine their at risk compensation adjusted free cash flow wa billion in an increase of versus the prior year the increase wa primarily driven by the increase in operating cash flow discussed above adjusted free cash flow productivity defined the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charge for early debt extinguishment which are not considered part of our ongoing operation wa in extended payment term and supply chain financing beginning in fiscal in response to evolving market practice the company began program to negotiate extended payment term with it supplier at the same time the company initiated supply chain finance program the scf with number of global financial institution the scf bank under the scf qualifying supplier may elect to sell their receivables from the company to scf bank these participating supplier negotiate their receivables sale arrangement directly with the respective scf bank while the company is not party to those agreement the scf bank allow the participating supplier to utilize the company creditworthiness in establishing credit spread and associated cost this generally provides the supplier with more favorable term than they would be able to secure on their own the company ha no economic interest in supplier decision to sell receivable qualifying supplier elect to participate in the scf and reach an agreement with an scf bank they elect which individual company invoice they sell to the scf bank however all the company payment to participating supplier are paid to the scf bank on the invoice due date regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the scf bank the scf bank pay the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoice that were not previously sold to the scf bank under the scf the term of the company payment obligation are not impacted by supplier participation in the scf our payment term with our supplier for similar service and material within individual market are consistent between supplier that elect to participate in the scf and those that do not participate accordingly our average day outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of supplier or related input cost that are included in the scf in addition the scf is available to both material supplier where the underlying cost are largely included in cost of good sold and to service supplier where the underlying cost are largely included in sg of june approximately of our global supplier have elected to participate in the scf payment to those supplier during fiscal year total approximately billion which equal approximately of our total cost of good sold and sg for the period for participating supplier we believe substantially all of their receivables with the the procter gamble companycompany are sold to the scf bank accordingly we would expect that at each balance sheet date similar proportion of amount originally due to supplier would instead be payable to scf bank all outstanding amount related to supplier participating in the scf are recorded within account payable in our consolidated balance sheet and the associated payment are included in operating activity within our consolidated statement of cash flow of june and the amount due to supplier participating in the scf and included in account payable were approximately billion and billion respectively although difficult to project due to market and other dynamic we anticipate incremental cash flow benefit from the extended payment term with supplier could increase at slower rate in fiscal future change in our supplier financing policy or economic development such change in interest rate general market liquidity or the company credit worthiness relative to participating supplier could impact supplier participation in the scf and or our ability to negotiate extended payment term with our supplier however any such impact are difficult to predict investing cash flownet investing activity used billion in cash in primarily due to capital spending net investing activity generated billion in cash in mainly due to proceeds from sale and maturity of investment security partially

primarily due to the issuance of bond of billion treasury purchase total share repurchase were billion in and billion in impact of stock option and other the exercise of stock option and other financing activity generated billion and billion of cash in and respectively liquidityat june our current liability exceeded current asset by billion largely due to short term borrowing under our commercial paper program we anticipate being able to support our short term liquidity and operating need largely through cash generated from operation the company regularly ass it cash need and the available source to fund these need of june the company had billion of cash and cash equivalent related to foreign subsidiary primarily in various western european and asian country we not have material cash and cash equivalent related to any country subject to exchange control that significantly restrict our ability to access or repatriate the fund under current law we do not expect restriction or tax on repatriation of cash held outside of the to have material effect on our overall liquidity financial condition or the result of operation for the foreseeable future we utilize short and long term debt to fund discretionary item such acquisition and share repurchase we have strong short and long term debt rating which have enabled and should continue to enable to refinance our debt it becomes due at favorable rate in commercial paper and bond market in addition we have agreement with diverse group of financial institution that if needed should provide sufficient funding to meet short term financing requirement the procter gamble company june our short term credit rating were moody and standard poor while our long term credit rating were moody and aa standard poor all with stable outlook we maintain bank credit facility to support our ongoing commercial paper program the current facility is an billion facility split between billion five year facility and billion day facility which expire in november and november respectively both facility can be extended for certain period of time specified in the term of the credit agreement these facility are currently undrawn and we anticipate that they will remain undrawn these credit facility do not have cross default or rating trigger do they have material adverse event clause except at the time of signing in addition to these credit facility we have an automatically effective registration statement on form filed with the sec that is available for registered offering of short or long term debt security for additional detail on debt see note to the consolidated financial statement guarantee and other balance sheet arrangementswe do not have guarantee or other off balance sheet financing arrangement

include any provision made for foreign withholding tax on expected repatriation the timing of those payment is uncertain of june the company consolidated balance sheet reflects liability for uncertain tax position of million including million of interest and penalty due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflow of liability for uncertain tax position beyond one year reasonable estimate of the period of cash settlement beyond twelve month from the balance sheet date of june can not be made represents future pension payment to comply with local funding requirement these future pension payment assume the company continues to meet it future statutory funding requirement considering the current economic environment in which the company operates the company belief it cash flow are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirement the projected payment beyond fiscal year are not currently determinable primarily reflects future contractual payment under various take or pay arrangement entered into part of the normal course of business commitment made under take or pay obligation represent minimum commitment with supplier and are in line with expected usage this includes service contract for information technology human resource management and facility management activity that have been outsourced while the amount listed represent contractual obligation we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying contract were canceled prior to maturity in such case we generally are able to negotiate new contract or cancellation penalty resulting in reduced payment the amount do not include other contractual purchase obligation that are not take or pay arrangement such contractual purchase obligation are primarily purchase order at fair value that are part of normal operation and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trend we do not believe such purchase obligation will adversely affect our liquidity position the procter gamble companysignificant accounting policy and estimatesin preparing our financial statement in accordance with gaap there are certain accounting policy that may require choice between acceptable accounting method or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application these include revenue recognition income tax certain employee benefit and goodwill and intangible asset we believe these accounting policy and others set forth in note to the consolidated financial statement should be reviewed they are integral to understanding the result of operation and financial condition of the company the company ha discussed the selection of significant accounting policy and the effect of estimate with the audit committee of the company board of director revenue recognitionour revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customer those sale predominantly contain single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at single point in time when ownership risk and reward transfer which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer trade promotion consisting primarily of customer pricing allowance in store merchandising fund advertising and other promotional activity and consumer coupon are offered through various program to customer and consumer sale are recorded net of trade promotion spending which is recognized incurred at the time of the sale amount accrued for trade promotion at the end of period require estimation based on contractual term sale volume and historical utilization and redemption rate the actual amount paid may be different from such estimate these difference which have historically not been significant are recognized change in management estimate in subsequent period income taxesour annual tax rate is determined based on our income statutory tax rate and the tax impact of item treated differently for tax purpose than for financial reporting purpose also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgement and assumption regarding the recoverability of certain deferred tax balance primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards and our ability to uphold certain tax position realization of net operating loss and other carryforwards is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward period which involves business plan planning opportunity and expectation about future outcome although realization is not assured management belief it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance will be realized we operate in multiple jurisdiction with complex tax policy and regulatory environment in certain of these jurisdiction we may take tax position that management belief are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority these interpretational difference with the respective governmental taxing authority can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment core operating principle is that our tax structure is based on our business operating model such that profit are earned in line with the business substance and function of the various legal entity in the jurisdiction where those function are performed however because of the complexity of transfer pricing concept we may have income tax uncertainty related to the determination of intercompany transfer price for our various cross border transaction we have obtained and continue to prioritize the strategy of seeking advance ruling with tax authority to reduce this uncertainty we estimate that our current portfolio of advance ruling reduces this uncertainty with respect to over of our global earnings we evaluate our tax position and establish liability in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income tax we review these tax uncertainty in light of changing fact and circumstance such the progress of tax audit and adjust them accordingly we have number of audit in process in various jurisdiction although the resolution of these tax position is uncertain based on currently available information we believe that the ultimate outcome will not have material adverse effect on our financial position result of operation or cash flow because there are number of estimate and assumption inherent in calculating the various component of our tax provision certain change or future event such change in tax legislation geographic mix of earnings completion of tax audit or earnings repatriation plan could have an impact on those estimate and our effective tax rate see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on the company income tax employee benefitswe sponsor various postretirement benefit throughout the world these include pension plan both defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan and other postretirement benefit oprb plan consisting primarily of health care and life insurance for retiree for accounting purpose the defined benefit pension and oprb plan require assumption to estimate the net projected and accumulated benefit obligation including the following variable discount rate expected salary increase certain employee related factor such turnover retirement age and mortality expected return on asset and health care cost trend rate these and other assumption affect the annual expense and net obligation recognized for the underlying plan our assumption reflect our historical experience and management best judgment regarding future expectation permitted by gaap the net amount by which actual result differ from our assumption is deferred if this net deferred amount exceeds of the greater of plan asset or liability portion of the deferred amount is included in expense for the following year the cost or benefit of plan change such increasing or decreasing benefit for prior employee service prior service the procter gamble company is deferred and included in expense on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employee expected to receive benefit the expected return on plan asset assumption impact our defined benefit expense since many of our defined benefit pension plan and our primary oprb plan are partially funded the process for setting the expected rate of return is described in note to the consolidated financial statement for the average return on asset assumption for pension plan asset and oprb asset wa and respectively change in the rate of return of basis point for both pension and oprb asset would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million since pension and oprb liability are measured on discounted basis the discount rate impact our plan obligation and expense discount rate used for our defined benefit pension and oprb plan are based on yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality bond for which the timing and amount of cash outflow approximate the estimated payouts of the plan for our international plan the discount rate are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bond rated aa or better the average discount rate on the defined benefit pension plan of represents weighted average of local rate in country where such plan exist basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after tax benefit expense by approximately million the average discount rate on the oprb plan of reflects the higher interest rate generally applicable in the which is where majority of the plan participant receive benefit basis point change in the discount rate would impact annual after tax oprb expense by approximately million see note to the consolidated financial statement for additional detail on our defined benefit pension and oprb plan goodwill and intangible assetssignificant judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill reporting unit and intangible asset accordingly we typically obtain the assistance of third party valuation specialist for significant goodwill reporting unit and intangible asset the fair value estimate are based on available historical information and on future expectation we typically estimate the fair value of these asset using the income method which is based on the present value of estimated future cash flow attributable to the respective asset the valuation used to establish and to test goodwill and intangible asset for impairment are dependent on number of significant estimate and assumption including macroeconomic condition overall category growth rate competitive activity cost containment and margin progression company business plan and the discount rate applied to cash flow indefinite lived intangible asset and goodwill are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment our ongoing annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset occurs during the month ended december assumption used in our impairment evaluation such forecasted growth rate and cost of capital are consistent with internal projection and operating plan we believe these estimate and assumption are reasonable and comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participant unanticipated market or macroeconomic event and circumstance may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimate and assumption for example future change in the judgment assumption and estimate that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset including discount and tax rate or future cash flow projection could result in significantly different estimate of the fair value in addition change to or failure to achieve business plan or deterioration of macroeconomic condition could result in reduced cash flow or higher discount rate leading to lower valuation that would trigger an impairment of the goodwill and intangible asset of these business we test individual indefinite lived intangible asset by comparing the book value of each asset to the estimated fair value our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite lived intangible asset if the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible is le than it carrying value that difference represents an impairment determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment certain brand intangible asset are expected to have indefinite life based on their history and our plan to continue to support and build the acquired brand other acquired intangible asset certain brand all customer relationship patent and technology are expected to have determinable useful life our assessment to brand that have an indefinite life and those that have determinable life is based on number of factor including competitive environment market share brand history underlying product life cycle operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the country in which the brand are sold determinable lived intangible asset are amortized to expense over their estimated life an impairment assessment for determinable lived intangible is only required when an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable most of our goodwill reporting unit are comprised of combination of legacy and acquired business and result have fair value cushion that at minimum exceed two time their underlying carrying value certain of our goodwill reporting unit in particular shave care and appliance are comprised entirely of acquired business and result have fair value cushion that are not high our legacy business the appliance reporting unit ha fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value during fiscal non cash before and after tax impairment charge of billion wa recognized to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill for the shave care reporting unit and non cash before tax impairment charge the procter gamble companyof billion billion after tax wa recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset to it fair value the underlying reduction in fair value were due in large part to significant currency devaluation in number of country relative to the dollar deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habit primarily in the developed market and an increased competitive market environment in the and certain other market result of the fiscal impairment determined by the step two testing that existed under previous accounting standard the shave care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately of june because the impairment testing for intangible asset ha historically been one step process the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset fair value approximated it carrying value at that date during our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended december we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on development in the macroeconomic environment result of this change and update to other underlying cash flow projection the shave care fair value exceeded it carrying value by more than and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset fair value exceeded it carrying value by approximately the covid pandemic that originated during the second half of fiscal resulted in reduction in shave incident by consumer and weakening of certain currency relative to the dollar which led to reduction in net sale for gillette branded product this resulted in triggering event for the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset which caused to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset of june that assessment indicated that the fair value of the gillette trade name approximated it carrying value accordingly no impairment charge wa recorded during the year ended june based on our annual impairment testing during the three month ended december the shave care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed it carrying value by more than and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset fair value continued to approximate it carrying value the most significant assumption utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset are the net sale and earnings growth rate including residual growth rate and discount rate the residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter term business planning period the residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimate is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plan and approximates expected long term category market growth rate the residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rate the competitive environment inflation relative currency exchange rate and business activity that impact market share result the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by sustained deceleration in category growth grooming habit change devaluation of currency against the dollar or an increased competitive environment the discount rate which is consistent with weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participant is based upon industry required rate of return including consideration of both debt and equity component of the capital structure our discount rate may be impacted by adverse change in the macroeconomic environment volatility in the equity and debt market or other country specific factor such further devaluation of currency against the dollar spot rate of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimate for cash flow outside the another key assumption in our fair value determination of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is the royalty rate which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying gillette business the royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse change in long term operating margin while management can and ha implemented strategy to address these event in the past change in operating plan or adverse change in the future could reduce the underlying cash flow used to estimate fair value and could result in decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charge of the shave care reporting unit goodwill and indefinite lived intangible the duration and severity of the pandemic could result in additional future impairment charge for the shave care reporting unit goodwill and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset while we have concluded that triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended june the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk our assessment of the gillette intangible asset assumes the net sale growth rate will begin to recover from the impact of the pandemic during the next fiscal year there continues to be high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve how government and consumer will react and progress on the distribution of vaccine accordingly there continues to be risk related to this key assumption more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumption utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment net sale and earnings growth rate could be negatively impacted by more prolonged reduction or change in demand for our shave care product which may be caused by among other thing the temporary inability of consumer to purchase our product due to illness quarantine or other travel restriction financial hardship change in the use and frequency of grooming product or by shift in demand away from one or more of our higher priced product to lower priced product in addition relative global and country regional macroeconomic factor could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other country currency relative to the dollar finally the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by change in the underlying interest rate and risk premium included in the determination of the cost of the procter gamble company of june the carrying value of the shave care goodwill and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset were billion and billion respectively we performed sensitivity analysis for the shave care reporting unit and the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing utilizing reasonably possible change in the assumption for the shorter term and residual growth rate the discount rate and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impact to the estimated fair value the table below provides in isolation the estimated fair value impact related to basis point increase in the discount rate basis point decrease in our shorter term and residual growth rate or basis point decrease in our royalty rate any of which in isolation would result in an impairment of the gillette indefinite lived intangible asset approximate

product offering we are exposed to market risk such change in interest rate currency exchange rate and commodity price we evaluate exposure on centralized basis to take advantage of natural exposure correlation and netting we leverage the company diversified portfolio of exposure natural hedge and prioritize operational hedging activity over financial market instrument to the extent we choose to further manage volatility within our financing operation discussed below we enter into various financial transaction which we account for using the applicable accounting guidance for derivative instrument and hedging activity these financial transaction are governed by our policy covering acceptable counterparty exposure instrument type and other hedging practice see note to the consolidated

the model incorporates the impact of correlation the degree to which exposure move together over time and diversification from holding multiple currency commodity and interest rate instrument and assumes that financial return are normally distributed estimate of volatility and correlation of market factor are drawn from the riskmetrics dataset of june in case where data is unavailable in

period in addition we are not aware of any fact or circumstance that would significantly impact such exposure in the near term interest rate exposure on financial instrument interest rate swap are used to hedge exposure to interest rate movement on underlying debt obligation certain interest rate swap denominated in foreign currency are designated to hedge exposure to currency exchange rate movement on our investment in foreign operation these currency interest rate swap are designated hedge of the company foreign net investment based on our interest rate exposure of and during the year ended june including derivative and other instrument sensitive to interest rate we believe near term change in interest rate at confidence level based on historical interest rate movement would not materially affect our financial statement currency rate exposure on financial instrument because we manufacture and sell product and finance operation in number of country throughout the world we are exposed to the impact on revenue and expense of movement in currency exchange rate corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity to manage the exchange rate risk associated with the financing of our operation we primarily use forward contract and currency swap with maturity of le than month based on our currency rate exposure on derivative and other instrument of and during the year ended june we believe at confidence level based on historical currency rate movement the impact on such instrument of near term change in currency rate would not materially affect our financial statement commodity price exposure on financial instrument we use raw material that are subject to price volatility caused by weather supply condition political and economic variable and other unpredictable factor we may use future option and swap contract to manage the volatility related to the above exposure of and during the year ended june and june we did not have any financial

investment and certain short term debt are recorded at cost which approximates fair value the fair value of long term debt and financial instrument are disclosed in note new accounting pronouncement and policieson july we adopted asu intangible goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment the standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring goodwill impairment to be measured using single step impairment model whereby the impairment equal the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting unit in their entirety this eliminated the second step of the previous impairment model that required company to first estimate the fair value of all asset in reporting unit and measure impairment based on those estimated fair value and residual measurement approach it also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the impact of the new standard will depend on the specific fact and circumstance of future individual impairment if any in march the fasb issued asu reference rate reform topic facilitation of the effect of reference rate reform on financial reporting the amendment provide optional guidance for limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform the new guidance provides

goodwill and indefinite lived intangible are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting unit and underlying indefinite lived intangible asset to their respective carrying value we typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these asset which is based on forecast of the expected future cash flow attributable to the respective asset significant estimate and assumption inherent in the valuation reflect consideration of other marketplace participant and include the amount and timing of future cash flow including expected growth rate and profitability estimate utilized in the projected cash flow include consideration of macroeconomic condition overall category growth rate competitive activity cost containment and

unanticipated market or macroeconomic event and circumstance may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimate and assumption we believe the estimate and assumption utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participant however actual event and result could differ substantially from those used in our valuation to the extent such factor result in failure to achieve the level of projected cash flow initially used to estimate fair value for purpose of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible asset we may need to record additional non cash impairment charge in the future goodwill increased during fiscal driven by minor brand acquisition in
