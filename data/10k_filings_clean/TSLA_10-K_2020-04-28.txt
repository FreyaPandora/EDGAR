medical and dependent care flexible spending account and health saving account chief executive officer compensation overview historically in developing compensation recommendation for our chief executive officer the compensation committee ha sought both to appropriately reward our chief executive officer previous and current contribution and to create incentive for our chief executive officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful result in the future each of the ceo performance award and the performance based stock option award granted to our chief executive officer in august the ceo performance award is focused on this latter objective it solely reward future performance in addition to serving our chief executive officer since october elon musk ha contributed significantly and actively to since our earliest day in april by recruiting executive and engineer contributing to vehicle engineering and design raising capital for and bringing investor to and raising public awareness of tesla cash compensation mr musk historically earned base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirement under california law and he wa subject to income tax based on such base salary however he ha never accepted his salary commencing in may at mr musk request we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary historical equity compensation prior to stock option award made in december mr musk did not receive any equity compensation for his service for period of five year in and mr musk did not receive any equity grant because the compensation committee believed his existing grant made in december already provided sufficient motivation for mr musk to perform his duty chief executive officer in august to create incentive for continued long term success from the recently launched model program well from tesla then planned model and model program and to further align executive compensation with increase in stockholder value the board granted to mr musk the ceo performance award comprised of stock option award to purchase share of tesla common stock representing of tesla total issued and outstanding share at the time of grant the ceo performance award consists of equal vesting tranche each requiring that tesla meet combination of the achievement of specified operational milestone relating to development of model or model aggregate vehicle production or gross margin target and ii sustained incremental billion increase in tesla market capitalization from billion tesla market capitalization at the time of grant the market capitalization condition for all of the vesting tranche and of the operational milestone have been achieved and therefore of tranche under the ceo performance award have vested of the date of this filing only one operational milestone requiring gross margin of or more for four consecutive quarter ha not been achieved and remains outstanding prior to the only additional equity award received by mr musk related to certain immaterial award granted during pursuant to patent incentive program that wa available to our employee generally ceo performance award early in with the ceo performance award heading to substantial completion after helped tesla grow it market capitalization to over billion in over five year the independent member of the board began preliminary discussion regarding how to continue to incentivize mr musk to lead tesla through the next phase of it development in january following more than six month of careful analysis and development led by the compensation committee with participation by every independent board member the help of compensia national compensation consulting firm and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional stockholder the board granted the ceo performance award to mr musk such grant wa subject to approval by majority of the total vote of tesla common stock not owned by mr musk or kimbal musk cast at meeting of the stockholder to approve the ceo performance award on march such approval wa obtained with approximately of the vote cast by such disinterested share voting in favor of the ceo performance award the ceo performance award is comprised of year maximum term stock option to purchase share of tesla common stock divided equally among separate tranche that are each equivalent to of the issued and outstanding share of tesla common stock at the time of grant at an exercise price of per share each of the vesting tranche of the ceo performance award will vest upon certification by the board that both the market capitalization milestone for such tranche which begin at billion for the first tranche and increase by increment of billion thereafter and ii any one of the following operational milestone focused on revenue or operational milestone focused on profitability ha been met total revenue in billion adjusted ebitda in billion revenue mean total revenue reported in tesla financial statement on form or filed with the sec for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarter adjusted ebitda mean net income loss attributable to common stockholder ii interest expense iii benefit provision for income tax iv depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation each such item is reported in tesla financial statement on form or filed with the sec for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarter any single operational milestone may only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone subject to any applicable clawback provision policy or other forfeiture term once milestone is achieved it is forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of tranche meeting more than of the operational milestone will not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to mr musk under the ceo performance award except in change in control situation measurement of the market capitalization milestone will be based on both six calendar month trailing average of tesla stock price well ii calendar day trailing average of tesla stock price in each case based on trading day only upon the consummation of certain acquisition or split spin off or divestiture transaction each then unachieved market capitalization milestone and or operational milestone will be adjusted to offset the impact of such transaction to the extent they could be considered material to the achievement of those milestone in establishing the revenue and adjusted ebitda milestone the board carefully considered variety of factor including tesla growth trajectory and internal growth plan and the historical performance of other high growth and high multiple company in the technology space that have invested in new business and tangible asset these benchmark provided revenue ebitda to market capitalization multiple which were then used to inform the specific operational target that aligned with tesla plan for future growth nevertheless the board considers each of the market capitalization and operational milestone to be challenging hurdle for example in order to meet all market capitalization milestone tesla will have to add approximately billion to it market capitalization at the time of the grant of the ceo performance award and in order to satisfy all eight revenue based operational milestone tesla would have to increase revenue by more than billion from it annual revenue of approximately billion in the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the ceo performance award in addition mr musk must continue to lead tesla our chief executive officer or alternatively our chief product officer and executive chairman with any other chief executive officer reporting directly to him at the time each milestone is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest with limited exception mr musk must hold any share that he acquires upon exercise of the ceo performance award for at least five year post exercise there will be no acceleration of vesting of the ceo performance award upon mr musk termination death or disability or change in control of tesla however in change in control situation the achievement of the milestone will be based solely on the market capitalization milestone with the measurement of tesla market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding share of tesla common stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of share of tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price plus the per share value of any other consideration received by tesla stockholder in the change in control in the event of restatement of tesla financial statement previously filed with the sec if lesser portion of the ceo performance award would have vested based on the restated financial result then tesla will require forfeiture or repayment applicable of the portion of the ceo performance award that would not have vested based on the restated financial result le any amount mr musk may have paid to tesla in exercising any forfeited award the ceo performance award also will be subject if more stringent than the foregoing to any current or future tesla clawback policy applicable to equity award provided that the policy doe not discriminate solely mr musk except required by applicable law of the date of this filing two operational milestone relating to billion total revenue and ii billion adjusted ebitda have been achieved subject to formal certification by the board and no market capitalization milestone ha been achieved consequently no share subject to the ceo performance award have vested of the date of this filing however if the value of tesla closing stock price continues near the level seen in late april the first market capitalization milestone of billion is expected to be met during the second quarter of in such event upon certification by our board of director the first tranche under the ceo performance award would vest and become exercisable subject to mr musk payment of the exercise price of per share and the minimum five year holding period generally applicable to any share he acquires upon exercise realized compensation for purpose of the table in summary compensation table under this item below we are required to report pursuant to applicable sec rule any stock option grant to mr musk at value determined of their respective grant date and which are driven by certain assumption prescribed by financial accounting board accounting standard codification topic compensation stock compensation asc topic moreover we are required to report in pay ratio disclosure under this item below mr musk annual total compensation ii the median of the annual total compensation of all tesla employee qualifying for this analysis other than mr musk in each case calculated pursuant to the methodology used for the table under summary compensation table and iii the ratio of the former to the latter in addition we are required to report in option exercise and stock vested under this item below an amount for the value realized upon any exercise by mr musk of stock option which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying share at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option and ii any vesting of restricted stock unit award based on the market price of the award at the time of vesting such amount is required to be reported even if mr musk doe not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting either because he doe not also sell any share or because he sell only number of share sufficient to cover the related tax liability resulting from the exercise or vesting result there may be significant disconnect between is reported compensation for mr musk in given year in such section and the value actually realized compensation in that year or over period of time moreover the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grant to mr musk including the ceo performance award and the ceo performance award were incentive for future performance and their value is realizable only if tesla stock price appreciates compared to the date of the grant and if the company achieves applicable vesting requirement to supplement the disclosure in summary compensation table pay ratio disclosure and option exercise and stock vested under this item below we have included the following table which show the total realized compensation of mr musk for the last three fiscal year well the ratio of mr musk realized compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all other tesla employee qualifying for this analysis reported under pay ratio disclosure realized compensation is not substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure but we believe that realized compensation is an important factor in understanding that the value of compensation that mr musk ultimately realizes is dependent on number of additional factor including the vesting of certain of his option award only upon the successful achievement of number of market capitalization increase and operational milestone target including milestone that have not yet been achieved under each of the ceo performance award and the ceo performance award ii the fact that mr musk doe not receive any cash if he doe not actually sell share and thereby reduce his investment in and he doe not receive any cash to the extent that he sell only share sufficient to cover income tax with respect to his award including stock option exercised solely to avoid their expiration in accordance with their term and iii the then current market value of our common stock at the time at which mr musk may elect to actually sell his share year total compensation of ceo reported in summary compensation table below value realized on exercise or vesting of award of ceo reported in option exercise and stock vested table below median annual total compensation of all qualifying non

incentive plan compensation and all other compensation plus ii with respect to any stock option exercised by mr musk in such year in connection with which share of stock were also sold other than to satisfy any resulting tax liability the difference between the market price of such share at the time of exercise and the applicable exercise price of the option plus iii with respect to any restricted stock unit vested by mr musk in such year in connection with which share of stock were also sold other than automatic sale to satisfy any withholding obligation related to such vesting the market price of such share at the time of vesting plus iv any cash actually received by mr musk in respect of any share sold to cover tax liability described in ii and iii above following the payment of such tax liability of the amount noted mr musk ha not accepted his salary in the amount of and for and respectively reflects the applicable minimum wage requirement under california law for part of commencing in may at mr musk request we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary reflects the exercise of vested stock option award to which mr musk paid the exercise price in cash none of the share received upon exercise have been sold and therefore this amount ha not been received by mr musk includes attributed to the ceo performance award which is intended to compensate mr musk over it year maximum term and will become vested to all share subject to it only if our market capitalization increase to billion and of total operational milestone are achieved during such year period each tranche of of the total number of share subject to the option will become vested and exercisable each time our market capitalization increase initially to billion for the first tranche and by an additional billion for each tranche thereafter and ii one of specified operational milestone relating to total revenue or adjusted ebitda other than an operating milestone that previously counted towards the vesting of another tranche is attained subject to mr musk continued service to either ceo or both executive chairman and chief product officer with the ceo reporting to him at each such vesting event this award wa designed to be entirely an incentive for future performance that would take many year if at all to be achieved further each of the requirement underlying the performance milestone wa selected to be difficult to achieve if any option have not vested by the end of the term of the option award they will be forfeited and mr musk will not realize the value of such option of the date of this filing zero market capitalization milestone have been achieved and two operational milestone have been achieved subject to board certification and consequently no share have vested under the ceo performance award following vesting the actual receipt of any share by mr musk will further be subject to his payment of the exercise price of per share see
