subject to revenue split with the content provider our programming cost have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increase we expect programming cost to continue to increase due to variety of factor including annual increase pursuant to our programming contract contract renewal with programmer and the carriage of incremental programming including new service and vod programming increase in the cost of sport programming and the amount paid for broadcast station retransmission consent have been the largest contributor to the growth in our programming cost over the last year additionally the demand of large medium company who link carriage of their most popular network to carriage and cost increase of their le popular network ha limited our flexibility in creating more tailored and cost sensitive programming package for consumer federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for retransmission consent we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission continuing demand by owner of broadcast station for cash payment at substantial increase over amount paid in prior year in exchange for retransmission consent will increase our programming cost or require to cease carriage of popular programming potentially leading to loss of customer in affected service area over the past several year increase in our video service rate have not fully offset the increase in our programming cost and with the impact of increasing competition and other marketplace factor we do not expect the increase in our video service rate to fully offset the increase in our programming cost for the foreseeable future although we pas along portion of amount paid for retransmission consent to the majority of our customer our inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our video customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated our video product in order to mitigate reduction of our operating margin due to rapidly increasing programming cost we continue to review our pricing and programming packaging strategy our programming contract are generally for fixed period of time usually for multiple year and are

service in the future including verizon which currently offer fixed wireless service in small portion of our footprint and at which ha also announced it plan to launch service some mobile phone company offer unlimited data package to customer in addition growing number of commercial area such retail mall restaurant and airport offer wifi internet service numerous local government are also considering or actively pursuing publicly subsidized wifi internet access network these option offer alternative to cable based internet access voice competitionour residential voice service competes with wireless and wireline phone provider well other form of communication such text messaging on cellular phone instant messaging social networking service video conferencing and email we also compete with over the top phone provider such vonage skype magicjack google voice and ooma inc well company that sell phone card at cost per minute for both national and international service the increase in the number of different technology capable of carrying voice service and the number of alternative communication option available to customer well the replacement of wireline service by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our residential voice service our mobile service competes with other mobile provider such verizon at mobile inc mobile and sprint corporation sprint in april sprint and mobile announced their intent to merge if approved the resulting company would be one of nation largest mobile carrier bringing increased competition with stated intent of pursuing broad network deployment regional competitorsin some of our operating area other competitor have built network that offer video internet and voice service that compete with our service for example in certain service area our residential video internet and voice service compete with google fiber cincinnati bell inc hawaiian telcom owned by cincinnati bell inc rcn telecom service llc grande communication network llc and wideopenwest finance llc additional competitionin addition to multi channel video provider cable system compete with other source of news information and entertainment including over the air television broadcast reception live event movie theater and the internet competition is also posed by fixed wireless and satellite master antenna television system or smatv system serving mdus such condominium apartment complex and private residential community business serviceswe face intense competition across each of our business service product offering our small and medium business video internet networking and voice service face competition from variety of provider described our enterprise solution also face from the competitor described above well other telecommunication carrier such metro and regional fiber based carrier we also compete with cloud hosting and related service provider and application service provider advertisingwe face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platform and from wide range of local and national competitor advertising competition ha increased and will likely continue to increase new advertising avenue seek to attract the same advertiser we compete for advertising revenue against among others local broadcast station national cable and broadcast network radio station print medium and online advertising company and content provider seasonality and cyclicality our business is subject to seasonal and cyclical variation our result are impacted by the seasonal nature of customer receiving our cable service in college and vacation service area our revenue is subject to cyclical advertising pattern and change in viewership level our advertising revenue is generally higher in the second and fourth calendar quarter of each year due in part to increase in consumer advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season advertising revenue is also cyclical benefiting in even numbered year from advertising related to candidate running for political office and issue oriented advertising our capital expenditure and trade working capital are also subject to significant seasonality based on the timing of subscriber growth network program specific project and construction regulation and legislation the following summary address the key regulatory and legislative development affecting the cable industry and our service for both residential and commercial customer cable system operation are extensively regulated by the federal government primarily the fcc certain state government and many local government failure to comply with these regulation could subject to substantial penalty our business can be dramatically impacted by change to the existing regulatory framework whether triggered by legislative administrative or judicial ruling congress and the fcc have frequently revisited the subject of communication regulation and they are likely to do in the future we could be materially disadvantaged in the future if we are subject to new law regulation or regulatory action that do not equally impact our key competitor we can not provide assurance that the already extensive regulation of our business will not be expanded in the future in addition we are already subject to charter specific condition regarding certain business practice result of the fcc approval of the transaction video servicemust carry retransmission consentthere are two alternative legal method for carriage of local broadcast television station on cable system federal must carry regulation require cable system to carry local broadcast television station upon the request of the local broadcaster alternatively federal law includes retransmission consent regulation by which popular commercial television station can prohibit cable carriage unless the cable operator first negotiates for retransmission consent which may be conditioned on significant payment or other concession popular station invoking retransmission consent have been demanding substantial compensation increase in their recent negotiation with cable operator thereby significantly increasing our operating cost additional government mandated broadcast carriage obligation including those related to the fcc newly adopted enhanced technical broadcasting option advanced television system committee could disrupt existing programming commitment interfere with our preferred use of limited channel capacity and limit our ability to offer service that appeal to our customer and generate revenue cable equipmentin congress enacted statute requiring the fcc to adopt regulation designed to assure the development of an independent retail market for navigation device such cable set top box result the fcc required cable operator to make separate offering of security module cablecard that can be used with retail navigation device companion rule that effectively required to use cablecards in our own new set top box wa repealed by congress in but the basic obligation to provide separable security for retail device remains in place various party may continue to advocate new regulatory approach to reduce consumer dependency on traditional operator provided set top box that if adopted could affect our business in the future and information security regulationthe communication act of amended the communication act limit our ability to collect use and disclose customer personally identifiable information for our video voice and internet service we are subject to additional federal state and local law and regulation that impose additional restriction on the collection use and disclosure of consumer information further the fcc federal trade commission ftc and many state regulate and restrict the marketing practice of communication service provider including telemarketing and sending unsolicited commercial email result of the fcc decision reclassifying broadband internet access service an information service the ftc again ha the authority pursuant to it general authority to enforce against unfair or deceptive act and practice to protect the privacy of internet service customer including our use and disclosure of certain customer information our operation are also subject to federal and state law governing information security in the event of an information security breach such rule may require consumer and government agency notification and may result in regulatory enforcement action with the potential of monetary forfeiture the fcc the ftc and state attorney general regularly bring enforcement action against company related to information security breach and privacy violation various security standard provide guidance to telecommunication company in order to help identify and mitigate cybersecurity risk one such standard is the voluntary framework released by the national institute for standard and technology nist in and updated in in cooperation with other federal agency and owner and operator of critical infrastructure the nist cybersecurity framework provides prioritized and flexible model for organization to identify and manage cyber risk inherent to their business it wa designed to supplement not supersede existing cybersecurity regulation and requirement several government agency have encouraged compliance with the nist cybersecurity framework including the fcc which is also considering expansion of it cybersecurity guideline or the adoption of cybersecurity requirement after the repeal of the fcc privacy rule through the congressional review act and despite language in the fcc decision reclassifying broadband internet access service an information service and preempting state and local privacy regulation conflicting with federal policy many state and local authority have considered legislative or other action that would impose additional restriction on our ability to collect use and disclose certain information california for example enacted in complex law in june which under certain circumstance will regulate company use and disclosure of the personal information of california resident and authorizes enforcement action by the california attorney general and private class action the california consumer privacy act is subject to amendment by the california legislature and further regulatory clarification by the california attorney general before it go into effect in january we expect state and local effort to regulate online privacy to continue in additionally several state legislature are considering the adoption of new data security and cybersecurity legislation that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business there are also bill pending in both the house of representative and senate that could impose new privacy and data security obligation we can not predict whether any of these effort will be successful or preempted or how new legislation and regulation if any would affect our business pole attachmentsthe communication act requires most utility owning utility pole to provide cable system with access to pole and conduit and simultaneously subject the rate charged for this access to either federal or state regulation after fcc regulatory amendment and litigation challenging those amendment the federally regulated rate now applicable to pole attachment used for cable internet and telecommunication service are substantially similar the fcc regulatory amendment do not directly affect the rate in state that self regulate but many of those state have substantially the same rate for all communication attachment some municipality have enacted one touch make ready pole attachment ordinance which permit third party to alter component of our network attached to utility pole in way that could adversely affect our business some of these ordinance have been challenged with differing result in the fcc adopted one touch make ready otmr rule that will apply in state pole attachment are fcc regulated and they may impact many of our existing pole attachment various utility have sought review of the otmr rule in federal court cable rate regulationfederal law strictly limit the potential scope of cable rate regulation pursuant to federal law all video offering are universally exempt from rate regulation except for cable system minimum level of video programming service referred to basic service and associated equipment rate regulation of basic service and associated equipment operates pursuant to federal formula with local government commonly referred to local franchising authority primarily responsible for administering regulation fcc regulation require local franchise authority interested in regulating cable rate to first make an affirmative showing that there is no effective competition defined under federal law in the community few local franchise authority have filed the necessary rate regulation certification and we have petition pending at the fcc challenging the remaining certification the fcc is also considering possible reform to any remaining rate regulation access channelslocal franchise agreement often require cable operator to set aside certain channel for public educational and governmental access programming federal law also requires cable system to designate up to of their channel capacity for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third party who may offer programming that our customer do not particularly desire although commercial leased access activity historically ha been relatively limited the fcc is currently considering change to it leased access regulation and increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable system other fcc regulatory mattersfcc regulation cover variety of additional area including among other thing ownership restriction equal employment opportunity obligation customer service standard technical service standard mandatory blackout of certain network and syndicated programming restriction on political advertising restriction on advertising in child programming licensing of system and facility maintenance of public file emergency alert system inside wiring and exclusive contract for mdu complex and disability access including requirement governing video description and closed captioning each of these regulation restricts our business practice to varying degree and may impose additional cost on our operation further the fcc regulates spectrum usage and other communication enterprise in way that could impact our operation for example the fcc is currently considering proposal to reallocate for other purpose certain spectrum currently used by cable operator to deliver video programming to individual cable system it is possible that congress or the fcc will expand or modify it regulation of cable system in the future and we can not predict at this time how that might impact our business copyrightcable system are subject to federal compulsory copyright license covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signal the copyright law provides copyright owner the right to audit our payment under the compulsory license and the copyright office is currently considering modification to the license royalty calculation and reporting obligation the possible modification or elimination of this license is the subject of continuing legislative proposal and administrative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming copyright clearance for non broadcast programming service are arranged through private negotiation cable operator also must obtain music right for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing right organization these licensing fee have been the source of litigation in the past and we can not predict with certainty whether license fee dispute may arise in the future franchise mattersour cable system generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchise permit and similar authorization granted by municipality or other state or local government entity in order to utilize and cross public right of way cable franchise generally are granted for fixed term and in many case include monetary penalty for noncompliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provision the specific term and condition of cable franchise vary significantly between jurisdiction they generally contain provision governing cable operation franchise fee system construction maintenance technical performance customer service standard supporting and carrying public access channel and change in the ownership of the franchisee although local franchising authority have considerable discretion in establishing franchise term certain federal protection benefit cable operator for example federal law cap local franchise fee number of state have adopted franchising law that provide for statewide franchising some of which subject cable system to the jurisdiction of centralized state government agency such public utility commission generally state wide cable franchise are issued for fixed term but streamline many of the traditional local cable franchise requirement and eliminate local negotiation prior to the scheduled expiration of our franchise we generally initiate renewal proceeding with the granting authority the communication act which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communication provides for an orderly franchise process in which granting authority may not unreasonably withhold renewal in connection with the franchise renewal process however many local governmental authority and some state agency may require the cable operator to make additional costly commitment historically we have been able to renew our franchise without incurring significant cost although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable term or otherwise if we fail to obtain renewal of franchise representing significant number of our customer it could have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or our liquidity similarly if franchising authority consent is required for the purchase or sale of cable system the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirement condition for providing it consent in july the new york state public service commission revoked it earlier approval of charter acquisition of legacy twc alleging that charter had not complied with it transaction commitment to extend availability of high speed internet service to underserved or unserved home or business over four year period charter is vigorously opposing the public service commission revocation which if not reversed could materially impact our operation in new york state see item legal proceeding the traditional cable franchising regime ha undergone significant change in recent year result of various federal and state action and the fcc continues to address cable franchising issue internet servicein the fcc determined that broadband internet access service such those we offer were telecommunication service under the communication act and on that basis imposed number of net neutrality rule governing the provision of broadband service including transparency requirement an obligation to disclose all material term and condition of our service to consumer in december the fcc adopted new order reclassifying broadband an information service and eliminating the rule other than the transparency requirement which it eased in significant way the fcc also ruled that state regulator may not impose obligation similar to federal obligation that the fcc removed various party have challenged the fcc december ruling seeking court order to reinstate the fcc rule at the same time several state including california have adopted state obligation replacing the internet access obligation that the fcc removed california legislation ha been challenged in court and we can not predict how any such legislation and court challenge will be resolved moreover irrespective of these case it is possible that the fcc might further revise it approach to broadband internet access in the future or that congress might enact legislation affecting the rule applicable to the service notwithstanding the reclassification of internet access service an information service broadband provider remain obliged by the communication assistance for law enforcement act calea to configure their network in manner that facilitates the ability of law enforcement with proper legal authorization to obtain information about our customer including the content of their internet communication it is also possible that internet access service will be subjected to universal service funding requirement these funding requirement could impose significant new cost on our internet service the fcc and some state regulatory commission direct certain subsidy to telephone company deploying broadband to area deemed to be unserved or underserved we have opposed such subsidy when directed to area that we serve despite our effort future subsidy may be directed to area served by which could result in subsidized competitor operating in our service territory state and local governmental organization have also adopted internet related regulation these various governmental jurisdiction are also considering additional regulation in these and other area such privacy pricing service and product quality imposition of local franchise fee on internet related revenue and taxation the adoption of new internet regulation or the adaptation of existing law to the internet including potential responsibility for the infringing activites of internet subscriber could adversely affect our business aside from the fcc generally applicable regulation we have made certain commitment to comply with the fcc order in connection with the fcc approval of the twc transaction and the bright house transaction discussed below voice servicethe telecommunication act of created more favorable regulatory environment for to provide telecommunication and or competitive voice service than had previously existed in particular it established requirement ensuring that competitive telephone company could interconnect their network with those provider of traditional telecommunication service to open the market to competition the fcc ha subsequently ruled that competitive telephone company that support voip service such those we offer our customer are entitled to interconnection with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service which ensures that our voip service can compete in the market since that time the fcc ha initiated proceeding to determine whether such interconnection right should extend to traditional and competitive network utilizing ip technology and to encourage the transition to ip network throughout the industry the fcc initiated further proceeding in to consider whether additional change to interconnection obligation are needed including how and where company interconnect their network with the network of other provider new rule or obligation arising from these proceeding may affect our ability to compete in the provision of voice service further regulatory change are being considered that could impact our voice business and that of our primary telecommunication competitor the fcc and state regulatory authority are considering for example whether certain common carrier regulation traditionally applied to incumbent local exchange carrier should be modified or reduced and in some jurisdiction the extent to which common carrier requirement should be extended to voip provider the fcc ha already determined that certain provider of voice service using internet protocol technology like our voip service must comply with requirement relating to emergency service the calea the statute governing law enforcement access to and surveillance of communication universal service fund contribution customer privacy and customer proprietary network information issue number portability network outage reporting rural call completion disability access regulatory fee back up power obligation and discontinuance of service in federal appeal court affirmed the fcc decision concerning federal regulation of certain voip service but declined to specifically find that voip service provided by cable company such we provide should be regulated only at the federal level result some state have begun proceeding to subject cable voip service to state level regulation and at least one state ha asserted jurisdiction over our voip service we prevailed on legal challenge to that state assertion of jurisdiction although we have registered with or obtained certificate or authorization from the fcc and the state regulatory authority in those state in which we offer competitive voice service in order to ensure the continuity of our service and to maintain needed network interconnection arrangement it is unclear whether and how these and other ongoing regulatory matter ultimately will be resolved mobile service we recently launched our spectrum mobile service to residential customer under current arrangement we provision this service an mvno which allows to deliver service over verizon network and our network of spectrum wifi hotspot an mvno we are subject to many of the same fcc regulation that apply to facility based wireless carrier well certain state or local regulation including but not limited to local number portability customer privacy calea universal service fund hearing aid compatibility and other requirement well safety and emission standard applicable to mobile device to the extent spectrum mobile provides broadband internet access it must comply with the fcc transparency rule the fcc or other regulatory authority may adopt new or different regulation for mvnos and or mobile broadband provider in the future or impose new tax or fee applicable to spectrum mobile which could adversely affect the service offering or our business generally transaction related commitment in connection with approval of the transaction federal and state regulator imposed number of post merger condition on including but not limited to the following fcc condition offer settlement free internet interconnection to any party that meet the requirement of our interconnection policy available on charter website on term generally consistent with the policy for seven year with possible reduction to five deploy and offer high speed broadband internet access service to an additional two million location over five year refrain from charging usage based price or imposing data cap on any fixed mass market broadband internet access service plan for seven year with possible reduction to five offer mbps discounted broadband where technically feasible to eligible customer throughout our service area for four year from the offer commencement and continue to provide cablecards to any new or existing customer upon request for use in third party retail device for four year and continue to support such cablecards for seven year in each case unless the fcc change the relevant rule the fcc condition also contain number of compliance reporting requirement doj conditionsthe department of justice doj order prohibits from entering into or enforcing any agreement with video programmer that forbids limit or creates incentive to limit the video programmer provision of content to online video distributor ovds we will not be able to avail ourself of other distributor most favored nation mfn provision if they are inconsistent with prohibition the doj condition are effective for seven year although we may petition the doj to eliminate the condition after five year state conditionscertain state regulator including california new york hawaii and new jersey also imposed condition in connection with the approval of the transaction these condition include requirement related to upgrading network within the designated state including upgrade to broadband speed and conversion of all household served within california and new york to an all digital platform building out our network to certain household and business location that are not currently served by cable within the designated state offering lifeline service discount and low income broadband to eligible household served within the applicable state investing in service improvement program and customer service enhancement and maintaining customer facing job within the designated state continuing to make legacy service offering available including allowing legacy twc and legacy bright house customer to maintain their existing service offering for period of three year and complying with reporting requirement employee of december we had approximately active full time equivalent employee item risk factor risk related to our businesswe operate in very competitive business environment which affect our ability to attract and retain customer and can adversely affect our business operation and financial result the industry in which we operate is highly competitive and ha become more so in recent year in some instance we compete against company with fewer regulatory burden better access to financing greater personnel resource greater resource for marketing greater and more favorable brand name recognition and long established relationship with regulatory authority and customer increasing consolidation in the telecommunication and content industry have provided additional benefit to certain of our competitor either through access to financing resource or efficiency of scale including the ability to launch new video service our video service face competition from number of source including db service well other company that deliver movie television show and other video programming over broadband internet connection to tv computer tablet and mobile device our internet service face competition from the phone company dsl ftth and wireless broadband offering well from variety of company that offer other form of online service including wireless and satellite based broadband service various mobile phone company offer wireless internet service delivered over network which they continue to enhance to deliver faster speed and some have announced that they intend to offer faster service in the future our voice and mobile service compete with mobile and wireline phone provider well other form of communication such text messaging on cellular phone instant messaging social networking service video conferencing and email competition from these company including intensive marketing effort with aggressive pricing exclusive programming and increased hd broadcasting may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and retain customer wireline and wireless overbuilds could also adversely affect our growth financial condition and result of operation by creating or increasing competition we are aware of traditional overbuild situation impacting certain of our service area however we are unable to predict the extent to which additional overbuild situation may occur our service may not allow to compete effectively competition may reduce our expected growth of future cash flow which may contribute to future impairment of our franchise and goodwill and our ability to meet cash flow requirement including debt service requirement for additional information regarding the competition we face see item business competition and regulation and legislation we are not able to successfully complete the integration of our business with that of legacy twc and legacy bright house the anticipated benefit of the transaction may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected in such circumstance we may not perform expected and the value of charter class common stock may be adversely affected there can be no assurance that we can successfully complete the integration of our business with that of legacy twc and legacy bright house we now have significantly more system asset investment business customer and employee than each company prior to the transaction it is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of customer the disruption of our ongoing business or in unexpected integration issue higher than expected integration cost and an overall post completion integration process that take longer than originally anticipated the process of integrating legacy twc and legacy bright house with the legacy charter operation requires significant capital expenditure and the expansion of certain operation and operating and financial system management continues to devote significant amount of time and attention to the integration process and there is significant degree of difficulty and management involvement inherent in that process even if the new business are successfully integrated it may not be possible to realize the benefit that are expected to result from the transaction or realize these benefit within the time frame that is expected for example the benefit of our pricing and packaging and converting our video product to all digital in certain legacy twc and legacy bright house system may not be fully realized or may take longer than anticipated to realize or the benefit from the transaction may be offset by cost incurred or delay in integrating the business and increased operating cost if the combined company fails to realize the anticipated benefit from the transaction our liquidity result of operation financial condition and or share price may be adversely affected in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management and resource may be focused on the integration of the business and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt the business of the combined company we face risk relating to competition for the leisure time and discretionary spending of audience which ha intensified in part due to advance in technology and change in consumer expectation and behavior in addition to the various competitive factor discussed above we are subject to risk relating to increasing competition for the leisure time shifting consumer need and discretionary spending of consumer we compete with all other source of entertainment news and information delivery well broad range of communication product and service technological advancement such new video format and internet streaming and downloading of programming that can be viewed on television computer smartphones and tablet many of which have been beneficial to have nonetheless increased the number of entertainment and information delivery choice available to consumer and intensified the challenge posed by audience fragmentation these newer category of competitor including mvpds and other new direct to consumer offering well piracy and password sharing could negatively impact the growth of our business newer product and service particularly alternative method for the distribution sale and viewing of content will likely continue to be developed further increasing the number of competitor that we face the increasing number of choice available to audience including low cost or free choice could negatively impact not only consumer demand for our product and service but also advertiser willingness to purchase advertising from we compete for the sale of advertising revenue with television network and station well other advertising platform such radio print and increasingly online medium our failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to new technology and change in consumer expectation and behavior could significantly adversely affect our competitive position and our business and result of operation our exposure to the economic condition of our current and potential customer vendor and third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we are exposed to risk associated with the economic condition of our current and potential customer the potential financial instability of our customer and their financial ability to purchase our product if there were general economic downturn we may experience increased cancellation by our customer or unfavorable change in the mix of product purchased including an increase in the number of home that replace their video service with internet delivered and or over air content which would negatively impact our ability to attract customer increase rate and maintain or increase revenue in addition providing video service is an established and highly penetrated business our ability to gain new video subscriber is dependent to large extent on growth in occupied housing in our service area which is influenced by both national and local economic condition weak economic condition may also have negative impact on our advertising revenue these event have adversely affected in the past and may adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition if downturn were to occur in addition we are susceptible to risk associated with the potential financial instability of the vendor and third party on which we rely to provide product and service or to which we outsource certain function the same economic condition that may affect our customer well volatility and disruption in the capital and credit market also could adversely affect vendor and third party and lead to significant increase in price reduction in output or the bankruptcy of our vendor or third party upon we rely any interruption in the service provided by our vendor or by third party could adversely affect our cash flow result of operation and financial condition we face risk inherent in our commercial business we may encounter unforeseen difficulty we increase the scale of our service offering to business we sell internet access data networking and fiber connectivity to cellular tower and office building and video and business voice service to business in order to grow our commercial business we expect to continue to invest in technology equipment and personnel focused on the commercial business commercial business customer often require service level agreement and generally have heightened customer expectation for reliability of service if our effort to build the infrastructure to scale the commercial business are not successful the growth of our commercial service business would be limited we depend on interconnection and related service provided by certain third party for the growth of our commercial business result our ability to implement change the service grow may be limited if we are unable to meet these service level requirement or expectation our commercial business could be adversely affected competition continues to increase well more company deploy more fiber to more building which may negatively impact our growth and or put pressure on margin finally we expect advance in communication technology well change in the marketplace and the regulatory and legislative environment consequently we are unable to predict the effect that ongoing or future development in these area might have on our voice and commercial business and operation programming cost are rising at much faster rate than wage or inflation and we may not have the ability to reduce or moderate the growth rate of or pas on to our customer our increasing programming cost which would adversely affect our cash flow and operating margin video programming ha been and is expected to continue to be our largest operating expense item in recent year the cable industry ha experienced rapid escalation in the cost of programming medium corporation consolidation ha resulted in fewer supplier and additional selling power on the part of programming supplier we expect programming cost to continue to increase due to variety of factor including amount paid for broadcast station retransmission consent annual increase imposed by programmer including sport programmer and the carriage of incremental programming including new service and vod programming the inability to fully pas programming cost increase on to our customer ha had and is expected in the future to have an adverse impact on our cash flow and operating margin associated with the video product the contract set to expire in any particular year vary with higher concentration of programming cost set to expire at or before the end of there can be no assurance that these agreement will be renewed on favorable or comparable term in addition number of programmer have begun to sell their service through alternative distribution channel including ip based platform which are le secure than our own video distribution platform there is growing evidence that these le secure video distribution platform are leading to video product theft via password sharing among consumer password sharing may drive the number of customer who pay for certain programming putting programmer revenue at risk and which in turn may cause certain programmer to seek even higher programming fee from to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmer on term that we believe are reasonable we have been and may be in the future forced to remove such programming channel from our line up which may result in loss of customer our failure to carry programming that is attractive to our customer could adversely impact our customer level operation and financial result in addition if our internet customer are unable to access desirable content online content provider block or limit access by our customer class our ability to gain and retain customer especially internet customer may be negatively impacted increased demand by owner of some broadcast station for carriage of other service or payment to those broadcaster for retransmission consent are likely to further increase our programming cost federal law allows commercial television broadcast station to make an election between must carry right and an alternative retransmission consent regime when station opts for the retransmission consent regime we are not allowed to carry the station signal without that station permission in some case we carry station under short term arrangement while we attempt to negotiate new long term retransmission agreement if negotiation with these programmer prove unsuccessful they could require to cease carrying their signal possibly for an indefinite period any loss of station could make our video service le attractive to customer which could result in le subscription and advertising revenue in retransmission consent negotiation broadcaster often condition consent with respect to one station on carriage of one or more other station or programming service in which they or their affiliate have an interest carriage of these other service well increased fee for retransmission right may increase our programming expense and diminish the amount of capacity we have available to introduce new service which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result inability to respond to technological development and meet customer demand for new product and service could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively we operate in highly competitive consumer driven and rapidly changing environment from time to time we may pursue strategic initiative including for example our wireless strategy which includes the launch of our mobile product through an mvno and testing the deployment of unlicensed and licensed spectrum for fixed and mobile wireless service our success is to large extent dependent on our ability to acquire develop adopt upgrade and exploit new and existing technology to address consumer changing demand and distinguish our service from those of our competitor we may not be able to accurately predict technological trend or the success of new product and service if we choose technology or equipment that are le effective cost efficient or attractive to customer than those chosen by our competitor if we offer service that fail to appeal to consumer are not available at competitive price or that do not function expected or we are not able to fund the expenditure necessary to keep pace with technological development our competitive position could deteriorate and our business and financial result could suffer the ability of some of our competitor to introduce new technology product and service more quickly than we do may adversely affect our competitive position furthermore advance in technology decrease in the cost of existing technology or change in competitor product and service offering may require in the future to make additional research and development expenditure or to offer at no additional charge or at lower price certain product and service that we currently offer to customer separately or at premium in addition the uncertainty of our ability and the cost to obtain intellectual property right from third party could impact our ability to respond to technological advance in timely and effective manner our inability to maintain and expand our upgraded system and provide advanced service such state of the art user interface in timely manner or to anticipate the demand of the marketplace could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customer in addition we launch our new mobile service using virtual network operator right from third party we expect an initial funding period to grow new product well negative working capital impact from the timing of device related cash flow when we provide the handset or tablet pursuant to equipment installation plan consequently our growth financial condition and result of operation could suffer materially we depend on third party service provider supplier and licensors thus if we are unable to procure the necessary service equipment software or license on reasonable term and on timely basis our ability to offer service could be impaired and our growth operation business financial result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected we depend on limited number of third party service provider supplier and licensors to supply some of the service hardware software and operational support necessary to provide some of our service some of our hardware software and operational support vendor and service provider represent our sole source of supply or have either through contract or result of intellectual property right position of some exclusivity if any of these party breach or terminates it agreement with or otherwise fails to perform it obligation in timely manner demand exceeds these vendor capacity tariff are imposed that impact vendor ability to perform their obligation or significantly increase the amount we pay they experience operating or financial difficulty they significantly increase the amount we pay for necessary product or service or they cease production of any necessary product due to lack of demand profitability or change in ownership or are otherwise unable to provide the equipment or service we need in timely manner at our specification and at reasonable price our ability to provide some service might be materially adversely affected or the need to procure or develop alternative source of the affected material or service might delay our ability to serve our customer in addition the existence of only limited number of vendor of key technology can lead to le product innovation and higher cost these event could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain and attract customer and our operation business financial result and financial condition our business may be adversely affected if we can not continue to license or enforce the intellectual property right on which our business depends we rely on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law and license and other agreement with our employee customer supplier and other party to establish and maintain our intellectual property right in technology and the product and service used in our operation also because of the rapid pace of technological change we both develop our own technology product and service and rely on technology developed or licensed by third party however any of our intellectual property right or the right of our supplier could be challenged or invalidated or such intellectual property right may not be sufficient to permit to take advantage of current industry trend or otherwise to provide competitive advantage which could result in costly redesign effort discontinuance of certain product or service offering or other competitive harm we may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain license from these third party on reasonable term if at all in addition claim of intellectual property infringement could require to enter into royalty or licensing agreement on unfavorable term incur substantial monetary liability or be enjoined preliminarily or permanently from further use of the

risk related to regulatory and legislative mattersour business is subject to extensive governmental legislation and regulation which could adversely affect our business regulation of the cable industry ha increased cable operator operational and administrative expense and limited their revenue cable operator are subject to various law and regulation including those covering the following the provision of high speed internet service including transparency rule the provision of voice communication cable franchise renewal and transfer the provisioning and marketing of cable equipment and compatibility with new digital technology customer and employee privacy and data security limited rate regulation of video service copyright royalty for retransmitting broadcast signal when cable system must carry particular broadcast station and when it must first obtain retransmission consent to carry broadcast station the provision of channel capacity to unaffiliated commercial leased access programmer limitation on our ability to enter into exclusive agreement with multiple dwelling unit complex and control our inside wiring equal employment opportunity emergency alert system disability access technical standard marketing practice customer service and consumer protection and approval for merger and acquisition often accompanied by the imposition of restriction and requirement on an applicant business in order to secure approval of the proposed transaction legislator and regulator at all level of government frequently consider changing and sometimes do change existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or prescribe new one any future legislative judicial regulatory or administrative action may increase our cost or impose additional restriction on our business result of the closing of the transaction our business are subject to the condition set forth in the fcc order and the doj consent decree and those imposed by state utility commission and local franchise authority and there can be no assurance that these condition will not have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation in connection with the transaction the fcc order the doj consent decree and the approval from state utility commission and local franchise authority incorporated numerous commitment and voluntary condition made by the party and imposed numerous condition on our business relating to the operation of our business and other matter under federal approval among other thing we are not permitted to charge usage based price or impose data cap and are prohibited from charging interconnection fee for qualifying party ii we are prohibited from entering into or enforcing any agreement with programmer that forbids limit or creates incentive

per second and implementing reduced price high speed internet program for low income family these and other condition and commitment relating to the transaction are of varying duration ranging from three to seven year in light of the breadth and duration of the condition and potential change in market condition during the time the condition and commitment are in effect there can be no assurance that our compliance and ability to comply with the condition will not have material adverse effect on our business or result of operation for example in july the new york state public service commission revoked it earlier approval of charter acquistion of twc alleging that charter had not complied with it transaction commitment to extend availability of high speed internet service to underserved or unserved home or business over four year period although charter is viogrously opposing the public service commission revocation if this or any similar revocation is not reversed it could materially impact our operation see item legal proceeding change to existing statute rule regulation or interpretation thereof or adoption of new one could have an adverse effect on our business there are ongoing effort to amend or expand the federal state and local regulation of some of the service offered over our cable system which may compound the regulatory risk we already face for example with respect to our retail broadband internet access service the fcc ha reclassified the service twice in the last few year with the first change adding regulatory obligation and the second change largely removing those new regulatory obligation these change reflect lack of regulatory certainty in this business area which may continue result of litigation well future legislative or administrative change other potential legislative and regulatory change could adversely impact our business by increasing our cost and competition and limiting our ability to offer service in manner that that would maximize our revenue potential these change could include for example the adoption of new privacy restriction on our collection use and disclosure of certain customer information new data security and cybersecurity mandate that could result in additional network and information security requirement for our business new restraint on our discretion over programming decision including the provision of public educational and governmental access programming and unaffiliated commercial leased access programming new restriction on the rate we charge for video programming and the marketing of that video programming change to the cable industry compulsory copyright license to carry broadcast signal new requirement to assure the availability of navigation device such set top box from third party provider new universal service fund obligation on our provision of internet service that would add to the cost of that service increase in government administered broadband subsidy to rural area that could result in subsidized overbuilding of our more rural facility and change in the regulatory framework for voip phone service including the scope of regulatory obligation associated with our voip service and our ability to interconnect our voip service with incumbent provider of traditional telecommunication service if any of these such law or regulation are enacted they could affect our operation and require significant expenditure we can not predict future development in these area and we are already subject to charter specific condition regarding certain internet practice result of the fcc approval of the transaction but any change to the regulatory framework for our video internet or voip service could have negative impact on our business and result of operation it remains uncertain what rule change if any will ultimately be adopted by congress and the fcc and what operating or financial impact any such rule might have on including on our programming agreement customer privacy and the user experience in addition the fcc the ftc and various state agency and attorney general actively investigate industry practice and could impose substantial forfeiture for alleged regulatory violation our cable system franchise are subject to non renewal or termination and are non exclusive the failure to renew franchise or the grant of additional franchise in one or more service area could adversely affect our business our cable system generally operate pursuant to franchise permit and similar authorization issued by state or local governmental authority controlling the public right of way many franchise establish comprehensive facility and service requirement well specific customer service standard and monetary penalty for non compliance in many case franchise are terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with significant provision set forth in the franchise agreement governing system operation franchise are generally granted for fixed term and must be periodically renewed franchising authority may resist granting renewal if either past performance or the prospective operating proposal is considered inadequate franchise authority often demand concession or other commitment condition to renewal in some instance local franchise have not been renewed at expiration and we have operated and are operating under either temporary operating agreement or without franchise while negotiating renewal term with the local franchising authority we can not assure you that we will be able to comply with all significant provision of our franchise agreement and certain of our franchisers have from time to time alleged that we have not complied with these agreement additionally although historically have renewed our franchise without incurring significant cost we can not assure you that we will be able to renew or to renew favorably our franchise in the future termination of or sustained failure to renew franchise in one or more service area could adversely affect our business in the affected geographic area our cable system franchise are non exclusive consequently local and state franchising authority can grant additional franchise to competitor in the same geographic area or operate their own cable system in some case local government entity and municipal utility may legally compete with on more favorable term potential competitor like google have recently pursued and obtained local franchise that are more favorable than the incumbent operator franchise tax legislation and administrative initiative or challenge to our tax and fee position could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition we operate cable system in location throughout the united state and result we are subject to the tax law and regulation of federal state and local government from time to time various legislative and or administrative initiative may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax position there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payment will not be adversely affected by these initiative certain state and locality have imposed or are considering imposing new or additional tax or fee on our service or changing the methodology or base on which certain fee and tax are computed potential change include additional tax or fee on our service which could impact our customer change to income tax sourcing rule and other change to general business tax central unit level assessment of property tax and other matter that could increase our income franchise sale use and or property tax liability for example some local franchising authority are seeking to impose franchise fee assessment on our broadband internet access service and more may do so in the future if they do so and challenge to such assessment are unsuccessful it could adversely impact our cost in addition federal state and local tax law and regulation are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretation there can be no assurance that our tax position will not be challenged by relevant tax authority or that we would be successful in any such challenge item

while our capitalization is based on specific activity once capitalized we track these cost on composite basis by fixed asset category at the cable system level and not on specific asset basis for asset that are sold or retired we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation the cost of disconnecting service and removing customer premise equipment from dwelling and the cost to reconnect customer drop or to redeploy previously installed customer premise equipment are charged to operating incurred cost for repair and maintenance are charged to operating expense incurred while plant and equipment replacement including replacement of certain component betterment and replacement of cable drop and outlet are capitalized we make judgment regarding the installation and construction activity to be capitalized we capitalize direct labor and overhead using standard developed from actual cost and applicable operational data we calculate standard annually or more frequently if circumstance dictate for item such the labor rate overhead rate and the actual amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity for example the standard amount of time required to perform capitalizable activity are based on study of the time required to perform such activity overhead rate are established based on an analysis of the nature of cost incurred in support of capitalizable activity and determination of the portion of cost that is directly attributable to capitalizable activity the impact of change that resulted from these study were not material in the period presented labor cost directly associated with capital project are capitalized capitalizable activity performed in connection with installation include such activity dispatching truck roll to the customer dwelling or business for service connection or placement of new equipment verification of serviceability to the customer dwelling or business determining whether the customer dwelling is capable of receiving service by our cable network customer premise activity performed by in house field technician and third party contractor in connection with the installation replacement and betterment of equipment and material to enable video internet or voice service and verifying the integrity of the customer network connection by initiating test signal downstream from the headend to the customer premise equipment well testing signal level at the utility pole or pedestal judgment is required to determine the extent to which overhead cost incurred result from specific capital activity and therefore should be capitalized the primary cost that are included in the determination of the overhead rate are employee benefit and payroll tax associated with capitalized direct labor ii direct variable cost associated with capitalizable activity iii the cost of support personnel such care personnel and dispatcher who assist with capitalizable installation activity and iv indirect cost directly attributable to capitalizable activity while we believe our existing capitalization policy are appropriate significant change in the nature or extent of our system activity could affect management judgment about the extent to which we should capitalize direct labor or overhead in the future we monitor the appropriateness of our capitalization policy and perform update to our internal study on an ongoing basis to determine whether fact or circumstance warrant change to our capitalization policy we capitalized direct labor and overhead of billion billion and million respectively for the year ended december and valuation and impairment of property plant and equipment we evaluate the recoverability of our property plant and equipment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable such event or change in circumstance could include such factor the impairment of our indefinite life asset change in technological advance fluctuation in the fair value of such asset adverse change in relationship with local franchise authority adverse change in market condition or deterioration of current or expected future operating result long lived asset is deemed impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flow associated with the asset no impairment of long lived asset held for use were recorded in the year ended december and we utilize the cost approach the primary method used to establish fair value for our property plant and equipment in connection with business combination the cost approach considers the amount required to replace an asset by constructing or purchasing new asset with similar utility then adjusts the value in consideration of physical depreciation and functional and economic obsolescence of the valuation date the cost approach relies on management assumption regarding current material and labor cost required to rebuild and repurchase significant component of our property plant and equipment along with assumption regarding the age and estimated remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment useful life of property plant and equipment we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful life assigned to our property plant and equipment based on annual analysis of such useful life and revise such life to the extent warranted by changing fact and circumstance any change in estimated useful life result of this analysis are reflected prospectively beginning in the period in which the study is completed our analysis of useful life in did not indicate any significant change in useful life of our fixed asset the effect of one year decrease in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be an increase in annual depreciation expense of approximately million the effect of one year increase in the weighted average remaining useful life of our property plant and equipment of december would be decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million expense related to property plant and equipment totaled billion billion and billion for the year ended december and respectively representing approximately and of cost and expense respectively depreciation is recorded using the straight line composite method over management estimate of the useful life of the related asset listed below cable distribution yearscustomer premise equipment and yearsvehicles and yearsbuildings and yearsfurniture fixture and yearsintangible asset valuation and impairment of franchise the net carrying value of franchise of both december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset for more information and complete discussion of how we value and test franchise asset for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform an impairment assessment of franchise asset annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in circumstance we performed qualitative assessment in our assessment included consideration of fair value appraisal performed for tax purpose in the beginning of of december valuation date the appraisal along with multitude of factor that affect the fair value of our franchise asset example of such factor include environmental and competitive change within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margin equity and debt market trend including change in our market capitalization and change in our regulatory and political landscape among other factor based on our assessment we concluded that it wa more likely than not that the estimated fair value of our franchise asset equal or exceeds their carrying value and that quantitative impairment test is not required the appraisal indicated that the fair value of our franchise asset exceeded carrying value by approximately in the aggregate at our unit of accounting level for franchise asset impairment testing the amount by which fair value exceeded carrying value varied based on the extent to which the unit of accounting wa comprised of operation acquired in for unit of accounting comprised entirely or substantially of newly acquired operation the appraisal fair value exceeded carrying value by range of to due to the recency of the transaction while fair value for unit of accounting comprised of at least legacy charter operation exceeded carrying value by range of to valuation and impairment of goodwill the net carrying value of goodwill of both december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset for more information and complete discussion on how we test goodwill for impairment see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data we perform our impairment assessment of goodwill annually of november with our franchise impairment testing we elected to perform qualitative assessment of goodwill in which included the fair value appraisal and other factor described above based on the appraisal we determined that the fair value of our goodwill exceeded carrying value by approximately given the completion of the assessment and absence of significant adverse change in factor impacting our fair value estimate we concluded that it is more likely than not that our goodwill is not impaired valuation impairment and amortization of customer relationship the net carrying value of customer relationship of december and wa approximately billion representing of total asset and billion representing of total asset respectively amortization expense related to customer relationship for the year ended december and wa approximately billion billion and billion respectively no impairment of customer relationship wa recorded in the year ended december and for more information and complete discussion on our valuation methodology and amortization method see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statement contained in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data income tax of december charter had approximately billion of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards resulting in gross deferred tax asset of approximately billion these loss resulted from the operation of charter holdco and it subsidiary and from loss carryforwards received result of the twc transaction federal tax net operating loss carryforwards expire in the year through in addition of december charter had state tax net operating loss carryforwards in gross deferred tax asset net of federal tax benefit of approximately million state tax net operating loss carryforwards generally expire in the year through such tax loss carryforwards can accumulate and be used to offset charter future taxable income after december billion of charter federal tax loss carryforwards are subject to section and other restriction pursuant to these restriction charter estimate that approximately million annually over each of the next five year of federal tax loss carryforwards should become unrestricted and available for charter use an additional million is currently subject to valuation allowance charter state tax loss carryforwards are subject to similar but varying restriction income tax benefit for the year ended december wa recognized primarily result of the enactment of the tax cut job act tax reform in december among other thing the primary provision of tax reform impacting are the reduction to the corporate income tax rate from to and temporary bonus depreciation for certain asset the change in tax law required to remeasure existing net deferred tax liability using the lower rate in the period of enactment resulting in an income tax benefit of approximately billion to reflect these change in the year ended december in assessing the realizability of deferred tax asset management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized in evaluating the need for valuation allowance management take into account various factor including the expected level of future taxable income available tax planning strategy and reversal of existing taxable temporary difference due to legacy charter history of loss legacy charter wa historically unable to assume future taxable income in it analysis and accordingly valuation allowance were established against the deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liability from definite lived asset for book accounting purpose however result of the twc transaction in deferred tax liability resulting from the acquisition accounting increased significantly and future taxable income that will result from the reversal of existing temporary difference for which deferred tax liability are recognized is sufficient to conclude it is more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our deferred tax asset result in charter reversed approximately billion of it valuation allowance and recognized corresponding income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december approximately million of valuation allowance associated with federal tax net operating loss carryforwards and approximately million of valuation allowance associated with state tax loss carryforwards and other miscellaneous deferred tax asset remains on the december consolidated balance sheet in determining our tax provision for financial reporting purpose we establish reserve for uncertain tax position unless such position are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on their technical merit in evaluating whether tax position ha met the more likely than not recognition threshold we presume the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information tax position that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in our financial statement the tax position is measured the largest amount of benefit that ha greater than likelihood of being realized when the position is ultimately resolved there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether position taken on the tax return are more likely than not of being sustained we adjust our uncertain tax reserve estimate periodically because of ongoing examination by and settlement with the various taxing authority well change in tax law regulation and interpretation no tax year for charter or charter holdco for income tax purpose are currently under examination by the irs charter through tax year remain open for examination and assessment legacy charter tax year ending through the short period return dated may remain subject to examination and assessment year prior to remain open solely for purpose of examination of legacy charter loss and credit carryforwards the irs is currently examining charter holding income tax return for charter holding and tax year remain open for examination and assessment the irs is currently examining legacy twc income tax return for through legacy twc tax year remains subject to examination and assessment prior to legacy twc separation from time warner inc time warner in march the separation legacy twc wa included in the consolidated federal and certain state income tax return of time warner the irs is currently examining time warner through income tax return we do not anticipate that these examination will have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation in addition we are also subject to ongoing examination of our tax return by state and local tax authority for various period activity related to these state and local examination did not have material impact on our consolidated financial position or result of operation during the year ended december nor do we anticipate material impact in the future litigationlegal contingency have high degree of uncertainty when loss from contingency becomes estimable and probable reserve is established the reserve reflects management best estimate of the probable cost of ultimate resolution of the matter and is revised fact and circumstance change reserve is released when matter is ultimately brought to closure or the statute of limitation lapse we have established reserve for certain matter although these matter are not expected individually to have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity such matter could have in the aggregate material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition result of operation or liquidity programming agreement we exercise judgment in estimating programming expense associated with certain video programming contract our policy is to record video programming cost based on the substance of our contractual agreement with our programming vendor which are generally multi year agreement that provide for to make payment to the programming vendor at agreed upon market rate based on the number of customer to which we provide the programming service if programming contract expires prior to the party entry into new agreement and we continue to distribute the service we estimate the programming cost during the period there is no contract in place in doing so we consider the previous contractual rate inflation and the status of the negotiation in determining our estimate when the programming contract term are finalized an adjustment to programming expense is recorded if necessary to reflect the term of the new contract we also make estimate in the recognition of programming expense related to other item including the allocation of consideration exchanged between the party among the various item in multiple element transaction judgment is also involved when we enter into agreement that result in receiving cash consideration from the programming vendor usually in the form of advertising sale channel positioning fee launch support or marketing support in these situation we must determine based upon fact and circumstance if such cash consideration should be recorded revenue reduction in programming expense or reduction in another expense category marketing pension planswe sponsor two qualified defined benefit pension plan the

to market pension accounting policy for recording the actuarial gain or loss annually during the fourth quarter or earlier if remeasurement event occurs during an interim period we use december measurement date for our pension plan we recognized net periodic pension benefit of million million and million in and respectively net periodic pension benefit or expense is determined using certain assumption including the expected long term rate of return on plan asset discount rate and mortality assumption we determined the discount rate used to compute pension expense based on the yield of large population of high quality corporate bond with cash flow sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future defined benefit payment in developing the expected long term rate of return on asset we considered the current pension portfolio composition past average rate of earnings and our asset allocation target we used discount rate of from january to september and from october to december to compute pension expense decrease in the discount rate of basis point would result in million increase in our pension plan benefit obligation of december and net periodic pension expense recognized in under our mark to market accounting policy our expected long term rate of return on plan asset used to compute pension expense wa decrease in the expected long term rate of return of

given that there are no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor which limit the period over which these right will contribute to the company cash flow the company reassesses this determination periodically or whenever event or substantive change in circumstance occur all franchise are tested for impairment annually or more frequently warranted by event or change in

intangible asset ha been impaired if after this optional qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset ha been impaired then no further quantitative testing is necessary in completing the qualitative impairment testing the company evaluates multitude of factor that affect the fair value of our franchise asset example of such factor include environmental and competitive change within our operating footprint actual and projected operating performance the consistency of our operating margin equity and debt market trend including change in our market capitalization and change in our regulatory and political landscape among other factor the company performed qualitative assessment in which also included consideration of fair value appraisal performed for tax purpose in the beginning of of december valuation date the appraisal after consideration of the qualitative factor in including the result of the appraisal the company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise asset in each unit of accounting exceeds the carrying value of such asset and therefore did not perform quantitative analysis at the assessment date periodically the company will elect to perform quantitative analysis for impairment testing if the company elect or is required to perform quantitative analysis to test it franchise asset for impairment the methodology described below is utilized if quantitative analysis is performed the estimated fair value of franchise is determined utilizing an income approach model based on the present value of the estimated discrete future cash flow attributable to each of the intangible asset identified assuming discount rate the fair value of franchise is determined based on estimated discrete discounted future cash flow using assumption consistent with internal forecast the franchise after tax cash flow is calculated the after tax cash flow generated by the potential customer obtained the sum of the present value of the franchise after tax cash flow in year through and the continuing value of the after tax cash flow beyond year yield the fair value of the franchise this approach make use of unobservable factor such projected revenue expense capital expenditure customer trend and discount rate applied to the estimated cash flow the determination of the franchise discount rate is derived from the company weighted average cost of capital which us market participant cost of equity and after tax cost of debt and reflects the risk inherent in the cash flow the company estimate discounted future cash flow using reasonable and appropriate assumption including among others penetration rate for video internet and voice revenue growth rate operating margin and capital expenditure the assumption are based on the company and it peer historical operating performance adjusted for current and expected competitive and economic factor surrounding the cable industry the estimate and assumption made in the company valuation are inherently subject to significant uncertainty many of which are beyond it control and there is no assurance that these result can be achieved the primary assumption for which there is reasonable possibility of the occurrence of variation that would significantly affect the measurement value include the assumption regarding revenue growth programming expense growth rate the amount and timing of capital expenditure actual customer trend and the discount rate utilized the fair value of goodwill is determined using both an income approach and market approach the company income approach model used for it goodwill valuation is consistent with that used for it franchise valuation noted above except that cash flow from the entire business enterprise are used for the goodwill valuation the company market approach model estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on market

accounting guidance also permit an optional qualitative assessment for goodwill to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of reporting unit exceeds it fair value if after this qualitative assessment the company determines that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount then no further quantitative testing would be necessary if the company elect or is required to perform the two step test under the accounting guidance the first step involves comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying amount if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds it carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment is not necessary if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed and comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to it carrying amount to determine the amount of impairment if any with the company franchise impairment testing in the company elected to perform qualitative goodwill impairment assessment which incorporated the result of the appraisal and consideration of the same qualitative factor relevant to the company franchise impairment testing result of that assessment the company concluded that goodwill is not impaired customer relationship are recorded at fair value of the date acquired le accumulated amortization customer relationship for valuation purpose represent the value of the business relationship with existing customer and are calculated by projecting the discrete future after tax cash flow from these customer including the right to deploy and market additional service to these customer the present value of these after tax cash flow yield the fair value of the customer relationship the use of different valuation assumption or definition of franchise or customer relationship such our inclusion of the value of selling additional service to our current customer within customer relationship versus franchise could significantly impact our valuation and any resulting impairment customer relationship are amortized on an accelerated sum of year digit method over useful life of year based on the period over which current customer are expected to generate cash flow the company periodically evaluates the remaining useful life of it customer relationship to determine whether event or circumstance warrant revision to the remaining period of amortization customer relationship are evaluated for impairment upon the occurrence of event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable customer relationship are deemed impaired when the carrying value exceeds the projected undiscounted future cash flow associated with the customer relationship no impairment of
