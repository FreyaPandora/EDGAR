channel relationship in new industry segment and with disruptive technology product and service such product for automotive computing iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics and networking among others identify potential acquisition target that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic need reach agreement on term acceptable to close the transaction and effectively integrate these new business product and technology be leader serving original equipment manufacturer oems high level operating system hlos provider operator cloud provider and other industry participant competitor new industry entrant and other factor continue to affect the industry landscape be preferred partner and sustain preferred relationship providing integrated circuit product that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platform to industry participant that effectively commercialize new device using these platform and continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known company in computing and other consumer driven segment and to deepen our presence in significant emerging region and china we compete with many different semiconductor company ranging from multinational company with integrated research and development manufacturing sale and marketing organization across broad spectrum of product line to company that are focused on single application market segment or standard product including those that produce product for automotive computing iot and networking application most of these competitor compete with with respect to some but not all of our business company that design integrated circuit based on cdma ofdma wi fi or their derivative are generally competitor or potential competitor example some of which are strategic partner of ours in other area include broadcom cirrus logic cypress semiconductor hisilicon intel marvell maxim mediatek microchip technology murata nordic semiconductor nvidia nxp semiconductor qorvo realtek semiconductor renesas samsung sequans communication skyworks and spreadtrum communication which is controlled by tsinghua unigroup some of these current and potential competitor may have advantage over that include among others motivation by our customer in certain circumstance to use our competitor integrated circuit product to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or sell such product to others or to choose alternative technology lower cost structure or willingness and ability to accept lower price or lower or negative margin for their product particularly in china foreign government support of other technology competitor or oems that sell device that do not contain our chipsets better known brand name ownership and control of manufacturing facility and greater expertise in manufacturing process more extensive relationship with local distribution company and oems in certain geographic region such china more experience in adjacent industry segment outside traditional cellular industry such automotive computing iot and networking and more established presence in certain region in particular certain of our largest integrated circuit customer develop their own integrated circuit product which have in the past utilized and currently utilize in certain of their device and may in the future choose to utilize in certain or all of their device rather than our product and they may sell their integrated circuit product to third party discretely or together with certain of their other product in competition with also apple which ha historically been one of our largest customer now utilizes product of one of our competitor in many of their device rather than our product and is solely utilizing one of our competitor product in it most recent smartphone launch apple may continue to use our competitor product in one or more of it future device and may develop and utilize it own modem product rather than our product in one or more of it future device certain of our competitor develop and sell multiple component including integrated circuit product for use in device and sell those component together to device manufacturer our competitor sale of multiple component put and our discrete integrated circuit product at competitive disadvantage certain of our competitor also develop and sell infrastructure equipment for wireless network and can optimize their integrated circuit product to perform on such network to degree that we are not able to which put at competitive disadvantage competition in any or all product tier may result in the loss of business or customer which would negatively impact our revenue result of operation and cash flow such competition may also reduce average selling price for our chipset product or the product of our customer and licensee certain of these dynamic are particularly pronounced in emerging region and china where competitor may have lower cost structure or may have willingness and ability to accept lower price or lower or negative margin on their product particularly in china reduction in the average selling price of our chipset product without corresponding increase in volume would negatively impact our revenue and without corresponding decrease in average unit cost would negatively impact our margin in addition reduction in the average selling price of our licensee product unless offset by an increase in volume would generally decrease total royalty payable to negatively impacting our licensing revenue we derive significant portion of our revenue from small number of customer and licensee which increasingly includes small number of chinese oems if revenue derived from these customer or licensee decrease or the timing of such revenue fluctuates our business and result of operation could be negatively affected our qct segment derives significant portion of it revenue from small number of customer and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among few company particularly at the premium tier contributing to this trend chinese oems continue to grow their device share in china and are increasing their device share in region outside of china and we derive significant and increasing portion of our revenue from small number of these oems in addition certain of our largest integrated circuit customer develop their own integrated circuit product which they have in the past utilized and currently utilize in certain of their device and may in the future choose to utilize in certain or all of their device rather than our product and they may sell their integrated circuit product to third party discretely or together with certain of their other product in competition with also apple which ha historically been one of our largest customer utilizes product of one of our competitor in many of their device rather than our product and is solely utilizing one of our competitor product in it most recent smartphone launch in april we entered into new multi year chipset supply agreement with apple we do not expect to begin recording revenue under this agreement the second half of fiscal however apple may continue to use our competitor product in one or more of it future device and may develop and utilize it own modem product rather than our product in one or more of it future device similarly certain of our chinese oem customer have developed and others may in the future develop their own integrated circuit product and use such integrated circuit product or other integrated circuit product in their device rather than our integrated circuit product whether due to pressure from the chinese government part of it broader economic policy the oems concern over losing access to our integrated circuit product result of chinese trade tension or otherwise further political action including trade and or national security protection policy or other action by government have in the past currently are and could in the future limit or prevent from transacting business with certain of our customer or limit or prevent certain of our customer from transacting business with finally we spend significant amount of engineering and development time fund and resource in understanding our key customer feedback and or specification and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launch and technology these effort may not require or result in purchase commitment from such customer or we may have lower purchase from such customer than expected and consequently we may not achieve the anticipated revenue from these effort or these effort may result in non recoverable cost the loss of any one of our significant customer reduction in the purchase of our product by such customer or the cancelation of significant purchase by any of these customer whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product government restriction or otherwise would reduce our revenue and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected result of operation and delay of significant purchase even if only temporary would reduce our revenue in the period of the delay any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development further the concentration of device share among few company and the corresponding purchasing power of these company may result in lower price for our product which if not accompanied by sufficient increase in the volume of purchase of our product could have an adverse effect on our revenue and margin in addition the timing and size of purchase by our significant customer may be impacted by timing of such customer new or next generation product introduction over which we have no control and the timing and success of such introduction may cause our revenue and result of operation to fluctuate accordingly if current industry dynamic continue our qct segment revenue will continue to depend largely upon and be impacted by future purchase and the timing and size of any such future purchase by these significant customer further to the extent apple purchase our modem product it purchase our mobile data modem mdm product which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contribution than our combined modem and application processor product to the extent apple take device share from our customer purchase our integrated modem and application processor product our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted further company that develop hlos for device including leading technology company sell their own device if we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these company or with their partner or customer they may decide not to purchase either directly or through their contract manufacturer or to reduce or discontinue their purchase of our integrated circuit product in addition there ha been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customer and other industry participant and the potential outcome of such litigation including but not limited to injunction against device that incorporate our product or intellectual property and ruling on certain patent law or patent licensing issue that create new legal precedent could impact our business particularly if such action impact one of our larger customer although we have more than licensee our qtl segment derives significant portion of it revenue from limited number of licensee which increasingly includes small number of chinese oems in the event that one or more of our significant licensee fail to meet their reporting and payment obligation or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreement under similar term our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be adversely impacted moreover the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensee to develop introduce and deliver high volume product that achieve and sustain customer acceptance we have no control over the product development sale effort or pricing of product by our licensee and our licensee might not be successful reduction in sale of our licensee product or reduction in the average selling price of wireless device sold by our licensee without sufficient increase in the volume of such device sold would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenue such adverse impact may be mitigated by the per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet laptop and smartwatches we derive significant portion of our revenue from the premium tier device segment if sale of premium tier device decrease or sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product decrease our result of operation could be negatively affected we derive significant portion of our revenue from the premium tier device segment and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future we have experienced and expect to continue to experience slowing growth in the premium tier device segment due to among other factor lengthening replacement cycle in developed region where premium tier smartphones are common increasing consumer demand in emerging region and china where premium tier smartphones are le common and replacement cycle are on average longer than in developed region and are continuing to lengthen and maturing premium tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and innovation cycle in addition discussed in the prior risk factor our industry is experiencing concentration of device share at the premium tier among few company which give them significant leverage further certain of those company have in the past utilized currently utilize and may in the future utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product or our competitor integrated circuit product rather than our product in all or portion of their device these dynamic may result in reduced sale of or lower price for our premium tier integrated circuit product reduction in sale of premium tier device reduction in sale of our premium tier integrated circuit product which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower tier integrated circuit product or shift in share away from oems that utilize our product to oems that do not utilize our product would reduce our revenue and margin and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial result any such reduction in revenue would also impact our cash resource available for other purpose such research and development effort by some communication equipment manufacturer or their customer to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business time to time company initiate various strategy to attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property these strategy have included litigation often alleging infringement of patent held by such company patent misuse patent exhaustion patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patent or license that we do not license our patent on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory frand term or some form of unfair competition or competition law violation ii taking position contrary to our understanding and or the plain language of their contract with iii appeal to governmental authority iv collective action including working with wireless operator standard body other like minded company and organization on both formal and informal base to adopt intellectual property policy and practice that could have the effect of limiting return on intellectual property innovation lobbying governmental regulator and elected official for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rate or the base on which royalty are calculated seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening patent holder ability to enforce it right or obtain fair return for such right and vi various attempt by licensee to shift their royalty obligation to their supplier that result in lowering the wholesale licensee selling price on which the royalty is calculated in addition certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property further certain licensee and company are currently engaged in such behavior and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or not enter into new license agreement further to the extent such licensee and company increase their device share the negative impact of their underreporting underpayment non payment or non reporting on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and cash flow will be exacerbated we have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigation and proceeding including the lawsuit filed against by the united state federal trade commission ftc certain of these matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future additionally certain of our direct and indirect customer and licensee have pursued and others may in the future pursue litigation or arbitration against related to our business unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and cash flow see the risk factor below entitled our business particularly our licensing business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding and change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation or private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation in addition in connection with our participation in sdos we like other patent owner generally have made contractual commitment to such organization to license those of our patent that would necessarily be infringed by standard compliant product set forth in those commitment some manufacturer and user of standard compliant product advance interpretation of these commitment that are adverse to our licensing business including interpretation that would limit the amount of royalty that we could collect on the licensing of our standard essential patent portfolio further some company or entity have proposed significant change to existing intellectual property policy for implementation by sdos and other industry organization with the goal of significantly devaluing standard essential patent for example some have put forth proposal which would require maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard essential patent owned by all of the member company to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard they have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard essential patent based upon the number of standard essential patent held by such company others have proposed that injunction should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard essential patent and have made proposal that could severely limit damage award and other remedy by court for patent infringement by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied number of these strategy are purportedly based on interpretation of the policy of certain sdos concerning the licensing of patent that are or may be essential to industry standard and on our or other company alleged failure to abide by these policy some sdos court and governmental agency have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretation or proposal in manner adverse to our interest including in litigation to which we may not be party we expect that such proposal interpretation and strategy will continue in the future and if successful our business model would be harmed either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalty or by reducing the royalty we can collect on all or portion of our standard essential patent portfolio limiting our return on investment with respect to new limiting our ability to seek injunction against infringers of our standard essential patent constraining our ability to make licensing commitment when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standard which could make our technology le likely to be included in such standard or forcing to work outside of sdos or other industry group to promote our new technology and our revenue result of operation and cash flow could be negatively impacted in addition the legal and other cost associated with asserting or defending our position have been and continue to be significant we assume that such challenge regardless of their merit will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource our business particularly our licensing business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding we have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigation and proceeding particularly with respect to our licensing business including the lawsuit filed against by the ftc certain of these matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency key allegation or finding in those matter include among others that we violate frand licensing commitment by refusing to grant license to chipset maker that our royalty rate are high that the base on which our royalty are calculated should be something le than the wholesale licensee selling price of the applicable device minus certain permitted deduction that we unlawfully require customer to execute patent license we sell them cellular modem chipsets that we have entered into exclusive agreement with chipset customer that foreclose competition and that we violate antitrust law engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair method of competition we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and cash flow depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable if some or all of our license agreement are declared invalid or unenforceable and or we are required to renegotiate these license agreement we may not receive or may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenue under the impacted license agreement unless and until we enter into new license agreement and even licensee whose license agreement are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreement or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreement and we may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenue under such agreement the renegotiation of license agreement could lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing term which could be le favorable to than existing term each of which could take month or possibly year licensee may underreport underpay not report or not pay royalty owed to pending the conclusion of such negotiation arbitration or litigation in addition we may be sued for alleged overpayment of past royalty paid to including private antitrust action seeking treble damage under antitrust law further if our appeal in the ftc lawsuit is unsuccessful it could have material adverse effect on our business any such event could result in materially negative impact on our financial condition in which case we would have to significantly cut cost and other us of cash including in research and development significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technology such further depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstance above we may have to reduce or eliminate our capital return program and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted if these event occur our financial outlook and stock price could decline possibly significantly further governmental body in particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region these challenge have required and we expect that they will continue to require the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted and we expect that they will continue to result in increased legal cost until the respective matter are resolved change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation or private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation described in the risk factor above entitled our business particularly our licensing business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding we have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigation and proceeding and private legal proceeding challenging our patent licensing and chipset sale practice including the lawsuit filed against by the ftc certain of these matter are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we believe that one intent these investigation and legal proceeding is to reduce the amount of royalty that licensee are required to pay to for their use of our intellectual property we may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigation or proceeding in the future we historically licensed our cellular standard essential patent together with our other patent that may be useful to licensed product because licensee desired to obtain the commercial benefit of receiving such broad patent right from however we also licensed only our cellular standard essential patent to certain licensee who requested such license since our standard practice in china is to offer license to our and and now cellular standard essential chinese patent for device sold for use in china separately from our other patent in addition we also offer license to only our cellular standard essential patent including and for both single mode and multimode device on worldwide basis and since an increasing number of new and existing licensee have elected to enter into worldwide license agreement covering only our cellular standard essential patent going forward we continue to anticipate that significant portion of our licensing revenue will be derived from licensee that have entered into license agreement covering only our cellular standard essential patent our royalty rate for license to only our cellular standard essential patent are lower than our royalty rate for license to substantially all of our patent portfolio if more licensee choose license to only our cellular standard essential patent instead of portfolio license than ha historically been the case our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patent at rate that offset all or portion of any difference between the royalty previously received for license of substantially all of our patent portfolio compared to license of only our cellular standard essential patent or there wa sufficient increase in the overall volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid if we were required to grant patent license to chipset manufacturer which could lead to implementing more complex multi level licensing structure in which we license certain portion of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturer and other portion to device manufacturer we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we could incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed in addition our licensing revenue and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain in the aggregate equivalent revenue under such multi level licensing structure if we were required to reduce the royalty rate we charge under our patent license agreement our revenue earnings and cash flow would be negatively impacted absent sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid similarly if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated our revenue result of operation and cash flow would be negatively impacted unless there wa sufficient increase in the volume of sale of device upon which royalty are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rate to offset the decrease in revenue resulting from such lower royalty base assuming the absolute royalty dollar were below any relevant royalty cap if we were required to sell chipsets to oems that do not have license to our patent our licensing program could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claim raised by such unlicensed oems claim that our sale of chipsets to such oems forecloses from asserting any patent substantially embodied by the chipsets against such oems such sale would provide oems with defense in the event we asserted our patent against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patent this would have material adverse effect on our licensing program and our result of operation financial condition and cash flow to the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing and or business practice including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreement or pursuing other commercial arrangement we would incur additional transaction cost which may be significant and we could incur delay in recognizing revenue until license negotiation were completed the impact of any such change to our licensing practice could vary widely and by jurisdiction depending on the specific outcome and the geographic scope of such outcome in addition if we were required to make modification to our licensing practice in one jurisdiction licensee or governmental agency in other jurisdiction may attempt to obtain similar outcome for or for such other jurisdiction applicable finally if our appeal in the ftc lawsuit is unsuccessful it could have material adverse effect on our business the enforcement and protection of our intellectual property right may be expensive could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property right could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patent and could be adversely affected by change in patent law by law in certain foreign jurisdiction that may not effectively protect our intellectual property right and by ineffective enforcement of law in such jurisdiction we rely primarily on patent copyright trademark and trade secret law well nondisclosure and confidentiality agreement international treaty and other method to protect our proprietary information technology and process including our patent portfolio policing unauthorized use of our product technology and proprietary information is difficult time consuming the step we have taken have not always prevented and we can not be certain the step we will take in the future will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technology particularly in foreign country where the law may not protect our proprietary intellectual property right fully or readily law or where the enforcement of such law may be lacking or ineffective some industry participant who have vested interest in devaluing patent in general or standard essential patent in particular have mounted attack on certain patent system increasing the likelihood of change to established patent law in the united state there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law change and current and potential future litigation regarding patent the outcome of which could be detrimental to our licensing business the law in certain foreign country in which our product are or may be manufactured or sold including certain country in asia may not protect our intellectual property right to the same extent the law in the united state we expect that the european union eu will adopt unitary patent system in the next few year that may broadly impact that region patent regime we can not predict with certainty the long term effect of any potential change in addition we can not be certain that the law and policy of any country or the practice of any standard body foreign or domestic with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standard will not be changed in the future in way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our product or technology we have had currently have and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstance in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property right and contract including collecting royalty for use of our patent portfolio due to among others refusal by certain licensee to report and pay all or portion of the royalty they owe to policy of foreign government challenge to our licensing practice under competition law adoption of mandatory licensing provision by foreign jurisdiction failure of foreign court to recognize and enforce judgment of contract breach and damage issued by court in the united state and challenge before competition agency to our licensing business and the pricing and integration of additional feature and functionality into our chipset product certain licensee have disputed underreported underpaid not reported or not paid royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reported to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation and certain company have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreement for their use of our intellectual property further certain licensee and company are currently engaged in such behavior and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future the fact that one or more licensee dispute underreport underpay do not report or do not pay royalty owed to may encourage other licensee to take similar action and may encourage other licensee or unlicensed company to delay entering into or not enter into new license agreement additionally although our license agreement provide with the right to audit the book and record of licensee audit can be expensive time consuming incomplete and subject to dispute further certain licensee may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their book and record to the extent we do not aggressively enforce our right under our license agreement licensee may not comply with their existing license agreement and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed company to enter into license agreement with for their use of our intellectual property other unlicensed company may not enter into license agreement similarly we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary and confidential business information to our direct and indirect customer and licensee who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such intellectual property and information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and information to third party including our competitor we have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property right protect our trade secret or determine the validity and scope of proprietary right of others result of any such litigation or arbitration we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patent portion of our license agreement could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable which may in turn result in other licensee either not complying with their existing license agreement or initiating litigation license term including but not limited to royalty rate for the use of our intellectual property could be imposed that are le favorable to than existing term and we could incur substantial cost any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property right could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention which in turn could negatively impact our result of operation and cash flow further even positive resolution to our enforcement effort may take time to conclude which may reduce our revenue and cash resource available for other purpose such research and development in the period prior to conclusion our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technology product and service into new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment and application outside of traditional cellular industry such automotive computing iot and networking among others our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area industry segment and application and related technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such may not generate operating income or contribute to future result of operation that meet our expectation industry is subject to rapid technological change evolving industry standard and frequent new product introduction and we must make substantial research development and other investment such acquisition in new product service and technology to compete successfully technological innovation generally require significant research and development effort before they are commercially viable while we continue to invest significant resource toward advancement primarily in support of and based technology we also invest in new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and application by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisition in particular our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product area such rffe and adjacent industry segment and application outside of traditional cellular industry such automotive computing iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics and networking among others our ability to develop leading and cost effective technology product and service for new and expanded product area adjacent industry segment and application and third party incorporating our technology product and service into device used in these product area industry segment and application accordingly we intend to continue to make substantial investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and application and in developing new product service and technology for these product area industry segment and application our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent technology and to develop and commercialize product using technology however our research development and other investment in these new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment and application and corresponding technology product and service well in our existing technology product and service and new technology such use of licensed shared and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and wi fi may not succeed due to among other reason we may not be issued patent on the technology we develop the technology we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standard new and expanded product area and adjacent industry segment application and consumer demand may not develop or grow anticipated our strategy or the strategy of our customer licensee or partner may not be successful improvement in alternate technology in way that reduce the advantage we anticipate from our investment competitor technology product or service being more cost effective having more capability or fewer limitation or being brought to market faster than our new technology product and service we may not be able to develop or our competitor may have more established and or stronger customer vendor distributor or other channel relationship and competitor having longer operating history in industry segment that are new to we may also underestimate the cost of or overestimate the future revenue or margin that could result from these investment and these investment may not or may take many year to generate material return further the automotive industry is subject to long design in time frame long product life cycle and high degree of regulatory and safety requirement necessitating supplier to the industry to comply with stringent qualification process very low defect rate and high reliability standard all of which result in significant barrier to entry and increased cost if our new technology product and service are not successful or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate we may incur significant cost and asset impairment our business may not grow meaningfully our revenue and margin may be negatively impacted and our reputation may be harmed there are numerous risk associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facility including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability exposure to natural disaster timely supply of equipment and material and various manufacturing issue while our qct segment ha historically utilized fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made we own and operate various facility that manufacture our rffe module and rf filter acoustic product manufacturing facility are characterized by higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model we may be faced with decline in the utilization rate of our manufacturing facility due to decrease in demand for our product including in le favorable industry environment during such period our manufacturing facility could operate at lower capacity level while the fixed cost associated with full capacity continue to be incurred resulting in lower gross profit we are subject to many environmental health and safety law and regulation in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facility which govern among other thing emission of pollutant into the air wastewater discharge the use and handling of hazardous substance waste disposal the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employee we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permit from governmental authority for certain of our operation while we continue to take measure to comply we can not make assurance that we will be at all time in compliance with such law regulation and permit certain environmental law strict and in certain circumstance joint and several liability on current or previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of investigation removal or remediation of hazardous substance certain of these law also ass liability on person who arrange for hazardous substance to be sent to disposal or treatment facility when such facility are found to be contaminated in addition we could also be held liable for consequence arising of human exposure to hazardous substance or other environmental damage we have manufacturing facility in asia and europe if tsunami flooding earthquake volcanic eruption or other natural disaster or geopolitical conflict were to damage destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facility it could disrupt our operation delay new production and shipment of inventory and result in costly repair replacement or other cost in addition natural disaster or geopolitical conflict may result in disruption in transportation distribution channel and supply chain and significant increase in the price of raw material our manufacturing operation depend on securing raw material and other supply in adequate quality and quantity in timely manner from multiple supplier and in some case we rely on limited number of supplier particularly in asia accordingly there may be case where supply of raw material and other product are interrupted by disaster accident or some other event at supplier supply is suspended due to quality or other issue or there is shortage of supply due to rapid increase in demand which could impact production and prevent from supplying product to our customer if the supply demand balance is disrupted it may considerably increase cost of manufacturing due to increased price we pay for raw material from time to time supplier may extend lead time limit the amount supplied to or increase price due to capacity constraint or other factor additionally supply and cost of raw material may be negatively impacted by trade and or national security protection policy such tariff or action by government that limit or prevent from transacting business with certain company or that limit or prevent certain company from transacting business with or escalating trade tension particularly with country in asia further it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another failure by our supplier to deliver our requirement could result in disruption to our manufacturing operation our manufacturing process are highly complex require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yield and performance difficulty in the production process can reduce yield or interrupt production and result we may not be able to deliver product or do in timely cost effective or competitive manner further to remain competitive and meet customer demand we may be required to improve our facility and process technology and carry out extensive research and development each of which may require investment of significant amount of capital and may have material adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow finally we typically begin manufacturing our product using our or our customer forecast of customer demand which are based on number of assumption and estimate and are generally not covered by purchase commitment result we incur inventory and manufacturing cost in advance of anticipated sale which sale ultimately may not materialize or may be lower than expected if we or our customer overestimate customer demand that is not under binding commitment from our customer we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating cost and or increased excess or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our result of operation the continued and future success of our licensing program requires to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and our licensing program may be impacted by the proliferation of device in new industry segment such automotive computing iot and networking well the need to renew or renegotiate license agreement that are expiring or to cover additional future patent we own very strong portfolio of issued and pending patent related to and other technology it is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio particularly in if we do not maintain strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standard product and service particularly our future licensing revenue could be negatively impacted in addition new connectivity and other service are emerging that rely on device that may or may not be used on traditional cellular network such device used in the automotive computing iot and networking industry segment standard even de facto standard that develop these technology mature in particular those that do not include base level of interoperability may impact our ability to obtain royalty at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for product used in cellular communication although we believe that our patented technology are essential and useful to the commercialization of such service any royalty we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program further the license granted to and from under number of our license agreement include only patent that are either filed or issued prior to certain date result there are agreement with some licensee where later patent are not licensed by or to additionally all of our patent license agreement in china that were entered into in or thereafter our recent worldwide cellular standard essential patent only agreement are effective for specified term in order to license or to obtain license to such later patent or after the expiration of the specified term and to receive royalty after the expiration date of the specified term we will need to extend or modify such license agreement or enter into new license agreement with such licensee more frequently than we have done historically in particular our license agreement with certain of our key chinese licensee expire at the end of calendar year we might not be able to extend or modify those license agreement or enter into new license agreement in the future without negatively affecting the material term and condition of our license agreement with such licensee and such modification or new agreement may negatively impact our revenue in some circumstance we may extend modify or enter into new license agreement result of arbitration or litigation and term imposed by arbitrator or court may be le favorable to than existing term if there is delay in extending modifying or entering into new license agreement with licensee there would be delay in our ability to recognize revenue related to that licensee product sale further if we are unable to reach agreement on such modification or new agreement it could result in patent infringement litigation with such company we depend on limited number of third party supplier for the procurement manufacture and testing of our product manufactured in fable production model if we fail to execute supply strategy that provide technology leadership supply assurance and low cost our business and result of operation may be harmed we are also subject to order and shipment uncertainty that could negatively impact our result of operation our qct segment primarily utilizes fable production model which mean that we do not own or operate foundry for the production of silicon wafer from which our integrated circuit are made other than the facility we own that manufacture our rffe module and rf filter acoustic product we rely on independent third party supplier to perform the manufacturing and assembly and most of the testing of our integrated circuit our supplier are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw material used in the production of our integrated circuit we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing model to purchase our integrated circuit under the turnkey model our foundry supplier are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuit under the two stage manufacturing model we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundry and contract with separate third party supplier for manufacturing service such wafer bump probe assembly and the majority of our final test requirement the semiconductor manufacturing foundry that supply product to our qct segment are primarily located in asia are our primary warehouse where we store finished good for fulfillment of customer order the following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenue business operation profitability and cash flow reduction interruption delay or limitation in our product supply source failure by our supplier to procure raw material or to provide or allocate adequate raw material manufacturing or test capacity for our product our supplier inability to react to shift in product demand or an increase in raw material or component price our supplier delay in developing leading process technology or inability to develop or maintain leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance quality or yield specification or delivery schedule additional expense or production delay result of qualifying new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of loss of or decision to add or change supplier and natural disaster or geopolitical conflict impacting our supplier additionally supply and cost of raw material may be negatively impacted by trade or national security protection policy such tariff or action by government that limit or prevent from transacting business with certain company or that limit or prevent certain company from transacting business with or escalating trade tension particularly with country in asia while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology we rely on sole or limited source supplier for certain product subjecting to significant risk including possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedule manufacturing capability and yield quality assurance quantity and cost to the extent we have established alternate supplier these supplier may require significant level of support to bring complex technology to production result we may invest significant amount of effort and resource and incur higher cost to support and maintain such alternate supplier further any future consolidation of foundry supplier could increase our vulnerability to sole or limited source arrangement and reduce our supplier willingness to negotiate pricing which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reduction and could increase our manufacturing cost our arrangement with our supplier may obligate to incur cost to manufacture and test our product that do not decrease at the same rate decrease in pricing to our customer our ability and that of our supplier to develop or leading process technology including transition to smaller geometry process technology and to effectively compete with the manufacturing process and performance of our competitor could impact our ability to introduce new product and meet customer demand could increase our cost possibly decreasing our margin and could subject to the risk of excess inventory any of the above could negatively impact our business result of operation and cash flow although we have long term contract with our supplier many of these contract do not provide for long term capacity commitment to the extent we do not have firm commitment from our supplier over specific time period or for any specific quantity our supplier may allocate and in the past have allocated capacity to the production and testing of product for their other customer while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our product accordingly capacity for our product may not be available when we need it or at reasonable price to the extent we do obtain long term capacity commitment we may incur additional cost related to those commitment or make non refundable payment for capacity commitment that are not used our supplier or potential alternate supplier may manufacture cdma or ofdma based integrated circuit for themselves or for other company that compete with our product such supplier have in the past and could again elect to allocate raw material and manufacturing capacity to their own product or product of our competitor and reduce or limit delivery to to our detriment in addition we may not receive reasonable pricing manufacturing or delivery term from our supplier we can not guarantee that the action of our supplier will not cause disruption in our operation that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation to our customer or increase our cost of sale to the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply we may be obligated to make payment to our customer for such shortfall additionally we place order with our supplier using our and our customer forecast of customer demand which are based on number of assumption and estimate we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase result the order we place with our supplier are generally only partially covered by commitment from our customer if we or our customer overestimate customer demand that is not under binding commitment from our customer we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory which would negatively impact our result of operation claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business from time to time company have asserted and may again assert patent copyright and other intellectual property right against our product or product using our technology or other technology used in our industry these claim have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation we may not prevail in such litigation given among other factor the complex technical issue and inherent uncertainty in intellectual property litigation if any of our product or service were found to infringe another company intellectual property right we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our product or service which could be costly or to license such right or pay damage or other compensation to such other company if we are unable to redesign our product or service license such intellectual property right used in our product or service or otherwise distribute our product through licensed supplier we could be prohibited from making and selling such product or providing such service similarly our supplier could be found to infringe another company intellectual property right and such supplier could be enjoined from providing product or service to in any potential dispute involving and another company patent or other intellectual property our chipset foundry semiconductor assembly and test provider and customer could also become the target of litigation we are contingently liable under certain product sale service license and other agreement to indemnify certain customer chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider against certain type of liability and damage arising from qualifying claim of patent infringement by product or service sold or provided by or by intellectual property provided by to our chipset foundry and semiconductor assembly and test service provider reimbursement under indemnification arrangement could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow furthermore any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our product and the business of our chipset customer and their customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our chipset sale or reduction in our licensee sale causing corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenue any claim regardless of their merit could be time consuming to address result in costly litigation divert the effort of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delay any of which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation and cash flow we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative body such the united state international trade commission to defend against patent assertion against our product by company some of are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiation we may not be successful in such proceeding and if we are not the range of possible outcome is very broad and may include for example monetary or fine or other order to pay money royalty payment injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit product or on the sale of our customer device using such product or the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice further governmental body in particular country or region may assert and may be successful in imposing remedy with effect that extend beyond the border of that country or region in addition negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customer and their wireless operator customer which in turn could harm our relationship with them and could result in decline in our worldwide chipset sale or reduction in our licensee sale to wireless operator causing corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenue certain legal matter which may include certain claim by other company that we infringe their intellectual property are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency we may engage in strategic acquisition transaction or make investment or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisition which could adversely affect our result of operation or fail to enhance stockholder value we engage in strategic acquisition and other transaction including joint venture and make investment which we believe are important to the future of our business with the goal of maximizing stockholder value from time to time we acquire business and other asset including patent technology wireless spectrum and other intangible asset enter into joint venture or other strategic transaction and purchase minority equity interest in or make loan to company including those that may be private and early stage our strategic activity are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunity for our product and technology and supporting the design and introduction of new product and service or enhancing existing product or service for voice and data communication and new industry segment many of our strategic activity entail high degree of risk and require the use of significant amount of capital and investment may not become liquid for several year after the date of the investment if at all our strategic activity may not generate financial return or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technology product or service we may underestimate the cost or overestimate the benefit including product revenue cost and other synergy and growth opportunity that we expect to realize and we may not achieve those benefit in some case we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or loss of company in which we have acquired ownership interest in addition we may record impairment charge related to our strategic activity any loss or impairment charge that we incur related to strategic activity will have negative impact on our financial condition and result of operation and we may continue to incur new or additional loss related to strategic asset or investment that we have not fully impaired or exited achieving the anticipated benefit of business acquisition including joint venture and other strategic investment in which we have management and operational control depends in part upon our ability to integrate the business in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergy and we may not be successful in these effort such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenge including among others retaining key employee successfully integrating new employee technology product process operation including manufacturing operation sale and distribution channel business model and business system retaining customer and supplier of the business consolidating research and development and supply operation minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business matter consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructure and managing the increased scale complexity and globalization of our business operation and employee base we may not derive any commercial value from associated technology or product or from future technology or product based on these technology and we may be subject to liability that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain and we may become subject to litigation additionally we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sale or distribution channel business or operational model including manufacturing geographic region industry segment or category of product served by or adjacent to the associated business or in addressing potential new opportunity that may arise out of the combination if we do not achieve the anticipated benefit of business acquisition or other strategic activity our business and result of operation may be adversely affected and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transaction many of our acquisition and other strategic investment require approval by the united state and or foreign government agency certain agency in the past have and may in the future deny the transaction or fail to approve in timely manner resulting in not realizing the anticipated benefit of the transaction future acquisition or other strategic investment may be more difficult complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisition ha been harmed further if china trade relation remain strained our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the state administration for market regulation samr in china may be severely impacted are subject to various law regulation policy and standard our business may suffer result of existing new or amended law regulation policy or standard or our failure or inability to comply with law regulation policy or standard our business product and service and those of our customer and licensee are subject to various law and regulation globally well government policy and the specification of international national and regional communication standard body compliance with existing law regulation policy and standard the adoption of new law regulation policy or standard change in the interpretation of existing law regulation policy or standard change in the regulation of our activity by government or standard body or ruling in court regulatory administrative or other proceeding relating to such law regulation policy or standard including among others those affecting licensing practice competitive business practice the use of our technology or product protection of intellectual property trade and trade protection including tariff cybersecurity foreign currency investment or loan spectrum availability and license issuance adoption of standard the provision of device subsidy by wireless operator to their customer taxation export control privacy and data protection environmental protection health and safety labor and employment human right corporate governance public disclosure or business conduct could have an adverse effect on our business and result of operation government policy particularly in china that regulate the amount and timing of fund that may flow out of country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of and or ability to receive payment from our customer and licensee in such country which may negatively impact our cash flow further china ha implemented and other country or region may implement cybersecurity law that require that our overall information technology security environment meet certain standard and or to be certified such law may be complex ambiguous and subject to interpretation which may create uncertainty regarding compliance result our effort to comply with such law may be expensive and may fail which could adversely affect our business result of operation and cash flow delay in government approval or other governmental activity that could result from among others decrease in or lack of funding for certain agency or branch of the government trade or national security protection policy or political change could result in our incurring higher cost could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transaction and could have other negative impact on our business and the business of our customer and licensee import export regulation such the export administration regulation administered by the department of commerce are complex change frequently have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current administration if our customer or supplier fail to comply with these regulation we may be required to suspend activity with these customer or supplier which could negatively impact our result of operation additionally we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with or to remedy violation of these regulation national state and local environmental law and regulation affect our operation around the world these law may make it more expensive to manufacture have manufactured and sell product and our cost could increase if our vendor supplier third party manufacturer or utility company pas on their cost to the imposition of tariff on raw material or our product could also have negative impact on our revenue and result of operation we are also subject to law and regulation impacting our manufacturing operation see the risk factor entitled there are numerous risk associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facility including higher portion of fixed cost relative to fable model environmental compliance and liability exposure to natural disaster timely supply of equipment and material and various manufacturing issue regulation in the united state require that we determine whether certain material used in our product referred to conflict mineral originated in the democratic republic of the congo or an adjoining country collectively the covered country or were from recycled or scrap source other country and region are imposing similar regulation which may require to undertake additional verification and reporting including regarding country in addition to the covered country and mineral in addition to conflict mineral the verification and reporting requirement in addition to customer demand for conflict free sourcing impose additional cost on and on our supplier and may limit the source or increase the price of material used in our product further if we are unable to determine that the conflict mineral used in our product do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed group in the covered country we may face challenge with our customer that place at competitive disadvantage and our reputation may be harmed similarly other law and regulation have been adopted or proposed that require additional transparency regarding the employment practice of our supplier and any failure to maintain responsible sourcing practice could also adversely affect our relationship with customer and our reputation regulation policy and standard are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance law regulation policy and standard are subject to varying interpretation in many case and their application in practice may evolve over time result our effort to comply may fail particularly if there is ambiguity to how they should be applied in practice failure to comply with any law regulation policy or standard may adversely affect our business result of operation and cash flow new law regulation policy and standard or evolving interpretation of legal requirement may cause to incur higher cost we revise current practice policy or procedure and may divert management time and attention to compliance activity our use of open source software may harm our business certain of our software and our supplier software may contain or may be derived from open source software and we have seen and believe we will continue to see an increase in customer requesting that we develop product including software associated with our integrated circuit product that incorporate open source software element and operate in an open source environment which under certain open source license may offer accessibility to portion of product source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing condition licensing of such software may impose certain obligation on if we were to distribute derivative work of the open source software for example these obligation may require to make source code for the derivative work available to our customer in manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customer or license such derivative work under particular type of license that is different than we customarily use to license our software furthermore in the course of product development we may make contribution to third party open source project that could obligate our intellectual property to adverse licensing condition for example to encourage the growth of software ecosystem that is interoperable with our product we may need to contribute certain implementation under the open source licensing term that govern such project which may adversely impact certain of our associated intellectual property developing open source product while adequately protecting the intellectual property right upon which our licensing business depends may prove burdensome and time consuming under certain circumstance thereby placing at competitive disadvantage and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property right also our use and our customer use of open source software may subject our product and our customer product to governmental scrutiny and delay in product certification which could cause customer to view our product le desirable than our competitor product while we believe we have taken appropriate step and employ adequate control to protect our intellectual property right our contribution to and use of open source software present risk that could have an adverse effect on these right and on our business we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry which is subject to significant downturn that may adversely impact our business our stock price earnings and the fair value of our investment are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuation due to this dynamic and others and to market downturn generally the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change price erosion evolving technical standard frequent new product introduction short product life cycle for both semiconductor and for many of the product in which they are used and fluctuation in product supply and demand from time to time these factor together with change in general economic condition cause significant upturn and downturn in the semiconductor industry period of downturn have been characterized by diminished demand for end user product high inventory level period of inventory adjustment underutilization of manufacturing capacity change in revenue mix and erosion of average selling price we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturn even when overall economic condition are relatively stable if we can not offset semiconductor industry or market downturn our revenue may decline and our financial condition and result of operation may be adversely impacted our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future factor that may have significant impact on the market price of our stock and earnings include those identified above and throughout this risk factor section volatility of the stock market in general and technology based and semiconductor company in particular announcement concerning our supplier our competitor or our customer or licensee and variation between our actual financial result or guidance and expectation of security analyst or investor among others further increased volatility in the financial market and overall economic condition may reduce the amount that we realize in the future on our cash equivalent and marketable security and may reduce our earnings result of any reduction in the fair value of marketable security in the past security class action litigation ha been brought against company following period of volatility in the market price of their security due to change in our stock price we are and may in the future be the target of security litigation security litigation could result in substantial uninsured cost and divert management attention and our resource certain legal matter including certain security litigation brought against are described more fully in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency are risk associated with our indebtedness and our significant stock repurchase program our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have negative consequence on our business including among others requiring to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purpose limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditure acquisition stock repurchase dividend or general corporate or other purpose limiting our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business our industry and the market and increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuation to the extent portion of our debt ha variable interest rate our ability to make payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance which is subject to economic and political condition industry cycle and financial business and other factor including factor which negatively impact our cash flow such licensee withholding some or all of the royalty payment they owe to or our paying fine or modifying our business practice in connection with regulatory investigation or litigation many of which are beyond our control if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operation in the future to service our debt we may be required to among other thing refinance or restructure all or portion of our indebtedness reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditure reduce or eliminate our dividend payment or sell selected asset such measure might not be sufficient to enable to service our debt in addition any such refinancing restructuring or sale of asset might not be available on economically favorable term or at all and if prevailing interest rate at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rate interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase if there are adverse change in the rating assigned to our debt security by credit rating agency our borrowing cost our ability to access debt in the future and the term of such debt could be adversely affected our current outstanding variable rate indebtedness us libor benchmark for establishing the interest rate libor is the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposal for reform these reform may cause libor to disappear entirely after or to perform differently than in the past we expect that reasonable alternative to libor will be created and implemented prior to the target date fallback provision are being written into libor based contract to attempt to reduce the risk of sudden and unpredictable increase in the cost of variable rate indebtedness however we can not predict the consequence and timing of these development we have implemented stock repurchase program to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding common stock this stock repurchase program ha significantly reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of cash that we have available to fund our operation including research and development working capital capital expenditure acquisition investment dividend and other corporate purpose and increase our exposure to adverse economic market industry and competitive condition and development and other change in our business and our industry in addition this significant decrease in our cash reserve exacerbates the risk described above associated with our indebtedness our business and operation could suffer in the event of security breach of our information technology system or other misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential information third party regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system and most of such attempt are increasingly more sophisticated these attempt which might be related to industrial or other espionage criminal hacker or state sponsored intrusion include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computer and network including those in our manufacturing operation and impersonating authorized user among others in addition third party supplier that we may rely on to store and or process our confidential information may also be subject to similar attack such attempt could result in the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of or our employee customer licensee supplier or other third party well damage to or disruption in our information technology system these threat are constantly evolving thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measure we seek to detect and investigate all security incident and to prevent their recurrence but attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology system may be successful and in some case we might be unaware of an incident or it magnitude and effect the misappropriation theft misuse disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property or the proprietary confidential or personal information of or our employee customer licensee supplier or other third party could harm our competitive position reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiative cause to lose business damage our reputation subject to legal or regulatory proceeding cause to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business we expect to continue to devote significant resource to the security of our information technology system addition employee and former employee in particular former employee who become employee of our competitor customer or licensee may misappropriate use publish or provide to our competitor customer licensee or other third party our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential business information this risk is exacerbated competitor for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire our employee see the risk factor entitled we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee similarly we provide access to certain of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential business information to our direct and indirect customer and licensee and certain of our consultant who may wrongfully use such intellectual property or information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property or information to third party including our competitor potential tax liability could adversely affect our result of operation we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax we regularly are subject to examination of our tax return and report by taxing authority in the united state federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdiction most notably in country where we earn routine return and the tax authority believe substantial value add activity are performed our current examination are at various stage with respect to assessment claim deficiency and refund we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact giving rise to revision become known although we believe that our tax estimate are reasonable the final determination of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our historical income tax provision and accrual in such case our income tax provision result of operation and cash flow in the period or period in which that determination is made could be negatively affected the united state treasury department ha issued proposed regulation on several provision of the tax legislation including foreign tax credit fdii beat and interest expense deduction limitation which are expected to be finalized in the next several month when finalized these proposed regulation may adversely affect our provision for income tax result of operation and or cash flow we have tax incentive in singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criterion and result of the expiration of these incentive our singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal and again in fiscal if we do not meet the criterion required to retain such incentive our singapore tax rate could increase prior to fiscal and our result of operation and cash flow could be adversely affected tax rule may change in manner that adversely affect our future reported result of operation or the way we conduct our business further change in the tax law of foreign jurisdiction could arise result of the base erosion and profit shifting beps project that wa undertaken by the organization for economic co operation and development oecd the oecd which represents coalition of member country recommended change to numerous long standing tax principle related to transfer pricing these change adopted by country may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income tax result of operation and cash flow partially to address beps we moved certain ip from singapore to the united state result if tax rate were to increase in the united state our result of operation cash flow and financial condition could be adversely affected global regional or local economic condition or political action including trade and or national security protection policy such tariff that impact the mobile communication industry or the other industry in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our product and service and our customer or licensee product and service which may negatively affect our revenue decline in global regional or local economic condition slow down in economic growth political action including trade and or national security protection policy such tariff or action by government that limit or prevent from transacting business with certain company or that limit or prevent certain company from transacting business with particularly in geographic region with high concentration of wireless voice and data user or high concentration of our customer or licensee could have adverse wide ranging effect on demand for our product and service and for the product and service of our customer or licensee particularly equipment manufacturer or others in the wireless communication industry who buy their product such wireless operator any prolonged economic downturn or trade war may result in decrease in demand for our product and technology decrease in demand for the product of our customer or licensee the insolvency of key supplier customer or licensee delay in reporting or payment from our licensee or customer failure by counterparties and negative effect on wireless device inventory in addition our customer ability to purchase or pay for our product and service and network operator ability to upgrade their wireless network could be adversely affected by economic condition leading to reduction cancelation or delay of order for our product and service may not be able to attract and retain qualified employee our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officer and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify attract retain and motivate them implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent our revenue are highly dependent on technological and product innovation the market for employee in our industry is extremely competitive and competitor for talent particularly engineering talent increasingly attempt to hire and to varying degree have been successful in hiring our employee including by establishing local office near our headquarters in san diego california number of such competitor for talent are significantly larger than and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer further existing immigration law make it more difficult for to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduate of university in the united state making the pool of available talent even smaller if we are unable to attract and retain qualified employee our business may be harmed currency fluctuation could negatively affect future product sale or royalty revenue harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the dollar cost of our product our customer sell their product throughout the world in various currency our consolidated revenue from international customer and licensee accounted for significant portion of our total revenue in each of the last three fiscal year adverse movement in currency exchange rate may negatively affect our business revenue result of operation and cash flow due to number of factor including among others our product and those of our customer and licensee that are sold outside the united state may become le price competitive which may result in reduced demand for those product or downward pressure on average selling price certain of our revenue that are derived from product that are sold in foreign currency could decrease resulting in lower revenue cash flow and margin certain of our revenue such royalty that are derived from licensee or customer sale denominated in foreign currency could decrease resulting in lower revenue and cash flow our foreign supplier may raise their price if they are impacted by currency fluctuation resulting in higher than expected cost and lower margin and cash flow certain of our cost that are denominated in foreign currency could increase resulting in higher than expected cost and cash outflow and foreign exchange hedging expose to counterparty risk and may require the payment of structuring fee if the foreign exchange hedge do not qualify for hedge accounting the hedge result may cause earnings volatility the foreign exchange hedging activity are designed to lessen earnings volatility therefore hedge may reduce the impact of currency fluctuation to certain revenue and cost failure in our product or service or in the product or service of our customer or licensee including those resulting from security vulnerability defect or error could harm our business the use of device containing our product to interact with untrusted system or otherwise access untrusted content creates risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those device to malicious attack while we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measure to safeguard our product from cybersecurity threat device capability continue to evolve enabling more elaborate functionality and application and increasing the risk of security failure further our product are inherently complex and may contain defect or error that are detected only when the product are in use development of product and feature in new domain of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technology with smaller geometric feature size are complex add risk to manufacturing yield and reliability and increase the likelihood of product defect or error because our product and service are responsible for critical function in our customer product and network security failure defect or error in our product or service could have an adverse impact on on our customer and the end user of our customer product such adverse impact could include shipment delay write offs of our inventory property plant and equipment and intangible asset unfavorable purchase commitment shift of business to our competitor decrease in demand for connected device and wireless service damage to our reputation and our customer relationship regulatory action and other financial liability or harm to our business in addition security failure defect or error in the product of our customer or licensee could have an adverse impact on our result of operation and cash flow due to delay or decrease in demand for our product or service generally and our premium tier product in particular among other factor further failure defect or error in our product or those of our customer or licensee entail the risk of product liability claim or recall unresolved staff commentsnone item propertiesat september we occupied the following facility square

approximately idc mobile phone tracker primarily driven by further lengthening of replacement cycle particularly in developed region and china where consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle the industry transition to qct result in fiscal were negatively impacted by lower modem sale to apple in april we entered into settlement agreement with apple and it contract manufacturer to dismiss all outstanding litigation between the party we also entered into six year global patent license agreement with apple effective of april which includes an option for apple to extend for two additional year and multi year chipset supply agreement with apple in the third quarter of fiscal we recognized licensing revenue of billion resulting from the settlement consisting of payment from apple and the release of certain of our obligation to pay apple and it contract manufacturer customer related liability in addition our qtl result for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal included royalty from apple and it contract manufacturer for sale made in such quarter qtl result in fiscal reflected certain reduction made in the per unit royalty cap which provide maximum royalty amount payable per device in fiscal and while we expect these change to enhance stability for the long term they negatively impacted qtl royalty revenue in fiscal in addition an increasing number of new and existing licensee have elected to enter into worldwide license agreement covering only our cellular standard essential patent resulting in lower qtl royalty revenue in fiscal qtl revenue in fiscal included million paid under second interim agreement with huawei that concluded in the third quarter of fiscal and although negotiation continue we have not

million charge to other expense in the third quarter of fiscal in october we filed an appeal of the ec decision and we provided financial guarantee to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment while we appeal the ec decision in the second quarter of fiscal we announced cost plan designed to align our cost structure to our long term margin target part of this plan we initiated series of targeted action across our business with the objective to reduce annual cost by billion excluding incremental cost resulting from any future acquisition of business action taken under this plan have been completed and resulted in achieving substantially all of this target in fiscal based on our run rate exiting the second quarter of fiscal excluding litigation cost that were in excess of the

program have significantly reduced the amount of our cash cash equivalent and marketable security resulting in decrease to interest and dividend income in fiscal the increase in net gain on marketable security in fiscal wa primarily driven by gain resulting from the initial public offering of certain non marketable equity investment the increase in interest expense in fiscal wa primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of billion of unsecured floating and fixed rate note in may of which billion were repaid between may and august in the first quarter of fiscal we began divesting substantial portion of our marketable security portfolio in order to finance in part the then proposed acquisition of nxp result we recorded net realized gain and impairment loss on such

meaningful following table summarizes the primary factor that caused our annual tax provision to differ from the expected income tax provision at the united state federal statutory rate in million income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate income tax provision net of federal of deferred tax asset on distributed intellectual benefit from establishing new net deferred tax asset benefit from foreign derived intangible income fdii deduction benefit related to the research and development tax credit benefit from foreign income taxed at other than rate nondeductible charge reversal related to the ec kftc and tftc of change in tax reserve and audit settlement for prior year tax on undistributed foreign toll charge from tax reform valuation allowance on deferred tax asset related to nxp termination fee remeasurement of deferred tax due to change in statutory rate due to tax reform tax expense tax cut and job act the tax legislation which wa enacted during the first quarter of fiscal significantly revised the united state corporate income tax by among other thing lowering the corporate income tax rate to and imposing one time repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profit of owned foreign subsidiary the toll charge the tax legislation fundamentally changed the taxation of multinational entity including shift from system of worldwide taxation with deferral to hybrid territorial system featuring participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income minimum tax on low taxed foreign earnings and new measure to deter base erosion and promote production fiscal year taxpayer certain provision of the tax legislation became effective starting at the beginning of fiscal including gilti global intangible low taxed income new tax on income of foreign corporation beat base erosion and anti abuse tax and fdii foreign derived intangible income in response to the tax legislation and to better align our profit with our activity we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal and result beginning in fiscal substantially all of our income is in the of which significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment fdii at effective tax rate the impact of gilti and beat is negligible accordingly our annual effective tax rate for fiscal reflected the effect of these provision of the tax legislation our annual effective tax rate for fiscal reflected blended federal statutory rate of approximately result of the tax legislation in fiscal several of our foreign subsidiary made tax election to be treated branch for federal income tax purpose commonly referred to check the box election effective beginning in fiscal and result of making these check the box election we recorded tax benefit of million in fiscal additionally in fiscal the united state treasury department issued new temporary regulation that resulted in change to the deductibility of dividend income received by stockholder from foreign corporation result of this change pursuant to an agreement with the internal revenue service we relinquished the federal tax basis step up of intellectual property that wa distributed in fiscal by one of our foreign subsidiary to subsidiary therefore the related deferred tax asset wa derecognized resulting in billion charge to income tax expense in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal also reflected benefit from our fdii deduction including the impact of the apple settlement and research and development credit well the impact of the ec fine which is not deductible for tax purpose in fiscal result of the tax legislation we recorded charge of billion to income tax expense comprised of billion related to the estimated toll charge and million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax asset and liability that existed at the end of fiscal at lower enacted corporate income tax rate which included million tax benefit in fiscal related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liability that wa established result of change in one of our position due to the tax legislation tax expense for fiscal wa also impacted by the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to the termination fee paid to nxp which did not result in tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss fiscal and income tax expense wa impacted by the ec kftc and tftc fine and settlement with the tftc which were not deductible for tax purpose or taxable in the case of the settlement and portion of which were attributable to foreign jurisdiction and to the united state these impact were partially offset in fiscal and by lower revenue primarily related to decreased royalty revenue from apple contract manufacturer and for fiscal payment to blackberry in connection with an arbitration decision income tax expense for fiscal also reflected the increase in our singapore tax rate result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentive in march which wa substantially offset by tax benefit resulting from the increase in our singapore tax rate in effect when certain deferred tax asset reversed during the third quarter of fiscal we entered into new tax incentive agreement in singapore that result in reduced tax rate from march through march provided that we meet specified employment and investment criterion in singapore our singapore tax rate will increase in march result of expiration of these incentive and again in march upon the expiration of tax incentive under prior agreement without these tax incentive our fiscal income tax expense would have been higher during fiscal one of our singapore subsidiary distributed certain intellectual property to subsidiary substantially reducing the benefit of these tax incentive going forward unrecognized tax benefit were billion and million at september and september respectively the increase in unrecognized tax benefit in fiscal wa primarily due to our plan to apply for refund of korean withholding tax which had an insignificant impact to our income tax provision result of recent court ruling in korea among other factor if successful the refund will result in corresponding reduction in foreign tax credit we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and are currently under examination by various tax authority worldwide primarily related to transfer pricing these examination are at various stage with respect to assessment claim deficiency and refund we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact give rise to revision become known of september we believe that adequate amount have been reserved for based on fact known however the final determination of tax audit and any related legal proceeding could materially differ from amount reflected in our income tax provision and the related accrual segment resultsthe following should

smartphones by industry segment outside traditional cellular industry such automotive computing iot and networking we look forward to the next several month and beyond we expect our business to be impacted by the following key item in may in united state federal trade commission ftc qualcomm incorporated the court issued an order ruling against and imposing certain injunctive relief we disagree with the court conclusion interpretation of the fact and application of the law accordingly we filed motion to stay certain of the remedy with and have appealed the decision to the ninth circuit court of appeal ninth circuit in august our partial motion to stay wa granted in it entirety by the ninth circuit regulatory authority in certain jurisdiction have investigated our business practice and instituted proceeding against and they or other regulatory authority may do so in the future additionally certain of our direct and indirect customer and licensee have pursued and others may in the future pursue litigation or arbitration against related to our business unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matter have had and could in the future have material adverse effect on our business revenue result of operation financial condition and cash flow depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable these activity have required and we expect that they will continue to require the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted and we expect that they will continue to result in increased legal cost until the respective matter are resolved see note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency and part item risk factor included in this annual report including the risk factor entitled effort by some communication equipment manufacturer or their customer to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalty for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resource and may result in legal decision or action by government court regulator or agency standard development organization sdos or other industry organization that harm our business our business particularly our licensing business may suffer result of adverse ruling in government investigation or proceeding and change in our patent licensing practice whether due to governmental investigation or private legal proceeding challenging those practice or otherwise could adversely impact our business and result of operation in fiscal we entered into second interim agreement with huawei under which we recognized million of royalty revenue in fiscal these payment do not reflect the full amount of royalty due under the underlying license agreement the second interim agreement concluded in the third quarter of fiscal and although negotiation continue we have not reached final agreement with huawei we did not record any revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal for royalty due on the sale of huawei product if no agreement is reached huawei may not make any other payment or may not make full payment due under the underlying license agreement which may result in significant legal cost and will negatively impact our future revenue well our financial condition result of operation and cash flow until the dispute is resolved we expect our business particularly qct to continue to be impacted by industry dynamic including increased concentration of device share among few company particularly within the premium tier resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those company and exacerbating the negative impact to our business and financial result to the extent those company do not utilize our chipsets for example huawei ha taken and we believe will continue to take share in china from other chinese oems negatively impacting qct we sell limited number of chipsets to huawei compared to many of those other oems and the negative impact to our overall business of huawei share gain at the expense of other chinese oems may be further exacerbated if huawei continues to not pay royalty or doe not make full payment due to under it license agreement decision by company to utilize their own internally developed integrated circuit product and or sell such product to others including by selling them together with certain of their other product decision by certain company to utilize our competitor integrated circuit product in all or portion of their device for example we have not been the sole supplier of modem for iphone product beginning product that launched in september apple utilizes modem from one of our competitor in portion of such device apple is solely using one of our competitor modem rather than our modem in it iphone release for new chipset model qct doe not expect to begin recording revenue under our recently announced multi year chipset agreement with apple until the second half of fiscal intense competition particularly in china our competitor expand their product offering and or reduce the price of their product part of strategy to attract new and or retain existing customer slow down in handset demand the industry transition from to and continued reduction in demand in developed region and china lengthened handset replacement cycle and consumer demand which is increasingly driven by new product launch and or innovation cycle and continued growth of device share by chinese oems in china and in region outside of china current china trade relation and or national security protection policy may negatively impact our business growth prospect and result of operation initial commercial network deployment and device launch have begun and will continue into fiscal and beyond we believe that technology will empower new era of smartphones and connected device we also believe that will drive transformation across industry beyond traditional cellular communication that will create new business model and new service we believe it is important that we remain leader in technology development standardization intellectual property creation and licensing of technology and to be leading developer and supplier of integrated circuit product in order to sustain and grow our business long term we continue to invest significant resource to develop our wireless baseband chipsets and our converged computing communication snapdragon chipsets which incorporate technology in the following area among others advancement in and ofdm based wi fi rf connectivity power management graphic audio and video codecs multimedia artificial intelligence and virtual augmented reality and all of which contribute to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio we are also investing in targeted opportunity that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business model and enter and or expand into new industry segment and application such product for automotive computing iot including the connected home smart city wearable voice and music and robotics and networking among others in addition to the foregoing business and market based matter we continue to devote resource

other noncurrent liability have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authority information regarding our financial commitment at september is provided in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note income tax note debt and note commitment and contingency critical accounting estimatesthe preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base our estimate on historical and anticipated result and trend and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance including assumption to future event by their nature estimate are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty although we believe that our estimate and the assumption supporting our assessment are reasonable actual result that differ from our estimate could be material to our consolidated financial statement summary of our significant accounting policy is included in this annual report in note to consolidated financial statement note significant accounting policy we consider the following accounting estimate to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statement revenue recognition we derive revenue principally from sale of integrated circuit product and licensing of our intellectual property we grant license or otherwise provide right to use portion of our intellectual property portfolio which among other right includes certain patent right essential to and or useful in the manufacture sale or use of certain wireless product licensee pay royalty based on their sale of product incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay fixed license fee in one or more installment sale based royalty are generally based upon percentage of the wholesale licensee selling price of complete licensed product net of certain permissible deduction including transportation insurance packing cost and other item we broadly provide per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet laptop and smartwatches and provide for maximum royalty amount payable per device we estimate and recognize sale based royalty on such licensed product in the period in which the associated sale occur subject to certain constraint on our ability to estimate such royalty our estimate of sale based royalty are based largely on an assessment of the volume of device supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property we estimate sale based royalty taking into consideration the mix of such sale on licensee by licensee basis well the licensee average wholesale price of such product and consider all information historical current and forecasted which may include certain estimate from licensee that is reasonably available to we also consider in our estimate of sale based royalty any change in pricing we plan or expect to make our licensee however do not report and pay royalty owed for sale in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter which is generally the following quarter result of recognizing revenue in the period in which the licensee sale occur using estimate adjustment to revenue are required in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate new information becomes available primarily resulting from actual amount reported by our licensee from time to time regulatory authority investigate our business practice particularly with respect to our licensing business and institute proceeding against depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable additionally from time to time company initiate various strategy in an attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property which may include disputing underreporting underpaying not reporting and or not paying royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reporting to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation in such case we estimate and recognize licensing revenue only when we have contract defined in the revenue recognition guidance and to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur both of which may require significant judgment we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of estimated revenue recognized in order to mitigate this risk which may result in recognizing revenue le than amount contractually owed to in may in united state federal trade commission ftc qualcomm incorporated the court issued an order ruling against and imposing certain injunctive relief see note to consolidated financial statement note commitment and contingency in august the court of appeal for the ninth circuit granted in it entirety qualcomm request for partial stay of the injunction while we believe that our business practice do not violate either antitrust law or our frand fair reasonable and non discriminatory licensing commitment significant evaluation and judgment were required in determining the impact of such ruling on the amount of licensing revenue estimated and in fiscal this included among other item evaluating whether our license agreement remain valid and enforceable ii evaluating licensee conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligation and iii determining the expected impact if any to revenue of any license agreement that may be renegotiated and or are newly entered into based on this evaluation the impact of the ruling wa not material to qtl licensing revenue in fiscal based on fact and factor currently known by new information becomes available we may be required to make adjustment to revenue in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate and or this matter could have material adverse effect on our ability to recognize future licensing revenue impairment of other investment we hold investment in non marketable equity instrument in privately held company including those accounted for under the equity method non marketable equity instrument do not have readily determinable fair value and are accounted for under the equity method or based on initial cost minus impairment if any plus or minus adjustment resulting from observable price change in orderly transaction for identical or similar security many of these investment are in early stage company which are inherently risky because the market for the technology or product of these company are uncertain and may never develop we monitor our investment for event or circumstance that could indicate the investment are impaired such deterioration in the investee financial condition and business forecast and lower valuation in recently completed or anticipated financing and we record impairment loss in earnings when we believe an investment ha experienced decline in value such decline in value must be considered other than temporary for equity method investment valuation of inventory inventory are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first in first out method recoverability of inventory is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factor including committed purchase order from customer well purchase commitment projection provided by customer among other thing this valuation also requires to make judgment and assumption based on information currently available about market condition including competition product pricing product life cycle and development plan we move to smaller geometry process technology the manufacturing lead time increase resulting in an increased reliance on our own forecast of customer demand rather than our customer forecast if we overestimate demand for our product the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchase from our supplier our assumption of future product demand are inherently uncertain and change in our estimate and assumption may cause to realize material write down in the future valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived and long lived asset our business combination typically result in the recording of goodwill other intangible asset and or property plant and equipment and the recorded value of those asset may become impaired in the future we also acquire intangible asset and property plant and equipment in other type of transaction the determination of the recorded value of intangible asset acquired in business combination requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect our consolidated financial statement for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumption that require significant judgment for example the income approach generally requires to use assumption to estimate future cash flow including those related to total addressable market pricing and share forecast competition technology obsolescence future tax rate and discount rate our estimate of the fair value of certain asset may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumption or utilize different business model and from the future cash flow actually realized goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment and in interim period if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicator and future cash flow related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset may be based on operational performance of our business market condition expected selling price and or other factor although there are inherent uncertainty in this assessment process the estimate and assumption we use including estimate of future cash flow and discount rate are consistent with our internal planning when appropriate if these estimate or their related assumption change in the future we may be required to record an impairment charge on portion or all of our goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and or long lived asset furthermore we can not predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering event nor the impact such event might have on our reported asset value future event could cause to conclude that impairment indicator exist and that goodwill or other long lived asset associated with our acquired business are impaired any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our condition and result of operation during fiscal and we recorded million million and million respectively in impairment charge for goodwill other indefinite lived intangible asset and long lived asset the estimated fair value of our qct and qtl reporting unit were substantially in excess of their respective carrying value at september legal and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding and we intend to continue to vigorously defend litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular investigation by antitrust and trade regulation agency are not conducted in consistent manner across jurisdiction further each country and agency ha different set of law rule and regulation both substantive and procedural well different legal principle theory and potential remedy and some agency may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goal depending on the jurisdiction these investigation can involve non transparent procedure under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theory or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency unlike in civil litigation in the united state in foreign proceeding we may not be entitled to discovery or deposition allowed to cross examine witness or confront our accuser result we may not be aware of and may not be entitled to know all allegation against or the information or document provided to or discovered or prepared by the agency accordingly we may have little or no idea what an agency intent is with respect to liability penalty or the timing of decision in many case the agency are given significant discretion and any available precedent may have limited if any predictive value in their jurisdiction much le in other jurisdiction accordingly we can not predict the outcome of these matter however the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceeding could have material adverse effect on our business result of operation financial condition and or cash flow broad range of remedy with respect to our business practice that are deemed to violate applicable law are potentially available these remedy may include among others injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money and the issuance of order to cease certain conduct and or to modify our business practice if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceeding we disclose such fact and if reasonably estimable we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination to whether loss is reasonably estimable revision in our estimate of the potential liability could materially impact our result of operation income tax we are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction and the assessment of our income tax position involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax law and regulation in various taxing jurisdiction in addition the application of tax law and regulation is subject to legal and factual interpretation judgment and uncertainty tax law and regulation themselves are subject to change result of change in fiscal policy change in legislation the evolution of regulation and court ruling significant judgment and estimate are required in determining our provision for income tax including those related to special deduction such fdii foreign derived intangible income tax incentive intercompany research and development cost sharing arrangement transfer pricing tax credit and the realizability of deferred tax asset while we believe we have appropriate support for the position we have taken or that we plan to take on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by taxing authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax therefore the actual liability for or foreign tax may be materially different from our estimate which could result in the need to record additional tax liability or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liability we are participating in the internal revenue service irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issue prior to filing our federal return benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustment by the irs are le likely to occur recent accounting pronouncementsinformation regarding

change in the general level of interest rate can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio if interest rate in the general economy were to rise our holding could lose value result of divesting substantial portion of our marketable security portfolio and change in portfolio allocation the fair value of our investment portfolio is subject to lower interest rate risk at september and september hypothetical increase in interest rate of basis point across the entire yield curve on our holding would have resulted in negligible decrease in the fair value of our holding other investmentsequity price risk we hold investment in non marketable equity instrument in privately held company that may be impacted by equity price risk volatility in the equity market could negatively affect our

conclusion of the quarter in which the licensee sale occurred and when all other revenue recognition criterion had been met under the new accounting guidance we estimate and recognize sale based royalty in the period in which the associated sale occur subject to certain constraint on our ability to estimate such amount resulting in an acceleration of revenue recognition compared to the historical method under asc since we do not invoice for sale based royalty estimated and recognized in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter which is generally the following quarter when such royalty are reported by licensee revenue recognized from sale based royalty result in unbilled receivables included in account receivable net on the consolidated balance sheet the adoption of asc did not otherwise have material impact the new accounting guidance also impact the timing of recognizing certain customer incentive which are recorded reduction to revenue in the

operation additionally it change the disclosure requirement for financial instrument we adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal using the modified retrospective transition method for investment in marketable security which have readily determinable fair value with the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting guidance recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings upon adoption we reclassified million of unrealized gain net of the associated tax effect related to our investment in marketable security from accumulated other comprehensive income to opening retained earnings we have applied the prospective transition method for investment in non marketable security which are investment in privately held company that do not have readily determinable fair value and will recognize through earnings any unrealized gain that have accumulated in the period in which there is an observable transaction if any prior to the adoption of the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal investment in marketable equity security were generally classified available for sale equity investment with net unrealized gain or loss recorded

the classification of certain cash receipt and cash payment in the statement of cash flow we adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal using the retrospective transition method for each period presented which did not have material impact on our consolidated statement of cash flow in november the fasb issued new accounting guidance that requires company to include restricted cash and cash equivalent component in total cash and cash equivalent on the statement of cash flow result the consolidated statement of cash flow no longer reflects transfer between cash and cash equivalent and restricted cash and cash equivalent we adopted the new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal using the retrospective transition method which resulted in certain amount in fiscal and being adjusted to conform to the new accounting guidance in fiscal billion wa designated collateral for outstanding letter of credit in connection with the then proposed acquisition of nxp semiconductor nxp during fiscal billion of the amount held collateral wa invested in time deposit that were not considered cash equivalent which subsequently matured this resulted in an adjustment to investing activity for fiscal to reflect the billion purchase and subsequent maturity of time deposit and billion reduction in investing activity to reflect removal of the activity of restricted cash and cash equivalent in fiscal such restricted cash and cash equivalent were released from restriction which resulted in decrease in investing activity by such amount income tax in october the fasb issued new accounting guidance that change the accounting for the income tax effect of intra entity transfer of asset other than inventory under the new accounting guidance the selling transferring entity is required to recognize current tax expense or benefit upon transfer of the asset similarly the purchasing receiving entity is required to recognize deferred tax asset or

transition method with the cumulative effect of applying the new accounting guidance recognized an adjustment to opening retained earnings of billion primarily the result of establishing deferred tax asset on the basis difference of certain intellectual property distributed from one of our foreign subsidiary to subsidiary in the united state in fiscal during fiscal the united state treasury department issued new temporary regulation that resulted in change to the deductibility of dividend income received by stockholder from foreign corporation result of this change pursuant to an agreement with the internal revenue service we relinquished the federal tax basis step up in such distributed intellectual property therefore the related deferred tax asset wa derecognized resulting

to determine whether the unrealized loss is other than temporary we consider factor including the significance of the decline in value compared to the cost basis underlying factor contributing to decline in the price of security in single asset class how long the market value of the security ha been le than it cost basis the security relative performance versus it peer sector or asset class the market and economy in general view of external investment manager news or financial information that ha been released specific to the investee and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates if debt security market value is below amortized cost and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before it anticipated recovery we record an other than temporary impairment charge to investment and other income net for the entire amount of the impairment for the remaining debt security if an other than temporary impairment exists we separate the other than temporary impairment into the portion of the loss related to credit factor or the credit loss portion which is recorded charge to investment and

value is defined the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participant of the measurement date applicable accounting guidance provides an established hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable input and minimizes the use of unobservable input by requiring that the most observable input be used when available observable input are input that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from source independent of unobservable input are input that reflect our assumption about the factor that market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability there are three level of input that may be used to measure fair value level includes financial instrument for which quoted market price for identical instrument are available in active market level includes financial instrument for which there are input other than quoted price included within level that are observable for the instrument incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statement level includes financial instrument for which fair value is derived from valuation technique in which one or more significant input are

fair value hierarchy classification on quarterly basis change in the observability of valuation input may result in reclassification of level for certain security within the fair value hierarchy we recognize transfer into and out of level within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal month in which the actual event or change in circumstance that caused the transfer to occur cash equivalent and marketable security with the exception of auction rate security we obtain pricing information from quoted market price pricing vendor or quote from broker dealer we conduct review of our primary pricing vendor to determine whether the input used in the vendor pricing process are deemed to be observable the fair value for interest bearing security includes accrued interest the fair value of corporate bond and note and common and preferred stock is generally determined using standard observable input including reported trade quoted market price matrix pricing benchmark yield

improvement are depreciated over year leasehold improvement and building on leased land are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful life not to exceed year and year respectively or the remaining term of the related lease other property plant and equipment have useful life ranging from to year leased property meeting certain capital lease criterion is capitalized and the net present

value for intangible asset acquired in non monetary exchange the estimated fair value of the asset transferred or the estimated fair value of the asset received if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded value unless the value of neither the asset received nor the asset transferred are determinable within reasonable limit in which case the asset received are measured based on the carrying value of the asset transferred valuation technique consistent with the market approach income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value impairment of goodwill other indefinite lived asset and long lived asset goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset are tested annually for impairment in the fourth fiscal quarter and in interim period if event or change in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired if qualitative assessment is used and we determine that the fair value of reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not likelihood of more than le than it carrying amount quantitative impairment test will be performed if goodwill is quantitatively assessed for impairment and reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value the difference is recorded an impairment other indefinite lived intangible asset are quantitatively assessed for impairment if necessary by comparing their estimated fair value to their carrying value if the carrying value exceeds the fair value the difference is recorded an impairment long lived asset such property plant and equipment and intangible asset subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable recoverability of asset to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to be generated by the asset or asset group if the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds it estimated future cash flow an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group long lived asset to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value le cost to sell and are not depreciated revenue recognition result of the adoption of asc we revised our revenue recognition policy beginning in fiscal follows we derive revenue principally from sale of integrated circuit product and licensing of our intellectual property we also generate revenue from licensing system software and by performing development and other service and from other product sale the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon variety of factor including the specific term of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligation revenue from sale of our product are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment revenue from providing service are typically recognized over time our performance obligation is satisfied revenue from providing service and licensing system software were each le than of total revenue for all period presented we grant license or otherwise provide right to use portion of our intellectual property portfolio which among other right includes certain patent right essential to and or useful in the manufacture sale or use of certain wireless product licensee pay royalty based on their sale of product incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay fixed license fee in one or more installment sale based royalty are generally based upon percentage of the wholesale licensee selling price of complete licensed product net of certain permissible deduction including transportation insurance packing cost and other item we broadly provide per unit royalty cap that apply to certain category of complete wireless device namely smartphones tablet laptop and smartwatches and provide for maximum royalty amount payable per device we estimate and recognize sale based royalty on such licensed product in the period in which the associated sale occur subject to certain constraint on our ability to estimate such royalty our estimate of sale based royalty are based largely on an assessment of the volume of device supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property we estimate sale based royalty taking into consideration the mix of such sale on licensee by licensee basis well the licensee average wholesale price of such product and consider all information historical current and forecasted which may include certain estimate from licensee that is reasonably available to we also consider in our estimate of sale based royalty any change in pricing we plan or expect to make our licensee however do not report and pay royalty owed for sale in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter which is generally the following quarter result of recognizing revenue in the period in which the licensee sale occur using incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsestimates adjustment to revenue are required in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate new information becomes available primarily resulting from actual amount reported by our licensee license agreement that require payment of license fee contain single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreement provide the licensee the right to access portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to update and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated since we expect to expend effort to develop and transfer update to our licensed portfolio on an even basis license fee are recognized revenue on straight line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee we account for contract with customer licensee when it is legally enforceable the party are committed to perform their respective obligation the right of the party regarding the good and or service to be transferred are identified payment term are identified the contract ha commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable if all such condition are not met revenue and any associated receivables are generally not recognized until such time that the required condition are met cash collected from customer prior to contract existing is recorded to other customer related liability in other current liability from time to time regulatory authority investigate our business practice particularly with respect to our licensing business and institute proceeding against depending on the matter various remedy that could result from an unfavorable resolution include among others the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patent injunction monetary damage or fine or other order to pay money the issuance of order to cease certain conduct or modify our business practice such requiring to reduce our royalty rate reduce the base on which our royalty are calculated grant patent license to chipset manufacturer sell chipsets to unlicensed original equipment manufacturer oems or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreement and determination that some or all of our license agreement are invalid or unenforceable additionally from time to time company initiate various strategy in an attempt to negotiate renegotiate reduce and or eliminate their need to pay royalty to for the use of our intellectual property which may include disputing underreporting underpaying not reporting and or not paying royalty owed to under their license agreement with or reporting to in manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligation in such case we estimate and recognize licensing revenue only when we have contract defined in the revenue recognition guidance and to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur both of which may require significant judgment we analyze the risk of significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of estimated revenue recognized in order to mitigate this risk which may result in recognizing revenue le than amount contractually owed to in may in united state federal trade commission ftc qualcomm incorporated the court issued an order ruling against and imposing certain injunctive relief note in august the court of appeal for the ninth circuit granted in it entirety qualcomm request for partial stay of the injunction while we believe that our business practice do not violate either antitrust law or our frand fair reasonable and non discriminatory licensing commitment significant evaluation and judgment were required in determining the impact of such ruling on the amount of licensing revenue estimated and recognized in fiscal this included among other item evaluating whether our license agreement remain valid and enforceable ii evaluating licensee conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligation and iii determining the expected impact if any to revenue of any license agreement that may be renegotiated and or are newly entered into based on this evaluation the impact of the ruling wa not material to qtl licensing revenue in fiscal based on fact and factor currently known by new information becomes available we may be required to make adjustment to revenue in subsequent period to reflect change in estimate and or this matter could have material adverse effect on our ability to recognize future licensing revenue we measure revenue including our estimate of sale based royalty based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for product or service we record reduction to revenue for customer incentive arrangement including volume related and other pricing rebate and cost reimbursement for marketing and other activity involving certain of our product and technology in the period that the related revenue are earned the charge for such arrangement are recorded reduction to account receivable net or other current liability based on whether we have the intent and contractual right of offset certain of these charge are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price

quarter of fiscal we rely on sole or limited source supplier for some product particularly product in the qct segment subjecting to possible shortage of raw material or manufacturing capacity while we have established alternate supplier for certain technology that we consider critical the loss of supplier or the inability of supplier to meet performance or quality specification or delivery schedule could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligation and or negatively impact our revenue business operation and ability to compete for future business shipping and handling cost cost incurred for

share based award that are expected to be forfeited legal and regulatory proceeding we are currently involved in certain legal and regulatory proceeding litigation and investigation are inherently uncertain and we face difficulty in evaluating or estimating likely outcome or range of possible loss in antitrust and trade regulation investigation in particular investigation by antitrust and trade regulation agency are not conducted in consistent manner across jurisdiction further each country and agency ha different set of law rule and regulation both substantive and procedural well different legal principle theory and potential remedy and some agency may seek to use the investigation to advance domestic policy goal depending on the jurisdiction these investigation can involve non transparent procedure under which we may not receive access to evidence relied upon by the enforcement agency or that may be exculpatory and may not be informed of the specific legal theory or evidence considered or relied upon by the agency unlike in civil litigation in the united state in foreign proceeding we may not be entitled to discovery or deposition allowed to cross examine witness or confront our accuser result we incorporatednotes to consolidated financial statementsmay not be aware of and may not be entitled to know all allegation against or the information or document provided to or discovered or prepared by the agency accordingly we may have little or no idea what an agency intent is with respect to liability penalty or the timing of decision in many case the agency are given significant discretion and any available precedent may have limited if any predictive value in their jurisdiction much le in other jurisdiction accordingly we can not predict the outcome of these matter if there is at least reasonable possibility that material loss may have been incurred associated with pending legal and regulatory proceeding we disclose such fact and if reasonably estimable we provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of possible loss we record our best estimate of loss related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated where range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range we record the minimum estimated liability additional information becomes available we ass the potential liability related to pending legal and regulatory proceeding and revise our estimate and update our disclosure accordingly our legal cost associated

that is more likely than not to be realized we include interest and penalty related to income tax including unrecognized tax benefit within income tax expense we classify all deferred tax asset and liability noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet our income tax return are based on calculation and assumption that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authority in addition the calculation of our tax liability involves dealing with uncertainty in the application of complex tax regulation we recognize liability for uncertain tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step is to measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement while we believe we have appropriate support for the position taken on our tax return we regularly ass the potential outcome of examination by tax authority in determining the adequacy of our provision for income tax we continually ass the likelihood and amount of potential adjustment and adjust the income tax provision income tax payable and deferred tax in the period in which the fact that give rise to revision become known we recognize excess tax benefit and shortfall tax detriment associated with share based award in the consolidated statement of operation component of income tax expense when realized earnings loss per common share basic earnings loss per common share is computed by dividing net income loss attributable to qualcomm by the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the reporting period diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income attributable to qualcomm by the combination of dilutive common share equivalent comprised of share issuable under our share based compensation plan and share subject to accelerated share repurchase agreement if any and the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the reporting period the accelerated share repurchase agreement were entered into in fiscal note and due to the net loss in fiscal all of the common share equivalent issuable under share based compensation plan had an anti dilutive effect and were therefore excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share the following table provides information about the diluted earnings

the tax legislation fundamentally changed the taxation of multinational entity including shift from system of worldwide taxation with deferral to hybrid territorial system featuring participation exemption regime with current taxation of certain foreign income minimum tax on low taxed foreign earnings and new measure to deter base erosion and promote production fiscal year taxpayer certain provision of the tax legislation became effective starting at the beginning of fiscal including gilti global intangible low taxed income new tax on income of foreign corporation beat base erosion and anti abuse tax and fdii foreign derived intangible income in response to the tax legislation and to better align our profit with our activity we implemented certain tax restructuring in fiscal and result beginning in fiscal substantially all of our income is in the of which significant portion qualifies for preferential treatment fdii at effective tax rate the impact of gilti and beat is negligible accordingly our annual effective tax rate for fiscal reflected the effect of these provision of the tax legislation our annual effective tax rate for fiscal reflected blended federal

check the box election effective beginning in fiscal and although beginning in fiscal the income of these entity will be included in our consolidated tax return we believe that by treating these foreign subsidiary branch for federal income tax rather than controlled foreign corporation we will significantly reduce the risk of being subject to gilti and beat tax result of making these check the box election we recorded tax benefit of million in the first quarter of fiscal due to establishing new net deferred tax asset resulting from the difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax carryover basis of the existing asset and liability of those foreign subsidiary primarily related to customer incentive liability that have not been deducted for tax purpose additionally during fiscal one of our foreign subsidiary distributed certain intellectual property to subsidiary resulting in difference between the gaap basis and the federal tax basis of the distributed intellectual property upon adoption of new accounting guidance in the first quarter of fiscal we recorded deferred tax asset of approximately billion primarily related to the distributed intellectual property with

of billion recorded in other liability and included federal current provision in the component of the income tax provision income tax expense for fiscal also reflected benefit from our fdii deduction including the impact of the apple settlement and research and development credit well the impact of the ec fine which is not deductible for tax purpose in fiscal result of the tax legislation we

fourth quarter of fiscal related to the termination fee paid to nxp which did not result in tax benefit after the consideration of realizability of such loss fiscal and income tax expense wa impacted by the ec kftc and tftc fine and settlement with the tftc which were not deductible for tax purpose or taxable in the case of the settlement and portion of which were attributable to foreign jurisdiction and to the united state these impact were partially offset in fiscal and by lower revenue primarily related to decreased royalty revenue from apple contract manufacturer and for fiscal payment to blackberry in connection with an arbitration decision income tax expense for fiscal reflected an increase in our singapore tax rate result of the expiration of certain of our tax incentive in march which wa substantially offset by tax benefit resulting from the increase in our singapore tax rate in effect when certain deferred tax asset reversed during the third quarter of fiscal we entered into new tax incentive agreement in singapore that result in reduced tax rate from march through march provided that we meet specified employment and investment criterion in singapore our singapore tax rate will increase in march result of expiration of these incentive and again in march upon the expiration of tax incentive under prior agreement during fiscal one of our singapore

coerce oems original equipment manufacturer to accept license term that include unreasonably high royalty rate refusing to license our cellular standard essential patent to competitor selling cellular modem chip and entering into exclusive dealing arrangement with oems that foreclosed our rival the court further found that the royalty we charge oems are unreasonably high and reflect the use of our monopoly power over cdma and premium tier lte cellular modem chip rather than just the value of our patent the court concluded that our unreasonably high royalty constitute an anticompetitive surcharge on cellular modem chip sold by our competitor which increase the effective price of our competitor cellular modem chip reduces their margin and result in exclusivity the court also found that our practice of not licensing competitor cellular modem chip violated our commitment to certain standard development organization and duty under the antitrust law to license competing cellular modem chip maker and helped maintain our royalty at unreasonably high level finally the court found that incentive fund entered into with certain oems further harmed competing cellular modem chip maker ability to undermine our monopoly position prevented rival from entering the market and restricted the sale of those competitor that do enter the court concluded that the combined effect of our conduct together with our monopoly power harmed the competitive process the court imposed the following injunctive relief we must not condition the supply of cellular modem chip on customer patent
