industrial customer may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirement which for some may have the potential to reduce their demand for electricity or natural gas the southern company system may be exposed to regulatory and financial risk related to the impact of ghg legislation regulation and emission reduction goal concern and activism about climate change continue to increase and result demand for energy conservation and sustainable asset could further increase additionally cost associated with ghg legislation regulation and emission reduction goal could be significant the southern company system ha robust process for identifying assessing and responding to climate related risk including scenario planning process that is used to inform resource planning decision in the state in which the traditional electric operating company operate this process relies on information from internal and external source which may or may not be accurate in predicting future outcome each year the southern company system develops scenario which look over year horizon in scenario included wide range of fuel price load growth and price starting between and per metric ton of emitted and escalating over the year horizon additional ghg policy including legislation may emerge requiring the united state to accelerate it transition to lower ghg emitting economy however the ultimate impact will depend on various factor such state adoption and implementation of requirement natural gas price the development deployment and advancement of relevant energy technology the ability to recover cost through existing ratemaking provision and the outcome of pending and or future legal challenge because natural gas is fossil fuel with lower carbon content relative to other fossil fuel future carbon constraint including but not limited to the imposition of carbon tax may create additional demand for natural gas both for production of electricity and direct use in home and business however such demand may be tempered by legislation limiting the use of natural gas in certain situation such new construction additionally effort to electrify the transportation and building sector may result in higher electric demand and negatively impact natural gas demand future ghg constraint including those related to methane emission designed to minimize emission from natural gas could likewise result in increased cost to the southern company system and affect the demand for natural gas well the price charged to customer and the competitive position of natural gas southern company ha established an intermediate goal of reduction in ghg emission from level by and long term goal of net zero ghg emission by achievement of these goal is dependent on many factor including natural gas price and the pace and extent of development and deployment of low to no ghg energy technology and negative carbon concept the strategy to achieve these goal also relies on continuing to pursue diverse portfolio including low carbon and carbon free resource and energy efficiency resource continuing to transition the southern company system generating fleet and making the necessary related investment in transmission and distribution system continuing research and development with particular focus on technology that lower ghg emission including method of removing carbon

increase to address ever changing intense complex and sophisticated cyber risk the southern company system may not be able to obtain adequate natural gas fuel supply and other resource required to operate the traditional electric operating company and southern power electric generating plant or serve southern company gas natural gas customer sc on behalf of the traditional electric operating company and southern power purchase fuel for the southern company system generation fleet from diverse set of supplier southern company gas primary business is the distribution of natural gas through the natural gas distribution utility natural gas is delivered daily from different region of the country this daily supply is complemented by natural gas supply stored in both company owned and third party storage location to deliver this daily supply and stored natural gas the southern company system ha firm transportation capacity contracted with third party interstate pipeline disruption in the supply and or delivery of fuel result of matter such transportation delay weather labor relation force majeure event or environmental regulation affecting fuel supplier could limit the ability of the traditional electric operating company and southern power to operate certain facility which could result in higher fuel and operating cost and the ability of southern company gas to serve it natural gas customer table of content index to financial statementsthe southern company system is dependent upon natural gas fuel source for it power generation need which ha the potential to impact among other thing the traditional electric operating company and southern power cost of generation the robust growth in supply allowed natural gas price to moderate and remain below per mmbtu in recent year however demand increase beginning in and continuing in resulted in price increase and high volatility the henry hub price averaged per mmbtu in current forecast for are approximately forward market price for and beyond indicate expectation absent unforeseen development that price will modestly increase with the majority of natural gas production being from shale gas formation any limitation on shale gas production would be expected to have material impact on the supply availability well the cost of natural gas in addition new demand in particular export to mexico and those from lng facility ha grown significantly and is having greater impact on the traditional electric operating company and southern power natural gas market the traditional electric operating company are also dependent on coal and related coal supply contract for portion of their electric generating capacity the counterparties to coal supply contract may not fulfill their obligation to supply coal because of financial or technical problem in addition the supplier and or railroad may be delayed in supplying or delivering or may not be required to supply or deliver coal under certain circumstance such in the event of natural disaster if the traditional electric operating company are unable to obtain their contracted coal requirement they may be required to purchase additional coal at higher price or limit coal generation and these increased cost may not be recoverable through rate if deemed to be imprudently incurred the railroad industry ha been experiencing labor shortage which ha led to delay in coal delivery coal fired generating facility are retired the demand for coal is expected to continue to decline result railroad may commit fewer resource to coal transportation which could increase these risk whereas fuel oil directly provides only small portion of the southern company system annual generation it importance to the reliability of the southern company system generation portfolio continues to grow over the last few year related cost increase and supply chain challenge have become more common and may increase the risk of reliability challenge in addition to fuel supply the traditional electric operating company and southern power also need adequate access to water which is drawn from nearby source to aid in the production of electricity any impact to their water resource could also limit the ability of the traditional electric operating company and southern power to operate certain facility which could result in higher fuel and operating cost the revenue of southern company the traditional electric operating company and southern power depend in part on sale under ppas the success of which depend on ppa counterparties performing their obligation southern company subsidiary satisfying minimum requirement under the ppas and renewal or replacement of the ppas for the related generating capacity most of southern power generating capacity ha been sold to purchaser under ppas with southern power top three customer comprising approximately of southern power total revenue for the year ended december the traditional electric operating company have entered into ppas with non affiliated party for the sale of generating capacity the revenue related to ppas are dependent on the continued performance by the purchaser of their obligation although the credit evaluation undertaken and contractual protection implemented by southern power and the traditional electric operating company take into account the possibility of default by purchaser actual exposure to default by purchaser may be greater than predicted or specified in the applicable contract additionally neither southern power any traditional electric operating company can predict whether the ppas will be renewed at the end of their respective term or on term any renewal may be made if one of these registrant is unable to replace expiring ppas with an acceptable new revenue contract it may be required to sell the power produced by the facility at wholesale price and be exposed to market fluctuation and risk or the affected site may temporarily or permanently cease operation the failure to satisfy minimum operational or availability requirement under these ppas including ppas related to project under construction could result in payment of damage or termination of the ppas increased competition from other company that supply energy or generation and storage technology and change in customer demand for energy could negatively impact southern company and it subsidiary the traditional electric operating company operate under business model that invests capital to serve customer and recovers those investment and earns return for investor through state regulation southern power business model is primarily focused on investing capital or building energy asset to serve creditworthy counterparties using bilateral contract model key premise of these business model is that generating power at power plant achieves economy of scale and produce power at competitive cost customer and stakeholder are increasingly focused on the registrant ability to meet rapidly changing demand for new and varied product service and offering additionally the risk of global climate change continues to shape customer and stakeholder sustainability goal and energy need table of content index to financial statementsnew technology such distributed energy resource and microgrids and increased customer and stakeholder demand for sustainable asset could change the type of asset constructed and or the method for cost recovery advance in these technology or change in law or regulation could reduce the cost of distributed generation storage technology or other alternative method of producing power to level that is competitive with that of most power generation production or result in smaller scale more fuel efficient and or more cost effective distributed generation that allows for increased self generation by customer broader use of distributed generation by retail energy customer may also result from customer changing perception of the merit of utilizing existing generation technology or tax or other economic incentive additionally state psc or legislature may modify certain aspect of the traditional electric operating company business result of these advance in technology which may provide for further competition from these alternative source of generation it is also possible that rapid advance in power generation technology could reduce the value of the current electric generating facility owned by the traditional electric operating company and southern power change in technology could also alter the channel through which electric customer buy or utilize power southern company gas business is dependent on natural gas price remaining competitive compared to other form of energy southern company gas gas marketing service segment also is affected by competition from other energy marketer providing similar service in southern company gas unregulated service territory most notably in illinois and georgia if new technology become cost competitive and achieve sufficient scale the market share of the subsidiary registrant could be eroded and the value of their respective electric generating facility or natural gas distribution facility could be reduced additionally these technology and customer induced change to the electric generation business model could change the risk profile of the southern company system historical capital investment southern company gas market share could be reduced if southern company gas can not remain price competitive in it unregulated market the subsidiary registrant are subject to workforce factor that could affect operation the southern company system must attract train and retain workforce to meet current and future need event such an aging workforce without appropriate replacement increased cost or reduced supply of labor mismatch of skill set to future need or unavailability of contract resource may lead to operating challenge such lack of resource loss of knowledge and lengthy time period associated with skill development including workforce need associated with major construction project and ongoing operation the southern company system may be subject to workforce trend occurring in the united state triggered by decision of employee to leave the workforce and or their employer at higher rate compared to prior year and challenge competing with other employer offering more flexible or fully remote work option the southern company system cost including cost for contractor to replace employee productivity cost and safety cost may rise failure to hire and adequately obtain replacement employee including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employee or the future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect southern company and it subsidiary ability to manage and operate their business supply chain disruption and inflation could negatively impact operation the southern company system operation and business plan depend on the global supply chain to procure equipment material and other resource the delivery of component material equipment and other resource that are critical to the southern company system operation ha been impacted by ongoing domestic and global supply chain disruption international tension including the ramification of regional conflict could further exacerbate global supply chain disruption these disruption and shortage could adversely impact business operation the constraint in the supply chain also could restrict availability and delay construction maintenance or repair of item needed to support normal operation or to continue planned capital investment supply chain disruption have contributed to higher price of component material equipment and other needed commodity and these inflationary increase may continue while inflation in the united state had been relatively low in recent year it impact became more significant during

continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecast on regular basis to incorporate current information available particularly in the area of start up testing and related test result engineering support commodity installation system turnover and workforce statistic the projected schedule for unit primarily depends on the progression of final component and pre operational testing and start up which may be impacted by further equipment component and or other operational challenge the projected schedule for unit primarily depends on potential impact arising from unit testing activity overlapping with unit start up and commissioning maintaining overall construction productivity and production level particularly in subcontractor scope of work and maintaining appropriate level of craft laborer any further delay could result in later in service date and cost increase various design and other licensing based compliance matter including the timely submittal by southern nuclear of the itaac documentation and the related review and approval by the nrc necessary to support nrc authorization to load fuel for unit may arise which may result in additional license amendment request or require other resolution if any license amendment request or other licensing based compliance issue including inspection and itaacs for unit are not resolved in timely manner there may be delay in the project schedule that could result in increased cost the ultimate outcome of these matter can not be determined at this time however any extension of the in service date beyond the second quarter for unit or the first quarter for unit including the joint owner cost sharing and tender impact described in note is estimated to result in additional base capital cost for georgia power of up to million per month for unit and million per month for unit well the related afudc and any additional related construction support resource or testing cost while georgia power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amount related to the cost sharing and tender provision of the joint ownership agreement described above management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery any further change to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rate will be required to be charged to income and such charge could be material given the significant complexity involved in estimating the future cost to complete construction and start up of plant vogtle unit and and the significant management
