looking statement should refer to the explanation of the qualification and limitation on forward looking statement in item business under the caption forward looking statement we must develop new product adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introduction of new product by competitor to remain competitive our growth strategy includes significant investment in and expenditure for product development we sell our product in several industry that are characterized by rapid and significant technological change frequent new product and service introduction and enhancement and evolving industry standard competitive factor include technological innovation price service and delivery breadth of product line customer support business capability and the ability to meet the special requirement of customer our competitor may adapt more quickly to new technology and change in customer requirement than we can without the timely introduction of new product service and enhancement our product and service will likely become technologically obsolete over time in which case our revenue and operating result would suffer many of our existing product and those under development are technologically innovative and require significant planning design development and testing at the technological product and manufacturing process level our customer use many of our product to develop test and manufacture their own product result we must anticipate industry trend and develop product in advance of the commercialization of our customer product if we fail to adequately predict our customer need and future activity we may invest heavily in research and development of product and service that do not lead to significant revenue it may be difficult for to implement our strategy for improving internal growth some of the market in which we compete have been flat or declining over the past several year to address this issue we are pursuing number of strategy to improve our internal growth including strengthening our presence in selected geographic market allocating research and development funding to product with higher growth prospect developing new application for our technology expanding our service offering continuing key customer initiative combining sale and marketing operation in appropriate market to compete more effectively finding new market for our product and continuing the development of commercial tool and infrastructure to increase and support cross selling opportunity of product and service to take advantage of our depth in product offering we may not be able to successfully implement these strategy and these strategy may not result in the expected growth of our business our business is affected by general economic condition and related uncertainty affecting market in which we operate our business is affected by general economic condition both inside and outside the if the global economy and financial market or economic condition in europe the or other key market are unstable it could adversely affect the business result of operation and financial condition of the company and it customer distributor and supplier having the effect of reducing demand for some of our product increasing the rate of order cancellation or delay increasing the risk of excess and obsolete inventory increasing pressure on the price for our product and service and creating longer sale cycle and greater difficulty in collecting sale proceeds demand for some of our product depends on capital spending policy of our customer and on government funding policy our customer include pharmaceutical and chemical company laboratory university healthcare provider government agency and public and private research institution many factor including public policy spending priority available resource and product and economic cycle have significant effect on the capital spending policy of these entity spending by some of these customer fluctuates based on budget allocation and the timely passage of the annual federal budget an impasse in federal government budget decision could lead to substantial delay or reduction in federal spending fisher scientific inc risk factor continued multinational corporation we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate which could adversely affect our cash flow and result of operation international market contribute substantial portion of our revenue and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these region the exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange rate take on different form international revenue and cost are subject to the risk that fluctuation in exchange rate could adversely affect our reported revenue and profitability when translated into dollar for financial reporting purpose these fluctuation could also adversely affect the demand for product and service provided by multinational corporation our business occasionally invoice third party customer in currency other than the one in which they primarily do business the functional currency movement in the invoiced currency relative to the functional currency could adversely impact our cash flow and our result of operation should our international sale grow exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange rate could have larger effect on our financial result in currency translation had an unfavorable effect of million on revenue due to the strengthening of the dollar relative to other currency in which the company sell product and service significant development stemming from the recent presidential election or the referendum on membership in the eu could have an adverse effect on the new administration ha called for substantial change to trade agreement such the north american free trade agreement nafta and ha raised the possibility of imposing significant increase on tariff on good imported into the united state particularly from china and mexico the new administration ha also indicated an intention to request congress to make significant change replacement or elimination of the patient protection and affordable care act and government negotiation regulation of drug price paid by government program change in social political regulatory and economic condition or law and policy governing the health care system and drug price foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territory and country where we or our customer operate could adversely affect our operating result and our business additionally on june the united kingdom held referendum and voted in favor of leaving the european union or eu this referendum ha created political and economic uncertainty particularly in the united kingdom and the eu and this uncertainty may last for year our business could be affected during this period of uncertainty and perhaps longer by the impact of the united kingdom referendum in addition our business could be negatively affected by new trade agreement the united kingdom and other country including the united state and by the possible imposition of trade or other regulatory barrier in the united kingdom these possible negative impact and others resulting from the united kingdom actual or threatened withdrawal from the eu may adversely affect our operating result and our customer business our inability to protect our intellectual property could have material adverse effect on our business in addition third party may claim that we infringe their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense result we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technology product and process because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new product through the development process and into the marketplace our success depends in part on our ability to develop patentable product and obtain and enforce patent protection for our product both in the united state and in other country we own numerous and foreign patent and we intend to file additional application appropriate for patent covering our product patent may not be issued for any pending or future patent application owned by or licensed to and the claim allowed under any issued patent may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology any issued patent owned by or licensed to may be challenged invalidated or circumvented and the right under these patent may not provide with competitive advantage in addition competitor may design around our technology or develop competing technology intellectual property right may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign country which could make it easier for competitor to capture increased market position we could incur substantial cost to defend in suit brought or in suit in which we may assert our patent right against others an unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could materially adversely affect our business and result of operation we also rely on trade secret and proprietary know how with which we seek to protect our product in part by confidentiality agreement with our collaborator employee and consultant these agreement may be breached and we may not have adequate remedy for any breach in addition our trade secret may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitor third party may assert claim against to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property right our life technology subsidiary is party to several lawsuit in which plaintiff claim we infringe their intellectual property note we could incur substantial cost and diversion of management resource in defending these claim which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation in addition party making these claim could secure judgment awarding substantial damage well injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to make use sell distribute or market our product and service in the united state or abroad in the event that claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against or third party not affiliated with hold pending or issued patent that relate to our product or technology we may seek license to such intellectual property or challenge those patent fisher scientific inc risk factor continued however we may be unable to obtain these license on commercially reasonable term if at all and our challenge of the patent may be unsuccessful our failure to obtain the necessary license or other right could prevent the sale manufacture or distribution of our product and therefore could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation change in governmental regulation may reduce demand for our product or increase our expense we compete in many market in which we and our customer must comply with federal state local and international regulation such environmental health and safety and food and drug regulation we develop configure and market our product to meet customer need created by those regulation any significant change in regulation could reduce demand for our product or increase our expense for example many of our instrument are marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for use in discovering and developing drug change in the food and drug administration regulation of the drug discovery and development process could have an adverse effect on the demand for these product if our security product do not operate designed and fail to detect explosive or radiation we could be exposed to product liability and related claim for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage product currently or previously sold by our environmental and process instrument and radiation measurement and security instrument business include fixed and portable instrument used for chemical radiation and trace explosive detection these product are used in airport embassy cargo facility border crossing and other high threat facility for the detection and prevention of terrorist act if any of these product to malfunction it is possible that explosive or radioactive material could fail to be detected by our product which could lead to product liability claim are also many other factor beyond our control that could lead to liability claim such the reliability and competence of the customer operator and the training of such operator any such product liability claim brought against could be significant and any adverse determination may result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage although we carry product liability insurance we can not be certain that our current insurance will be sufficient to cover these claim or that it can be maintained on acceptable term if at all our inability to complete pending acquisition or to successfully integrate any new or previous acquisition could have material adverse effect on our business our business strategy includes the acquisition of technology and business that complement or augment our existing product and service certain acquisition may be difficult to complete for number of reason including the need for antitrust and or other regulatory approval any acquisition we may complete may be made at substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable asset of the acquired company we may not be able to integrate acquired business successfully into our existing business make such business profitable or realize anticipated cost saving or synergy if any from these acquisition which could adversely affect our business moreover we have acquired many company and business result of these acquisition we recorded significant goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset primarily tradenames on our balance sheet which amount to approximately billion and billion respectively of december in addition we have definite lived intangible asset totaling billion of december we ass the realizability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset annually well whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that these asset may be impaired we ass the realizability of definite lived intangible asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that these asset may be impaired these event or circumstance would generally include operating loss or significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or asset our ability to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible asset will depend on the future cash flow of these business these cash flow in turn depend in part on how well we have integrated these business if we are not able to realize the value of the goodwill and intangible asset we may be required to incur material charge relating to the impairment of those asset we are subject to law and regulation governing government contract and failure to address these law and regulation or comply with government contract could harm our business by leading to reduction in revenue associated with these customer we have agreement relating to the sale of our product to government entity and result we are subject to various statute and regulation that apply to company doing business with the government the law governing government contract differ from the law governing private contract and government contract may contain pricing term and condition that are not applicable to private contract we are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulation governing government contract failure to comply with these regulation could result in suspension of these contract criminal civil and administrative penalty or debarment because we compete directly with certain of our larger customer and product supplier our result of operation could be adversely affected in the short term if these customer or supplier abruptly discontinue or significantly modify their relationship with our largest customer in the laboratory product business is also significant competitor our business may be harmed in the short term if our competitive relationship in the marketplace with certain of our large customer result in discontinuation of their purchase from in addition we manufacture product that compete directly with product that we fisher scientific inc risk factor continued source from third party supplier we also source competitive product from multiple supplier our business could be adversely affected in the short term if any of our large third party supplier abruptly discontinues selling product to because we rely heavily on third party package delivery service significant disruption in these service or significant increase in price may disrupt our ability to ship product increase our cost and lower our profitability we ship significant portion of our product to our customer through independent package delivery company such federal express in the and dhl in europe we also maintain small fleet of vehicle dedicated to the delivery of our product and ship our product through other carrier including national and regional trucking firm overnight carrier service and the postal service if one or more of these third party package delivery provider were to experience major work stoppage preventing our product from delivered in timely fashion or causing to incur additional shipping cost we could not pas on to our customer our cost could increase and our relationship with certain of our customer could be adversely affected in addition if one or more of these third party package delivery provider were to increase price and we were not able to find comparable alternative or make adjustment in our delivery network our profitability could be adversely affected we are required to comply with wide variety of law and regulation and are subject to regulation by various federal state and foreign agency for example some of our operation are subject to regulation by the food and drug administration and similar international agency these regulation govern wide variety of product activity from design and development to labeling manufacturing promotion sale and distribution if we fail to comply with the food and drug administration regulation or those of similar international agency we may have to recall product and or cease their manufacture and distribution which would increase our cost and reduce our revenue we are also subject to variety of federal state local and international law and regulation that govern among other thing the importation and exportation of product the handling transportation and manufacture of substance that could be classified hazardous and our business practice in the and abroad such anti corruption and anti competition law failure to comply with these law and regulation could result in criminal civil and administrative penalty our business could be adversely affected by disruption at our site we rely upon our manufacturing operation to produce many of the product we sell and our warehouse facility to store product pending sale any significant disruption of those operation for any reason such strike or other labor unrest power interruption fire or other event beyond our control could adversely affect our sale and customer relationship and therefore adversely affect our business we have significant operation in california near major earthquake fault which make susceptible to earthquake risk although of our raw material are available from number of potential supplier our operation also depend upon our ability to obtain raw material at reasonable price if we are unable to obtain the material we need at reasonable price we may not be able to produce certain of our product or we may not be able to produce certain of these product at marketable price which could have an adverse effect on our result of operation fluctuation in our effective tax rate may adversely affect our result of operation and cash flow global company we are subject to taxation in numerous country state and other jurisdiction in preparing our financial statement we record the amount of tax that is payable in each of the country state and other jurisdiction in which we operate our future effective tax rate however may be lower or higher than experienced in the past due to numerous factor including change in the mix of our profitability from country to country change in accounting for income tax and recently enacted and future change in tax law in jurisdiction in which we operate any of these factor could cause to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from previous period or our current expectation which could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and cash flow we may incur unexpected cost from increase in fuel and raw material price which could reduce our earnings and cash flow our primary commodity exposure are for fuel petroleum based resin and steel while we may seek to minimize the impact of price increase through higher price to customer and various cost saving measure our earnings and cash flow could be adversely affected in the event these measure are insufficient to cover our cost significant disruption in or breach in security of our information technology system could adversely affect our business part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information system we periodically implement new enterprise resource planning software and other software application to manage certain of our business operation we implement and add functionality problem could arise that we have not foreseen such problem could disrupt

estimatesthe company discussion and analysis of it financial condition and result of operation is based upon it financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state of america the preparation of these financial statement requires management to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent liability on an on going basis management evaluates it estimate including those related to bad debt inventory business combination intangible asset and goodwill sale return income tax contingency and litigation and pension cost management belief the most complex and sensitive judgment because of their significance to the consolidated financial statement result primarily from the need to make estimate about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain management base it estimate on historical experience current market and economic condition and other assumption that management belief are reasonable the result of these estimate form the basis for judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability where the value are not readily apparent from other source actual result may differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition the company belief the following represent it critical accounting policy and estimate used in the preparation of it financial statement account receivablethe company maintains allowance for doubtful account for estimated loss resulting from the inability of it customer to pay amount due such allowance totaled million at december the company estimate the amount of customer receivables that are uncollectible based on the age of the receivable the creditworthiness of the customer and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if the financial condition of the company customer were to deteriorate reducing their ability to make payment additional allowance would be required inventoriesthe company writes down it inventory for estimated excess quantity and obsolescence based on difference between the cost and estimated net realizable value taking into consideration usage in the preceding month fisher scientific inc management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationscritical accounting policy and estimate continued expected demand and any other information that is relevant to the judgment if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand additional writedowns may be required intangible asset and goodwillthe company us assumption and estimate in determining the fair value of asset acquired and liability assumed in business combination the determination of the fair value of intangible asset which represent significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company acquisition requires the use of significant judgment with regard to the fair value and ii whether such intangible are amortizable or non amortizable and if the former the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized the company estimate the fair value of acquisition related intangible asset principally based on projection of cash flow that will arise from identifiable intangible asset of acquired business the projected cash flow are discounted to determine the present value of the asset at the date of acquisition definite lived intangible asset totaled billion at december the company review definite lived intangible asset for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists such significant reduction in cash flow associated with the asset actual cash flow arising from particular intangible asset could vary from projected cash flow which could imply different carrying value from those established at the date of acquisition and which could result in impairment of such asset the company evaluates goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment annually and when event occur or circumstance change that may reduce the fair value of the asset below it carrying amount event or circumstance that might require an interim evaluation include unexpected adverse business condition economic factor unanticipated technological change or competitive activity loss of key personnel and act by government and court goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset totaled billion and billion respectively at december estimate of future cash flow require assumption related to revenue and operating income growth asset related expenditure working capital level and other factor different assumption from those made in the company analysis could materially affect projected cash flow and the company evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment indication of fair value based on projection of profitability for and thereafter and on peer revenue and earnings trading multiple were sufficient to conclude that no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset existed at the end of the tenth fiscal month of the date of the company impairment testing there can be no assurance however that an economic downturn will not materially adversely affect peer trading multiple and the company business such that they do not achieve their forecasted profitability and these asset become impaired should the fair value of the company goodwill or indefinite lived intangible asset decline because of reduced operating performance market decline or other indicator of impairment or result of change in the discount rate charge for impairment may be necessary with the completion of the fei acquisition in september the company established new reporting unit called material and structural analysis which consists of the former fei business because this reporting unit consists solely of the acquired business the book value of which equaled it fair value of the acquisition date no cushion of fair value over book value existed at the acquisition date during it goodwill impairment testing the company determined that the material and structural analysis reporting unit cushion of fair value over book value wa nominal of november given that the fair value is not substantially in excess of the book value relatively small decrease in future cash flow from forecasted result or change in discount rate or other assumption could result in impairment of goodwill the key variable that drive the cash flow of the reporting unit are level of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumption well the weighted average cost of capital wacc rate applied the estimate used for these assumption represent management best estimate which the company belief are reasonable these assumption however are subject to uncertainty including the degree to which the acquired business will grow revenue and profitability level the material and structural analysis reporting unit had billion of goodwill and had an overall carrying value of billion of december revenuesin instance where the company sell equipment with related installation obligation the company generally recognizes revenue related to the equipment when title pass the company recognizes revenue related to the installation when it performs the installation the allocation of revenue between the equipment and the installation is based on

management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationscritical accounting policy and estimate continued in instance where the company sell equipment with customer specified acceptance criterion the company must ass whether it can demonstrate adherence to the acceptance criterion prior to the customer acceptance testing to determine the timing of revenue recognition if the nature of customer specified acceptance criterion were to change or grow in complexity such that the company could not demonstrate adherence the company would be required to defer additional revenue upon shipment of it product until completion of customer acceptance testing the company record reduction to revenue for estimated product return by customer should greater or lesser number of
