commercial service during due to it disruption of global manufacturing supply chain and consumer spending in addition the covid pandemic and ongoing trade dispute have significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty the various stay at home order and shut down of commercial activity in major market around the world also led to unprecedented demand for residential delivery service rivaling our peak holiday season traffic we incurred increased cost associated with this demand and lower composite yield than our typical volume the length and severity of the impact to our result is currently uncertain although we are beginning to see some sign of improvement in commercial activity see impact of the covid pandemic below for more information weaker global economic condition including the impact of the covid pandemic negatively impacted our result in in addition our result in were negatively impacted by the elimination of business from large customer higher self insurance accrual increased cost to expand service the continued mix shift to lower yielding service and more competitive pricing environment these factor were partially offset by residential delivery volume

transpacific traffic wa affected by the shutdown in china and the curtailment of commercial air flight while commercial volume were down due to business closure across the world fedex ground residential delivery volume increased to seasonal peak level during the fourth quarter of due to stay at home order and other pandemic responsive measure the shift in mix negatively impacted operating margin and operating result in addition the covid pandemic negatively impacted fedex office operating performance during and store closure resulting from the pandemic contributed to the fedex office goodwill impairment charge recorded in see the goodwill and other asset impairment charge section of this md for more information during we incurred approximately million of increased operating expense related to personal protective equipment and medical safety supply well additional security and cleaning service in order to protect our team member and customer we continue to provide

increased transpacific and charter flight hour to align capacity with demand at fedex express see part item of this annual report under the caption covid pandemic for more information we remain committed to assisting our customer they work to manage their supply chain and inventory additionally we are capitalizing on the opportunity to deliver higher yielding shipment due to the capacity reduction in asia we are at the same time seeking to mitigate the impact of the covid pandemic on our financial position and operation by continuing to implement our transformation initiative we have also taken the following action to improve liquidity and strengthen our financial position reduced expected capital expenditure by approximately billion from the prior year including decreasing spending on vehicle and trailer delaying facility expansion and postponing certain information technology initiative implemented temporary surcharge on all oversized and residential domestic fedex express and fedex ground package effective june and on international package and airfreight shipment effective april at fedex express we also temporarily suspended money back guarantee for all fedex

service international domestic revenue per package relates to our international intra country operation international freight revenue per pound relates to our international priority economy and airfreight service revenue revenue decreased in primarily due to the elimination of business from large customer and the impact from macroeconomic weakness including the impact of the covid pandemic even though our revenue and operating income comparison were negatively affected by the elimination of business from large customer our customer base is diverse and no one customer comprises more than of our consolidated revenue in addition lower fuel surcharge at all transportation segment negatively impacted revenue in these item were partially offset by residential delivery volume growth at fedex ground including the sharp increase in demand resulting from the stay at home order and other responsive measure caused by the covid pandemic we implemented average list price increase at the beginning of the calendar year at each of our transportation segment some customer have contract that are not subject to these general rate increase we also implemented temporary surcharge on oversize residential and international shipment in response to the covid pandemic at fedex ground revenue increased in due to residential delivery volume growth partially offset by the decline in commercial delivery volume and the elimination of business from large customer revenue at fedex express decreased in primarily due to lower package revenue result of the elimination of business from large customer and the impact of the covid pandemic in addition unfavorable exchange rate and lower freight revenue negatively impacted revenue in fedex freight revenue decreased in due to decreased average daily shipment partially offset by higher revenue per shipment goodwill and other asset impairment charge in we recorded million of goodwill impairment charge of which million wa associated with fedex office and the remainder at fedex supply chain distribution system inc fedex supply chain result the goodwill attributed to each of these reporting unit ha been fully impaired the covid pandemic resulted in store closure and declining print revenue at fedex office during the fourth quarter of and is expected to continue to negatively impact it near term operating performance we also recorded million of other asset impairment charge at the fedex logistics operating segment in we made the decision to permanently retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine at fedex express to align with the need of the domestic network and modernize it aircraft fleet consequence of this decision noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share were recorded in the fedex express segment in seven of these aircraft were temporarily idled for additional information regarding these impairment charge see the critical accounting estimate section of this md and

cost associated with our based voluntary employee buyout program in other expense in include million of cost incurred in connection with the settlement of legal matter involving fedex ground our result declined in primarily due to weaker global economic condition including the impact of the covid pandemic the elimination of business from large customer higher self insurance accrual and increased cost to expand service self insurance cost were higher primarily due to increased cost associated with vehicle accident at fedex ground the rising cost of vehicle accident is occurring throughout the transportation industry reflected in the rise of third party insurance rate we have prioritized incremental investment in safety technology to address these trend in addition continued mix shift to lower yielding service and more competitive pricing environment negatively impacted our result during these factor were partially offset by residential delivery volume growth at fedex ground and increased yield at fedex freight in the year over year variable incentive compensation expense benefited operating income by approximately million in we recognized million million net of tax or per diluted share of goodwill and other asset impairment charge associated with the fedex office and fedex logistics operating segment in the fourth quarter of additionally we recorded asset impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engine at fedex express purchased transportation cost increased in primarily due to higher volume and increased contractor settlement rate at fedex ground including expanding residential delivery to seven day per week year round these item were partially offset by lower volume including the impact of the covid pandemic at fedex express and fedex freight favorable exchange rate at fedex express and lower utilization of third party transportation provider at fedex freight other operating expense increased in primarily due to higher self insurance accrual increased cost associated with the covid pandemic higher bad debt expense and higher outside service contract expense depreciation and amortization expense increased in primarily due to continued strategic investment program at all of our transportation segment fuel the following graph for our transportation segment show our average cost of jet and vehicle fuel per gallon for the year ended may fuel expense decreased during due to decreased fuel price fuel price represent only one component of the factor we consider meaningful in understanding the impact of fuel on our business consideration must also be given to the fuel surcharge revenue we collect accordingly we believe discussion of the net impact of fuel on our result which is comparison of the year over year change in these two factor is important to understand the impact of fuel on our business in order to provide information about the impact of fuel surcharge on the trend in revenue and yield growth we have included the comparative weighted average fuel surcharge percentage in effect for and in the accompanying discussion of each of our transportation segment most of our fuel surcharge are adjusted on weekly basis the fuel surcharge is based on weekly fuel price from two week prior to the week in which it is assessed some fedex express international fuel surcharge incorporate timing lag of approximately six to eight week the manner in which we purchase fuel also influence the net impact of fuel on our result for example our contract for jet fuel purchase at fedex express are tied to various index including the gulf coast index while many of these index are aligned each index may fluctuate at different pace driving variability in the price paid for jet fuel furthermore under these contractual arrangement approximately of our jet fuel is purchased based on the index price for the preceding week with the remainder of our purchase tied primarily to the index price for the preceding month and preceding day rather than based on daily spot rate these contractual provision mitigate the impact of rapidly changing daily spot rate on our jet fuel purchase because of the factor described above our operating result may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by significant amount or change by amount that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharge which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short term for more information see risk factor below we routinely review our fuel surcharge and periodically update the table used to determine our fuel surcharge at all of our transportation segment the net impact of fuel on operating income described below and for each segment below doe not include the impact from these ordinary course table change the net impact of fuel had slight benefit to operating income in decreased fuel price outpaced lower fuel surcharge the net impact of fuel on our operating result doe not consider the effect that fuel surcharge level may have on our business including change in demand and shift in the mix of service purchased by our customer in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel cost while fluctuation in fuel surcharge percentage can be significant from period to period fuel surcharge represent one of the many individual component of our pricing structure that impact our overall revenue and yield additional component include the mix of service sold the base price and extra service charge we obtain for these service and the level of pricing discount offered other income and expense interest expense increased million in primarily due to debt issuance during the year retirement plan mtm adjustment we incurred pre tax noncash mtm net loss of million in million net of tax or per diluted share and net loss of billion in billion net of tax or per diluted share from actuarial adjustment to pension and postretirement healthcare plan related to the measurement of plan asset and

with tax loss generated during that the care act will now allow to be carried back to tax year when the federal income tax rate wa during the fourth quarter of we filed non automatic application for change in accounting method with the internal revenue service irs to change the method of accounting for depreciation to retroactively apply final tax regulation issued during the year to certain asset placed in service during and if the irs approves our request we will recognize an income tax benefit in of approximately million and increase our estimated income tax refund from the carryback to by approximately million we maintain an ongoing process to review our corporate legal entity structure to ensure it is aligned with business operation and regulatory environment in which we operate potential outcome of recent review could include changing the tax status of certain foreign entity within our structure and favorably impact our effective tax rate in the first half of primarily through the adjustment of deferred tax balance related to our foreign operation the tax rate includes benefit of million from the reduction of valuation allowance on tax loss carryforwards due to certain business operational change from the integration of fedex express and tnt express in local jurisdiction which impacted our determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset in that

earnings which wa enacted part of the tcja certain guidance included in these final regulation is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of million cumulative benefit through notwithstanding this inconsistency we remain confident in our interpretation of the tcja and intend to defend this position through litigation if necessary however if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position we may be required to reverse the benefit previously recorded during we completed our accounting for the tax effect of the tcja within the one year measurement period allowed

generally and our business in particular make any expectation for inherently le certain the timing and pace of an economic recovery from the covid pandemic are currently the most profound uncertainty affecting our business while we anticipate increased demand for residential service to continue at fedex ground in we expect weak global economic condition significant uncertainty concerning the health impact of covid and increased supply and other cost caused by the pandemic to continue to impact our result of operation cash flow and liquidity in while restriction on commercial air traffic are in place we expect continued strong demand for international priority shipment and charter flight in however our international operation are much more sensitive to change in global trade than our domestic operation because of the higher concentration of business to business shipment internationally we will continue to manage network capacity flexing our network and making adjustment needed to align with volume and operating condition during we will expand fedex ground seven day residential delivery coverage to more than percent of the population in addition we will continue to focus on last mile residential delivery optimization by directing certain day definite residential fedex express shipment into the fedex ground network to increase efficiency and lower our cost to serve we also are focused on improving revenue quality and lowering cost through investment in technology aimed at improving productivity and safety during we will continue to execute our tnt express integration plan and we are scheduled to complete the integration of the fedex express and tnt express linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and begin offering an enhanced portfolio of international service we will leverage the capability that tnt express add to our portfolio which are expected to improve our european revenue and profitability while we expect to make significant progress on integration activity in particularly in europe integration work will continue after due to delay caused by the covid pandemic we now expect to complete the final phase of international air network interoperability in early calendar rather than the fall of calendar we expect to incur approximately million of integration expense in in the form of professional fee outside service contract salary and wage and other operating expense we expect the aggregate integration program expense to be approximately billion through the completion of the physical network integration of tnt express into fedex express in we may incur additional cost including investment that will further transform and optimize the combined business and fedex express international business the timing and amount of integration and other expense and capital investment may change we revise and implement our plan our capital expenditure for are expected to be approximately billion decrease of billion from due to decreasing spending on vehicle and trailer delaying facility expansion and postponing certain information technology initiative our expected capital expenditure include fedex express investment in aircraft fleet modernization strategic investment to improve productivity and safety and the indianapolis and memphis hub modernization and expansion program at fedex express our aircraft fleet modernization and hub modernization and expansion program at fedex express are multi year program that will entail significant investment over the next several year see the contractual cash obligation

current business and economic condition we are taking action to manage our cash flow and improve our liquidity including review and consideration of opportunity and strategy for capital expenditure reduction and deferral previously discussed operating expense reduction and consideration of alternative financing source in addition to our credit facility and unsecured debt market while we have experienced some slowing in the collection of account receivable due to the effect of the covid pandemic on our customer and an increase in credit risk particularly in the retail industry our cash flow and overall liquidity have not been materially impacted at this point based on our credit management process and working capital management we expect to benefit from certain of the relief provision of recently enacted and any future government program intended to provide economic relief to and global business in response to the covid pandemic including relief from certain income excise

any and tnt express integration expense our cash and cash equivalent balance at may includes billion of cash in foreign jurisdiction associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy we are able to access the majority of this cash without material tax cost the enactment of the tcja significantly reduced the cost of repatriating foreign earnings from tax perspective we do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these fund impairs our ability to meet our domestic debt or working capital obligation our capital expenditure are expected to be approximately billion in which will include aircraft modernization at fedex express and strategic investment to improve productivity and safety in addition we are making investment over multiple year of approximately billion to significantly expand the fedex express indianapolis hub and approximately billion to modernize the fedex express memphis world hub we expect approximately of capital expenditure in to be designated for growth initiative our expected capital expenditure for include billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payment toward future aircraft delivery at fedex express we have several aircraft modernization program underway that are supported by the purchase of boeing freighter and boeing freighter aircraft these aircraft are significantly more fuel efficient per unit than the aircraft type previously utilized and these expenditure are necessary to achieve significant long term operating saving and to replace older aircraft our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft

contribution to our pension plan will be required for the foreseeable future based on our funded status and the fact we have credit balance related to our cumulative excess voluntary pension contribution over those required that exceeds billion the credit balance is subtracted from plan asset to determine the minimum funding requirement therefore we could eliminate all required contribution to our principal pension plan for several year if we were to choose to waive part of that credit balance in any given year our pension plan have ample fund to meet expected benefit

cooperate with the chinese authority on the investigation critical accounting estimate the preparation of financial statement in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the united state requires management to make significant judgment and estimate to develop amount reflected and disclosed in the financial statement in many case there are alternative policy or estimation technique that could be used we maintain thorough process to review the application of our accounting policy and to evaluate the appropriateness of the many estimate that are required to prepare the financial statement of complex global corporation however even under optimal circumstance estimate routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstance and new or better information the estimate discussed below include the financial statement element that are either the most judgmental or involve the selection or application of alternative accounting policy and are material to our financial statement management ha discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of director and with our independent registered public accounting firm retirement plan overview we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan and are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement the rule for pension accounting are complex and can produce volatility in our earnings financial condition and liquidity we are required to record annual year end adjustment to our financial statement for the net funded status of our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan the funded status of our plan also impact our liquidity however the cash funding rule operate under completely different set of assumption and standard than those used for financial reporting purpose result our actual cash funding requirement can differ materially from our reported funded status over the past several year we have taken numerous action to reduce pension related risk and expense including the introduction of our portable pension account benefit freezing our traditional pension benefit employing liability driven investment strategy and permitting certain former employee with traditional pension benefit to make one time irrevocable election to receive their benefit in lump sum distribution in may we entered into an agreement with metropolitan life insurance company to purchase group annuity contract representing the transfer of approximately billion of our pension plan obligation the transaction transferred responsibility for pension benefit to metropolitan life insurance company for approximately of our retiree and beneficiary who satisfied certain condition and were receiving monthly benefit from participating pension plan there wa no change to the pension benefit for any plan participant result of this transaction the purchase of the group annuity contract wa funded directly by asset of the pension plan the group annuity contract reduced the size of our pension plan reduced our exposure to market risk and associated balance sheet volatility and eliminated the investment administrative and pension benefit guaranty corporation premium expense for approximately retiree we recognized million one time settlement loss in connection with this transaction which wa included in our year end mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment in november we announced the closing of our based defined benefit pension plan to new non union employee hired on or after january we will introduce an all plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employee with higher company match of up to across all based operating company during current eligible employee under the portable pension account ppa pension formula will be given one time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credit under the existing ppa formula and remain in the existing plan with it company match of up to or to cease receiving compensation credit under the ppa and move to the new plan with the higher match of up to change to the new plan structure become effective beginning january while this new program will provide employee greater flexibility and reduce our long term pension cost it will not have material impact on current or near term financial result the salary and employee benefit caption of our accompanying consolidated income statement includes retirement plan expense associated with service cost the other retirement plan expense income caption of our accompanying consolidated income statement includes our fourth quarter mtm adjustment expense associated with prior service and interest cost the expected return on asset eroa and settlement summary of our retirement plan cost over the past two year is follows in million defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan postretirement healthcare plan retirement plan mtm loss the component of the mtm adjustment are follows in million discount rate change demographic experience current year actuarial loss change in future assumption actual versus expected return on asset total mtm loss service cost for our defined benefit pension and postretirement healthcare plan wa million in and million in and is expected to be approximately million in the weighted average discount rate for all our pension and postretirement healthcare plan decreased basis point from at may to at may the demographic experience in reflects an update to our mortality assumption and current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumption the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa higher than our expected return of return seeking asset primarily equity were positive despite equity market volatility additionally fixed income asset performed expected interest rate declined the demographic experience in reflected update to several forward looking assumption including retirement rate disability incidence rate and salary increase assumption and current year actuarial loss due to unfavorable experience compared to various demographic assumption the actual rate of return which is net of all fee and expense on our pension plan asset of wa lower than our expected return of lower than expected equity return negatively impacted return seeking asset while fixed income asset performed expected due to declining interest rate discount rate the discount rate is the interest rate used to discount the estimated future benefit payment that have been accrued to date the projected benefit obligation or pbo to their net present value and to determine the succeeding year ongoing pension expense prior to any year end mtm adjustment the discount rate is determined each year at the plan measurement date the discount rate for our pension plan at each measurement date wa follows measurement date discount rate we determine the discount rate with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better in developing this theoretical portfolio we select bond that match cash flow to benefit payment limit our concentration by industry and issuer and apply screening criterion to ensure bond with call feature have low probability of being called to the extent scheduled bond proceeds exceed the estimated benefit payment in given period the calculation assumes those excess proceeds are reinvested at one year forward rate the measurement of our pbo and the related impact on our annual mtm adjustment is highly sensitive to the discount rate assumption for our largest pension plan basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our pbo by approximately billion and basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased our pbo by approximately billion however our annual net pension expense is le sensitive to change in the discount rate for example one basis point increase in the discount rate for our largest pension plan would have million effect on the fourth quarter mtm adjustment but only net impact on net pension expense plan asset the expected average rate of return on plan asset is long term forward looking assumption it is required to be the expected future long term rate of earnings on plan asset our pension plan asset are invested primarily in publicly tradable security and our pension plan hold only minimal investment in fedex common stock that is entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and expense and the investment return we can reasonably expect our investment management program to achieve in excess of the return we could expect if investment were made strictly in indexed fund for consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and the historical annual return on our pension plan asset calculated on compound geometric basis wa net of all fee and expense for the year period ended may for our pension plan one basis point change in our eroa would impact our pension expense by million funded status the following is information concerning the funded status of our pension plan of may on financial reporting basis in million funded status of plan projected benefit obligation pbo fair value of plan asset funded status of the plan cash amount cash contribution during the year benefit payment during the year funding the funding requirement for our pension plan are governed by the pension protection act of which ha aggressive funding requirement in order to avoid benefit payment restriction that become effective if the funded status determined under irs rule fall below at the beginning of plan year all of our pension plan have funded status level in excess of and our plan are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act additionally current benefit payment do not materially impact our total plan asset benefit payment for our pension plan for were approximately million or of plan asset over the past several year we have made voluntary contribution to our pension plan in excess of the minimum required contribution for no pension contribution are required for our pension plan they are fully funded under the employee retirement income security act and no voluntary contribution are anticipated see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for further information about our retirement plan income tax we are subject to income tax in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction our income tax are function of our income statutory tax rate and tax planning opportunity available to in the various jurisdiction in which we operate the acquisition of tnt express in expanded our foreign operation significantly and increased the complexity of our global operation from an income tax perspective the tax law in the various jurisdiction are complex and subject to different interpretation by and the respective governmental taxing authority result significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax position including evaluating uncertainty also our effective tax rate is significantly affected by the earnings generated in each jurisdiction so unexpected fluctuation in the geographic mix of earnings could significantly impact our tax rate our intercompany transaction are based on globally accepted transfer pricing principle which align profit with the business operation and function of the various legal entity in our international business we evaluate our tax position quarterly and adjust the balance new information becomes available these evaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law or their interpretation audit activity and change in our business in addition management considers the advice of third party in making conclusion regarding tax consequence tax contingency arise from uncertainty in the application of tax rule throughout the many jurisdiction in which we operate despite our belief that our tax return position are consistent with applicable tax law taxing authority could challenge certain position we record tax benefit for uncertain tax position based upon management evaluation of the information available at the reporting date to be recognized in the financial statement tax benefit must be at least more likely than not of being sustained based on the technical merit the benefit for position meeting the recognition threshold is measured the largest benefit more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with taxing authority that ha full knowledge of all relevant information significant judgment is required in making these determination and adjustment to unrecognized tax benefit may be necessary to reflect actual tax payable upon settlement deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination so there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we record the tax for global intangible low taxed income period cost our income tax position are based on currently enacted tax law including the tcja and the care act further guidance is issued by the treasury department the irs and other standard setting body any resulting change to our estimate will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance for more information including impact from the tcja and the care act see the income tax section of this md and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement self insurance accrual we are self insured up to certain limit for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim self insurance accrual reflected in our balance sheet were billion at may and billion at may approximately of these accrual were classified current liability our self insurance accrual are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claim incurred of the balance sheet date these estimate include consideration of factor such severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design cost trend on material accrual are updated each quarter we self insure up to certain limit that vary by type of risk periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense where estimable loss covered by insurance are recognized on gross basis with corresponding insurance receivable we believe the use of actuarial method to account for these liability provides consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accrual however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive given the magnitude of claim involved and the length of time until the ultimate cost is known we believe our recorded obligation for these expense are consistently measured on conservative basis nevertheless change in healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level and other factor can materially affect the estimate for these liability long lived asset useful life and salvage value our business is capital intensive with approximately of our owned asset invested in our transportation and information system infrastructure the depreciation or amortization of our capital asset over their estimated useful life and the determination of any salvage value requires management to make judgment about future event because we utilize many of our capital asset over relatively long period the majority of aircraft cost are depreciated over to year we periodically evaluate whether adjustment to our estimated service life or salvage value are necessary to ensure these estimate properly match the economic use of the asset this evaluation may result in change in the estimated life and residual value used to depreciate our aircraft and other equipment for our aircraft we typically assign no residual value due to the utilization of these asset in cargo configuration which result in little to no value at the end of their useful life these estimate affect the amount of depreciation expense recognized in period and ultimately the gain or loss on the disposal of the asset change in the estimated life of asset will result in an increase or decrease in the amount of depreciation recognized in future period and could have material impact on our result of operation described below historically gain and loss on disposal of operating equipment have not been material however such amount may differ materially in the future due to change in business level technological obsolescence accident frequency regulatory change and other factor beyond our control impairment of may the fedex express global air network included fleet of aircraft including approximately supplemental aircraft that provide delivery of package and freight to more than country and territory through wide range of and international shipping service while certain aircraft are utilized in primary geographic area versus international we operate an integrated global network and utilize our aircraft and other mode of transportation to achieve the lowest cost of delivery while maintaining our service commitment to our customer because of the integrated nature of our global network our aircraft are interchangeable across route and geography giving flexibility with our fleet planning to meet changing global economic condition and maintain and modify aircraft needed because of the lengthy lead time for aircraft manufacture and modification we must anticipate volume level and plan our fleet requirement year in advance and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection furthermore the timing and availability of certain used aircraft type particularly those with better fuel efficiency may create limited opportunity to acquire these aircraft at favorable price in advance of our capacity need these activity create risk that asset capacity may exceed demand at may all of our purchased aircraft were placed into service the accounting test for whether an asset held for use is impaired involves first comparing the carrying value of the asset with it estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the cash flow do not exceed the carrying value the asset must be adjusted to it current fair value we operate integrated transportation network and accordingly cash flow for most of our operating asset are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment further decision about capital investment are evaluated based on the impact to the overall network rather than the return on an individual asset we make decision to remove certain long lived asset from service based on projection of reduced capacity need or lower operating cost of newer aircraft type and those decision may result in an impairment charge asset held for disposal must be adjusted to their estimated fair value le cost to sell when the decision is made to dispose of the asset and certain other criterion are met the fair value determination for such aircraft may require management estimate there may not be active market for some of these aircraft such estimate are subject to revision from period to period in the normal management of our aircraft fleet we routinely idle aircraft and engine temporarily due to maintenance cycle and adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we had aircraft temporarily idled these aircraft have been idled for an average of five month and are expected to return to revenue service in order to meet expected demand during we made the decision to permanently retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine at fedex express to align with the need of the domestic network and modernize it aircraft fleet consequence of this decision noncash impairment charge of million million net of tax or per diluted share were recorded in the fedex express segment in the second quarter seven of these aircraft were temporarily idled during the fourth quarter of in consideration of the impact of the covid pandemic on certain of our business we reviewed long lived asset in our retail and logistics business unit for impairment based on our review we recognized immaterial asset impairment charge related to the fedex logistics operating segment lease we utilize operating lease to finance certain of our aircraft facility and equipment such arrangement typically shift the risk of loss on the residual value of the asset at the end of the lease period to the lessor in accordance with the new lease accounting standard adopted june we had approximately billion in operating lease liability and related right of use asset on the balance sheet of may the weighted average remaining lease term of all operating lease outstanding at may wa approximately ten year our lease generally contain option to extend or terminate the lease we reevaluate our lease on regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentive of exercising the renewal option and how they align with our operating strategy therefore substantially all the renewal option period are not included within the lease term and the associated payment are not included in the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability the option to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement the lease liability are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payment not paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transaction where we are the lessee the determination of whether lease is accounted for finance lease or an operating lease requires management to make estimate primarily about the fair value of the asset and it estimated economic useful life in addition our evaluation includes ensuring we properly account for build to suit lease arrangement and making judgment about whether various form of lessee involvement during the construction period allow the lessee to control the underlying leased asset during the construction period we believe we have well defined and controlled process for making these evaluation including obtaining third party appraisal for material transaction to assist in making these evaluation goodwill of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net asset acquired of may we had billion of recorded goodwill from our business acquisition representing the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net asset acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimate to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount an entity ha an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test an entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period we performed both qualitative and quantitative assessment of goodwill in the fourth quarter of and this included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodology principally the income or market approach classified level within the fair value hierarchy incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure estimate used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test change in forecasted operating result and other assumption could materially affect these estimate due to the level of uncertainty from the covid pandemic we adjusted our procedure for testing goodwill in by incorporating sensitivity in our valuation performed using the income approach we recorded an impairment charge of million attributable to our fedex office and fedex supply chain reporting unit in the fourth quarter of the covid pandemic resulted in store closure and declining print revenue at fedex office during the fourth quarter of and is expected to continue to negatively impact it near term operating performance based on these factor our outlook for the fedex office business and retail industry changed in the fourth quarter of which contributed million to the goodwill impairment charge while there are several factor negatively impacting near term result at fedex express including weak global economic condition and the timing and amount of tnt express integration program expense fedex express continues to be an established profitable business with fair value that exceeds it carrying value based on our valuation performed during the fourth quarter of in addition our other reporting unit with significant recorded goodwill include fedex ground and fedex freight we evaluated these reporting unit during the fourth quarter of and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit significantly exceeded their carrying value of the end of and therefore we do not believe that any of these reporting unit were impaired of the balance sheet date legal and other contingency we are subject to various loss contingency in connection with our operation contingent liability are difficult to measure their measurement is subject to multiple factor that are not easily predicted or projected further additional complexity in measuring these liability arises due to the various jurisdiction in which these matter occur which make our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain moreover different accounting rule must be employed to account for these item based on the nature of the contingency accordingly significant management judgment is required to ass these matter and to make determination about the measurement of liability if any certain pending loss contingency are described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement in the opinion of management the aggregate liability if any of individual matter or group of related matter not specifically described in note is not expected to be material to our financial position result of operation or cash flow the following describes our method and associated process for evaluating these matter because of the complex environment in which we operate we are subject to numerous legal proceeding and claim including those relating to general commercial matter governmental enforcement action employment related claim and fedex ground service provider accounting guidance for contingency requires an accrual of estimated loss from contingency such non income tax or other legal proceeding or claim when it is probable the future event or event are likely to occur that loss ha been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated this guidance also requires disclosure of loss contingency matter when in management judgment material loss is reasonably possible or probable during the preparation of our financial statement we evaluate our contingency to determine whether it is probable reasonably possible or remote that liability ha been incurred loss is recognized for all contingency deemed probable and estimable regardless of amount for unresolved contingency with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible we evaluate whether potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated our evaluation of these matter is the result of comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of loss or disclosure of these contingency is made in timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel well external counsel where applicable the process includes regular communication during each quarter and scheduled meeting shortly before the completion of our financial statement to evaluate any new legal proceeding and the status of existing matter in determining whether loss should be accrued or loss contingency disclosed we evaluate among other factor the current status of each matter within the scope and context of the entire lawsuit or proceeding the lengthy and complex nature of class action matter the procedural status of each matter any opportunity to dispose of lawsuit on it merit before trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment the amount of time remaining before trial date the status of discovery the status of settlement arbitration or mediation proceeding and our judgment regarding the likelihood of success prior to or at trial in reaching our conclusion with respect to accrual of loss or loss contingency disclosure we take holistic view of each matter based on these factor and the information available prior to the issuance of our financial statement uncertainty with respect to an individual factor or combination of these factor may impact our decision related to accrual or disclosure of loss contingency including conclusion that we are unable to establish an estimate of possible loss or meaningful range of possible loss we update our disclosure to reflect our most current understanding of the contingency at the time we issue our financial statement however event may arise that were not anticipated and the outcome of contingency may result in loss to that differs materially from our previously estimated liability or range of possible loss despite the inherent complexity in the accounting and disclosure of contingency we believe that our process are robust and thorough and provide consistent framework for management in evaluating the potential outcome of contingency for proper accounting recognition and disclosure risk factor wide range of factor could materially adversely affect our business result of operation financial condition access to source of liquidity and the price of our common stock the most significant of these factor include the following the covid pandemic ha adversely affected and we expect will continue to adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition the covid pandemic ha negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chain and created significant volatility and disruption of financial market due to the crucial role we play in moving supply chain and delivering critical relief we are considered an essential business and we continue to operate under and respond to evolving state of emergency and stay at home order issued in the and globally the disruption of global supply chain and the global economy ha materially affected our business result of operation and financial condition we expect the full impact of the covid pandemic including the extent of it effect on our financial condition and result of operation to be dictated by future development which remain uncertain and can not be predicted such it duration and spread the success of effort to contain it the possibility of subsequent widespread outbreak and the impact of action taken in response the covid pandemic ha had and we expect will continue to have certain negative impact on our business including but not limited to the following the covid pandemic ha had rapid and significant negative impact on the global economy the disruption of global supply chain interruption in economic activity preventative measure taken to alleviate the pandemic such stay at home order and other responsive measure and increased economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic have resulted in increased global economic weakness of an unknown duration deteriorating global economic condition have reduced business to business demand across all of our transportation business the various stay at home order and shut down of commercial activity in major market around the world ha also led to unprecedented demand for residential delivery service rivaling our peak holiday season traffic we incurred increased cost associated with this demand and lower composite yield than our typical service mix which negatively impacted our result of operation during prolonged economic weakness including an extended period of elevated level of unemployment in the could further reduce discretionary consumer spending and consumer confidence which could have further adverse effect on our result of operation we have made significant operational adjustment to align our service with shipping volume and operating condition and to comply with evolving governmental order rule and regulation result we are incurring additional operating expense we adjust to dramatically changed and continuously evolving market dynamic and operating condition and we may continue to incur similar expense in the future additionally we have reduced planned capital expenditure by decreasing planned spending on vehicle and trailer delaying facility expansion and postponing certain information technology initiative the covid pandemic ha also delayed completion of capital improvement and certain other initiative in europe related to the integration of tnt express if we are unable to remain agile and continue to flex our network to align with shipping volume customer need market demand and operating condition or are unable to continuously respond to evolving governmental policy for the duration of prolonged period of economic recovery our business operation could be negatively impacted which could have further adverse effect on our result of operation we rely on global workforce and our business demand we take measure to protect the health and safety of our team member customer and others with we do business while continuing to effectively manage our employee and maintain business operation we have taken additional measure and incurred additional expense to protect the health and safety of our team member and the public and continue to work with customer to accommodate special request around modified store hour closing and delivery alternative to comply with applicable government restriction and safety guidance due to the size scope and geographically dispersed nature of our operation the expense we incur to protect the health and safety of certain of our employee may be higher than similar expense incurred by company in other industry additionally our business operation may be disrupted if significant portion of our workforce is unable to work safely and effectively due to illness quarantine government action or other restriction or measure responsive to the pandemic or if member of senior management or our board of director are unable to perform their duty for an extended period of time measure taken across our business operation to address health and safety may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of covid among our team member customer and others therefore we could face operational disruption and incur additional expense including devoting additional resource to assisting employee diagnosed with covid and further changing health and safety protocol and process that could adversely affect our business and result of operation significant number of our employee well customer and others with whom we do business continue to work remotely in response to the covid pandemic our business operation may be disrupted and we may experience increased risk of adverse effect to our business if significant portion of our workforce or certain business operation are negatively impacted result of remote work arrangement including due to cyber risk or other disruption to our technology infrastructure further if our fedex express memphis world hub or another key operating facility experience closure or worker shortage result of covid whether temporary or sustained our business operation would be significantly disrupted cost management and various cost containment action implemented across our business in response to the covid pandemic could hinder execution of our business strategy including deferral of planned capital project these action could result in increased cost to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic and could adversely affect our business and result of operation for additional discussion see part item of this annual report under the caption strategy we can not be certain that loss or delay in the collection of account receivable will not have material adverse effect on our result of operation and financial condition for additional discussion see management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition financial condition liquidity outlook to the extent the covid pandemic adversely affect our business and financial result it may also have the effect of heightening many other risk described in this section any of which could materially and adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition such risk include but are not limited to additional change in international trade policy and relation our ability to successfully integrate the business and operation of fedex express and tnt express in the expected time frame and at the expected cost our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand our ability to manage our capital intensive business change to the business and financial soundness of the postal service usps workforce availability employee healthcare benefit cost constraint volatility or disruption in the capital market and our ability to access source of financing and liquidity and the impact of litigation or claim from customer team member supplier regulator or other third party relating to the covid pandemic or our action in response to the pandemic we are directly affected by the state of the economy and anti trade measure while macroeconomic risk apply to most company we are particularly vulnerable the transportation industry is highly cyclical and especially susceptible to trend in economic activity our primary business is to transport good so our business level are directly tied to the purchase and production of good key macroeconomic measurement when individual and company purchase and produce fewer good we transport fewer good and company expand the number of distribution center and move manufacturing closer to consumer market we transport good shorter distance in addition we have relatively high fixed cost structure which is difficult to quickly adjust to match shifting volume level moreover we continue to grow our international business we are increasingly affected by the health of the global economy the rate of growth of global trade world trade policy international tax government to government relation and the typically more volatile economy of emerging market for instance anti trade and protectionist measure adopted by the or other country in which we do business such trade control tariff quota embargo sanction or retaliation by another country against such measure could result in economic uncertainty and instability resulting in fewer good being transported globally in we saw customer preference for slower le costly shipping service additionally during weakness in the global economy adversely affected our result of operation and we expect such weakness to continue to be present during significant data breach or other disruption to our technology infrastructure could disrupt our operation and result in the loss of critical confidential information adversely impacting our reputation business or result of operation our ability to attract and retain customer to efficiently operate our business and to compete effectively depends in part upon the sophistication security and reliability of our technology network including our ability to provide feature of service that are important to our customer to protect our confidential business information and the information provided by our customer and to maintain customer confidence in our ability to protect our system and to provide service consistent with their expectation for example we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of physical receipt of package to track item that move through our delivery system to efficiently plan delivery to execute billing process and to track and report financial and operational data we are subject to risk imposed by data breach and operational disruption including through cyberattack or cyber intrusion including by computer hacker foreign government cyber terrorist cyber criminal and malicious employee or other insider data breach of company and government have increased in recent year the number intensity and sophistication of attempted attack and intrusion from around the world have increased and we our customer and third party increasingly store and transmit data by mean of connected information technology system additionally risk such code anomaly act of god transitional challenge in migrating operating company functionality to our fedex enterprise automation platform data leakage cyber fraud and human error pose direct threat to our product service system and data and could result in unauthorized or block legitimate access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information the technology infrastructure of acquired business well their practice related to the use and maintenance of data could also present issue that we were not able to identify prior to the acquisition we also depend on and interact with the technology and system of third party including our customer and third party service provider such cloud service provider and delivery service such third party may host process or have access to information we maintain about our company customer employee and vendor or operate system that are critical to our business operation and service like these third party are subject to risk imposed by data breach cyberattacks and other event or action that could damage disrupt or close down their network or system we have security process protocol and standard in place including contractual provision requiring such security measure that are applicable to such third party and are designed to protect information that is held by them or to which they have access result of their engagement with nevertheless cyberattack could defeat one or more of such third party security measure allowing an attacker to obtain information about our company customer employee and vendor or disrupt our operation these third party may also experience operational disruption or human error that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive or confidential data regarding our operation customer employee and supplier including personal information disruption to our complex global technology infrastructure including those impacting our computer system and website could result in the loss of confidential business or customer information require substantial repair or replacement resulting in significant cost and lead to the temporary or permanent transfer by customer of some or all of their business to our competitor the foregoing could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operation customer service and result of operation additionally security breach could require to devote significant management resource to address the problem created these type of adverse impact could also occur in the event the confidentiality integrity or availability of company and customer information wa compromised due to data loss by fedex or trusted third party we or the third party with which we share information may not discover any security breach and loss of information for significant period of time after the security breach occurs recently there ha also been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the at both the state and federal level and abroad and an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable or foreign data protection regulation or other data protection standard may expose to litigation including in some instance class action litigation fine sanction or other penalty which could harm our reputation and adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition this regulatory environment is increasingly challenging and may present material obligation and risk to our business including significantly expanded compliance burden cost and enforcement risk for example the european union eu general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective in may greatly increase the jurisdictional reach of eu law and add broad array of requirement related to personal data including individual notice and opt out preference and the public disclosure of significant data breach additionally violation of the gdpr can result in fine of much of company annual revenue other government have enacted or are enacting similar data protection law including data localization law that require data to stay within their border all of these evolving compliance and operational requirement well the uncertain interpretation and enforcement of law impose significant cost and regulatory risk that are likely to increase over time we have invested and continue to invest in technology security initiative information technology risk management business continuity and disaster recovery plan including investment to retire and replace end of life system the development and maintenance of these measure is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating technology change and effort to overcome security measure become increasingly more frequent intense and sophisticated despite our effort we are not fully insulated from data breach technology disruption data loss and cyber fraud which could adversely impact our competitiveness and result of operation for instance in june tnt express worldwide operation were significantly affected due to the infiltration of an information technology virus known notpetya in may fedex wa one of many company attacked by the rapidly spreading ransomware described wannacry that exploited vulnerability in third party software program and infected computer using that program encrypting file and holding them for ransom during the third quarter of we discovered an unsecured server hosted by one of our third party cloud service provider which exposed some archived account information related to service discontinued after our acquisition of bongo international llc the server ha been secured and we have found no indication that any information ha been misappropriated in connection with the incident additionally during we experienced continual attempt by cyber criminal some of which were successful to gain access to customer account for the purpose of fraudulently diverting and misappropriating item being transported in our network none of the wannacry ransomware attack unsecured server or fraudulent cyber activity caused material disruption to our system or resulted in any material cost to fedex while we have significant security process and initiative in place we may be unable to detect or prevent breach or disruption in the future additionally while we have insurance coverage designed to address certain aspect of cyber risk in place such insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all loss or all type of claim that may arise additional change in international trade policy and relation could significantly reduce the volume of good transported globally and adversely affect our business and result of operation the government ha made significant change in trade policy and ha taken certain action that have negatively impacted trade including imposing tariff on certain good imported into the united state to date several government including the eu china and india have imposed tariff on certain good imported from the united state these action contributed to weakness in the global economy that adversely affected our result of operation during fiscal and fiscal and we expect such weakness to continue to be present during fiscal any further change in or international trade policy could trigger additional retaliatory action by affected country resulting in trade war and further increased cost for good transported globally which may reduce customer demand for these product if the party to pay those tariff increase their price or in trading partner limiting their trade with country that impose anti trade measure political uncertainty surrounding international trade and other dispute could also have negative effect on business and consumer confidence and spending such condition could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock additionally the government ha taken action to limit the ability of domestic company to engage in commerce with certain foreign entity under certain circumstance and foreign government may investigate our compliance with these restriction for example the china state post bureau is currently conducting an investigation into the operation of fedex express regarding it handling of certain package while attempting to comply with the ear furthermore given the nature of our business and our global recognizability foreign government may target fedex by limiting the ability of foreign entity to do business with in certain instance imposing monetary or other penalty or taking other retaliatory action which could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition well on the price of our common stock for additional discussion see management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition other business matter the failure to successfully integrate the business and operation of fedex express and tnt express in the expected time frame and at the expected cost may adversely affect our future result prior to fedex acquisition of tnt express in fedex express and tnt express operated independent company there can be no assurance that these business can be integrated successfully expected integration cost have increased significantly since the acquisition wa completed and part of the integration have taken longer than initially expected it is possible that the integration process could result in higher than currently expected integration cost the loss of customer the disruption of ongoing business unexpected integration issue or the loss of key historical fedex express or tnt express employee it is also possible that the overall integration process will take longer than currently anticipated specifically the following issue among others must be addressed we integrate the operation of fedex express and tnt express in order to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction combining the company physical network and operation including integration of the company linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and air network and corporate function combining the business of fedex express and tnt express and meeting the capital requirement of the combination in manner that permit to achieve the operating and financial result we anticipated from the acquisition the failure of which could result in the anticipated benefit of the transaction not being realized in the time frame currently anticipated or at all integrating and consolidating the company administrative and information technology infrastructure and computer system and modernizing certain tnt express system which suffered from underinvestment prior to the acquisition integrating and restructuring the corporate entity integrating workforce and consulting with work council and employee representative while continuing to provide consistent high quality service to customer integrating and unifying the offering and service available to historical fedex express and tnt express customer harmonizing the company operating practice employee development and compensation program integrity and compliance program term and condition of contract of carriage internal control and other policy procedure and process integrating the company financial reporting and internal control system maintaining existing agreement with customer and service provider and avoiding delay in entering into new agreement with prospective customer and service provider addressing possible difference in business background corporate culture and management philosophy addressing employee social issue so to maintain efficient and effective labor and employee relation coordinating rebranding and marketing effort managing the movement of certain position to different location managing potential unknown and unidentified liability including liability that are significantly larger than currently anticipated and unforeseen increased expense or delay associated with the integration process and managing the expanded operation of significantly larger more complex company all of these factor could adversely affect fedex result of operation delay or decrease the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and negatively impact the price of our common stock the expected financial benefit of the acquisition may also be delayed or decreased by reduction in our base business level due to the continued impact of the covid pandemic and economic weakness in europe or other factor in addition at time the attention of certain member of our management may be focused on the integration of the business of fedex express and tnt express and diverted from day to day business operation which may disrupt our business further we may not achieve the expected financial benefit from any cost incurred in addition to our integration program expense related to investment to further transform and optimize the combined business and fedex express international business failure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic will cause our future financial result to suffer we are making significant investment and other decision in connection with our long term business strategy which includes our ability to meet the demand of commerce such aircraft fleet modernization and hub modernization and expansion at fedex express expansion of fedex ground residential delivery operation to seven day per week year round the integration of fedex smartpost package into the standard fedex ground operation last mile residential delivery optimization and autonomous delivery we are also implementing various cost containment action including limited hiring and discretionary spending such initiative and enhancement may require to make significant capital expenditure we have also incurred and may continue to incur increased operating expense in connection with certain change to our business strategy additionally in developing our business strategy we make certain assumption including but not limited to those related to customer demand and the mix of service to be purchased by our customer competition and the global economy and actual market economic and other condition may be different from our assumption technology customer behavior and market condition continue to evolve it is important that we maintain the relevance of our brand and service offering to our customer if we are not able to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to change in market dynamic our future financial result will suffer for additional discussion see part item of this annual report under the caption strategy our business depend on our strong reputation and the value of the fedex brand the fedex brand name symbolizes high quality service reliability and speed fedex is one of the most widely recognized trusted and respected brand in the world and the fedex brand is one of our most important and valuable asset in addition we have strong reputation among customer and the general public for high standard of social and environmental responsibility and corporate governance and ethic the fedex brand name and our corporate reputation are powerful sale and marketing tool and we devote significant resource to promoting and protecting them adverse publicity whether or not justified relating to activity by our team member or others with whom we do business such customer service mishap accident catastrophe or incident involving aircraft or vehicle operated by data breach or technology infrastructure disruption noncompliance with law or the shipment of certain item pursuant to our obligation common carrier operating under federal law could tarnish our reputation and reduce the value of our brand with the increase in the use of social medium outlet such facebook youtube instagram and twitter adverse publicity can be disseminated quickly and broadly making it increasingly difficult for to effectively respond damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could reduce demand for our service and thus have an adverse effect on our financial condition liquidity and result of operation well require additional resource to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand our failure to retain or attract employee talent or maintain our company culture could adversely impact our business our success depends upon the effort and ability of our high quality employee many of whom are longstanding fedex team member difficulty in motivating rewarding retaining and recruiting employee talent including successor to member of senior management or the unexpected loss of such individual resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base could have an adverse impact on our business result of operation reputation and the price of our common stock additionally our company culture is important to providing high quality customer service and having productive workforce and could be adversely affected by our growing operation and other factor if we fail to maintain the strength of our company culture our competitive ability and our business may be harmed the united kingdom withdrawal from the eu could adversely impact our business result of operation and financial condition on january the united kingdom left the eu brexit the united kingdom and eu are now in transitional period during which the united kingdom will maintain access to the eu single market and to the global trade deal negotiated by the eu on behalf of it member and remain subject to eu law until december the uncertainty regarding the status of brexit ha negatively impacted the united kingdom and the eu economy this negative impact will likely continue until the united kingdom and eu reach and implement definitive resolution on their future trading relationship any additional impact of brexit will depend on the term of such resolution even if the united kingdom maintains access to the eu single market and trade deal following the transition period brexit could result in further economic downturn globally if the united kingdom ultimately loses access to the eu single market and trade deal significant market and economic disruption would likely occur our customer experience service quality and international operation would likely be negatively impacted and the demand for our service could be depressed additionally we may face new regulation regarding trade aviation tax security and employee among others in the united kingdom compliance with such regulation could be costly negatively impacting our business result of operation and financial condition brexit could also adversely affect european and worldwide economic and market condition and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange market including volatility in the value of the euro and the british pound our transportation business are impacted by the price and availability of jet and vehicle fuel we must purchase large quantity of fuel to operate our aircraft and vehicle and the price and availability of fuel is beyond our control and can be highly volatile in addition our purchased transportation expense may be impacted by fuel cost to date we have been mostly successful in mitigating over time the expense impact of higher fuel cost through our indexed fuel surcharge the amount of the surcharge is closely linked to the market price for fuel if we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharge because of competitive pricing pressure or some other reason fuel cost could adversely impact our operating result of may we had no derivative financial instrument to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuation even if we are able to offset the cost of fuel with our surcharge high fuel surcharge could move our customer away from our higher yielding express service to our lower yielding deferred or ground service or even reduce customer demand for our service altogether in addition disruption in the supply of fuel could have negative impact on our ability to operate our transportation network weather related event natural disaster political disruption or war involving oil producing country economic sanction imposed against oil producing country or specific industry participant change in governmental policy concerning fuel production transportation tax or marketing change in refining capacity environmental concern and other unpredictable event may impact fuel supply and could result in shortage in the future our business are capital intensive and we must make capital decision based upon projected volume level we make significant investment in aircraft package handling facility vehicle technology sort equipment and other asset to support our transportation and business network we also make significant investment to rebrand integrate and grow the company that we acquire the amount and timing of capital investment depend on various factor including our anticipated volume growth we must make commitment to purchase or modify aircraft year before the aircraft are actually needed we must predict volume level and fleet requirement and make commitment for aircraft based on those projection missing our projection could result in much or too little capacity relative to our shipping volume overcapacity could lead to below market asset disposition or write down well negatively impact operating margin and undercapacity could negatively impact service level we face intense competition the transportation and business service market are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service especially in period of little or no macroeconomic growth some of our competitor have more financial resource and competitive advantage than we do appear willing to operate at little or no margin to gain market share or they are owned controlled or subsidized by foreign government which enables them to raise capital more easily we also compete with regional transportation provider that operate smaller and le capital intensive transportation network and startup company that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market need in addition some high volume package shipper are developing and implementing in house delivery capability and utilizing independent contractor for delivery which could in turn reduce our revenue and market share for example amazon com is investing significant capital to establish network of hub aircraft and vehicle we believe we compete effectively with these company for example by providing more reliable service at compensatory price however the existence of an irrational pricing environment could limit our ability not only to maintain or increase our price including our fuel surcharge in response to rising fuel cost but also to maintain or grow our revenue and market share while we believe we compete effectively through our current and planned service offering if our current competitor or potential future competitor offer broader range of service more effectively bundle their service or offer service at lower price it could impede our ability to maintain or grow our market share moreover if high volume package shipper further develop or expand internal capability for the service we provide it may reduce our revenue and could negatively impact our financial condition and result of operation news regarding such development or expansion could also negatively impact the price of our common stock additionally advancement in technology such advanced safety system automated package sorting handling and delivery autonomous delivery vehicle platooning alternative fuel vehicle and digitization of freight service may necessitate that we increase investment in order to remain competitive and our customer may not be willing to accept higher rate to cover the cost of these investment government regulation and enforcement are evolving and unfavorable change could harm our business we are subject to regulation under wide variety of federal and state and non regulation law and policy there can be no assurance that such regulation law and policy will not be changed in way that will decrease the demand for our service subject to escalating cost or require to modify our business model and objective harming our financial result in particular legislative regulatory or other action that and non government have undertaken or are considering in area such data privacy and sovereignty tax foreign exchange intervention in response to currency volatility currency control that could restrict the movement of liquidity from particular jurisdiction trade control tariff quota embargo or sanction in the or other country complex economic sanction export control additional security requirement additional requirement on employee including our pilot and benefit environmental standard tax reform and accounting may have an adverse effect on our operation liquidity capital requirement effective tax rate and performance for additional discussion see part item of this annual report under the caption regulation we could be subject to adverse change in regulation and interpretation or challenge to our tax position we are subject to taxation in the and numerous foreign jurisdiction from time to time change in tax law or regulation may be enacted that could significantly affect our overall tax liability such change may require new and complex computation to be performed significant judgment estimate and calculation to be made and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced standard setting body could interpret or issue guidance on how provision of certain tax law and regulation will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our interpretation and we may be required to make adjustment to amount that we have recorded that may adversely impact our result of operation and financial condition for example in january the treasury department issued final regulation covering the one time transition tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings which wa enacted part of the tcja certain guidance included in these final regulation is inconsistent with our interpretation that led to the recognition of benefit of million if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending our position with respect to our interpretation of the tcja we may be required to reverse these benefit if we do not successfully execute or effectively operate integrate leverage and grow acquired business our financial result and reputation may suffer our strategy for long term growth productivity and profitability depends in part on our ability to make prudent strategic acquisition and to realize the benefit we expect when we make those acquisition in furtherance of this strategy in addition to tnt express we have acquired business in europe latin america africa the asia and australia over the past several year acquisition involve special accounting regulatory compliance information technology human resource cultural and other risk while we expect our past and future acquisition to enhance our value proposition to customer and improve our long term profitability there can be no assurance that we will realize our expectation within the time frame we have established if at all or that we can continue to support the value we allocate to these acquired business including their goodwill or other intangible asset for example in we incurred goodwill impairment charge of million related to fedex office and fedex supply chain eliminating all of the goodwill attributable to these reporting unit for additional information see management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result goodwill and other asset impairment charge labor organization attempt to organize group of our employee from time to time and potential change in labor law could make it easier for them to do so if we are unable to continue to maintain good relationship with our employee and avoid having labor organization organize group of our employee our operating cost could significantly increase and our operational flexibility could be significantly reduced despite continual organizing attempt by labor union other than the pilot at fedex express and driver at one fedex freight inc facility our employee have thus far chosen not to unionize we acquired fedex supply chain in which already had small number of employee who are member of union additionally certain of fedex express non employee are unionized the congress ha in the past considered adopting change in labor law however that would make it easier for union to organize unit of our employee for example there is always possibility that congress could remove most fedex express employee from the jurisdiction of the railway labor act of amended the rla for additional discussion of the rla see part item of this annual report under the caption regulation such legislation could expose our customer to the type of service disruption that the rla wa designed to prevent local work stoppage in key area that interrupt the timely flow of shipment of time sensitive high value good throughout our global network such disruption could threaten our ability to provide competitively priced shipping option and ready access to global market there is also the possibility that congress could pas other labor legislation that could adversely affect our company such fedex ground and fedex freight whose employee are governed by the national labor relation act of amended nlra in addition federal and state governmental agency such the national mediation board and the national labor relation board have and may continue to take action that could make it easier for our employee to organize under the rla or nlra finally change to federal or state law governing employee classification could impact the status of fedex ground service provider independent employer of driver if fedex ground is deemed to be an employer or joint employer of the driver of these service provider labor organization could more easily organize these individual our operating cost could increase materially and we could incur significant capital outlay fedex ground relies on service provider to conduct it linehaul and pickup and delivery operation and the status of these service provider direct employer of driver providing these service is being challenged we are defending joint employer case where it is alleged that fedex ground should be treated an employer of the driver employed by service provider engaged by fedex ground we incur certain cost including legal fee in defending the status of service provider engaged by fedex ground direct employer of their driver we continue to believe that fedex ground is not an employer or joint employer of the driver of these independent business however adverse determination in these matter could among other thing entitle service provider driver to certain wage payment from the service provider and fedex ground and result in employment and withholding tax and benefit liability for fedex ground we are self insured for certain cost associated with our operation and insurance and claim expense could have material adverse effect on we are self insured up to certain limit that vary by type of risk for cost associated with worker compensation claim vehicle accident and general business liability and benefit paid under employee healthcare and disability program our reserve are established for estimate of loss on reported claim including incurred but not reported claim our self insurance accrual are primarily based on estimated cost determined by actuarial method estimated cost include consideration of variety of factor and related assumption such the severity of claim frequency and volume of claim healthcare inflation seasonality and plan design which may be subject to high degree of variability periodically we evaluate the level of insurance coverage and adjust insurance level based on risk tolerance and premium expense however the use of any estimation technique in this area is inherently sensitive material increase in the magnitude of claim change to healthcare cost accident frequency and severity insurance retention level judgment and settlement amount associated legal expense and other factor could result in unfavorable difference between actual self insurance cost and our reserve estimate result our insurance cost could increase materially which could adversely affect our result of operation and financial condition disruption or modification in service by the usps or change in it business or financial soundness could have an adverse effect on our operation and financial result the usps is vendor and significant customer of fedex in particular the usps is the largest customer of fedex express which provides domestic air transportation service for the usps first class mail priority mail express and priority mail and transportation and delivery for the usps international delivery service fedex express contract with the usps for domestic service expires in september the covid pandemic ha negatively impacted mail volume and mix resulting in further decrease in revenue and negative financial impact for the usps additionally the usps continues to experience budgetary uncertainty well increased political debate regarding potential privatization or restructuring of it operation disruption or modification in service by the usps result of financial difficulty or change in it business including the ability to access capital any structural change to it operation network service offering or pricing could adversely affect our operation negatively impacting our revenue result of operation and financial condition proposed pilot flight and duty time regulation could impair our operation and impose substantial cost on in september the federal aviation administration faa proposed regulation that would change the flight and duty time rule applicable to all cargo air carrier when the faa issued final regulation in december the regulation all cargo carrier including fedex express were exempt from these new requirement instead all cargo carrier were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rule and allowed to pursue the development of fatigue risk management system to develop fatigue mitigation unique to each operation in december the faa reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carrier from the regulation and litigation in the court of appeal for the district of columbia affirmed the faa decision however legislation ha recently been introduced in the senate and house of representative that if adopted would require all cargo carrier to comply with the regulation required compliance with the regulation would make it more difficult to avoid pilot fatigue and could impose substantial cost on in order to maintain operational reliability the transportation infrastructure continues to be target of terrorist activity because transportation asset continue to be target of terrorist activity government around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirement that will increase operating cost and potentially slow service for business including those in the transportation industry for example the transportation security administration tsa requires fedex express to comply with full all cargo aircraft operator standard security plan which contains evolving and strict security requirement additionally the international civil aviation organization currently allows member state to permit carrier and other entity to determine without government oversight which shipper and shipment are secure for purpose of putting those shipment on all cargo aircraft this allowance will be removed by july and may require to undergo additional screening and oversight by the tsa and similar government agency internationally security requirement such these are not static but change periodically the result of regulatory and legislative requirement imposing additional security cost and creating level of uncertainty for our operation thus it is reasonably possible that these rule or other future security requirement could impose material cost on or slow our service to our customer the impact on our operation of avoiding area of the world including airspace in which there are geopolitical conflict and the targeting of aircraft by party to those conflict can also be significant moreover terrorist attack directed at fedex or other aspect of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operation and adversely impact demand for our service the regulatory environment for global aviation or other transportation right may impact our operation and increase our operating cost our extensive air network is critical to our success our right to serve foreign point is subject to the approval of the department of transportation and generally requires bilateral agreement between the and foreign government in addition we must obtain the permission of foreign government to provide specific flight and service our operation outside of the such fedex express growing international domestic operation are also subject to current and potential regulation including certain postal regulation and licensing requirement that restrict make difficult and sometimes prohibit the ability of foreign owned company such fedex express to compete effectively in part of the international domestic transportation and logistics market regulatory or executive action affecting global aviation or transportation right or failure to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right in important international market could impair our ability to operate our network further our ability to obtain or maintain aviation or other transportation right internationally may be adversely affected by change in international trade policy and relation we are subject to other extensive regulatory and legal compliance requirement that may result in significant cost for instance the faa from time to time issue directive and other regulation relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditure in order to comply high profile accident catastrophe or incident involving aircraft may trigger increased regulatory and legal compliance requirement these requirement can be issued with little or no notice or can otherwise impact our ability to efficiently or fully utilize our aircraft and in some instance have resulted in the temporary grounding of aircraft type altogether further our business may be adversely impacted when government agency cease to operate expected including due to partial shutdown sequestration or similar event which may result in among other thing disruption in the ability of government agency to grant required regulatory approval for additional discussion see part item of this annual report under the caption regulation we may be affected by global climate change or by legal regulatory or market response to such change concern over climate change including the impact of global warming ha led to significant and international legislative and regulatory effort to limit greenhouse gas ghg emission including our aircraft and vehicle engine emission increasingly state and local government are also considering ghg regulatory requirement compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various country and region are following different approach to the regulation of climate change increased regulation regarding ghg emission especially aircraft or vehicle engine emission could impose substantial cost on especially at fedex express these cost include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital cost associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicle prematurely until the timing scope and extent of such possible regulation becomes known we can not predict it effect on our cost structure or our operating result it is reasonably possible however that it could materially increase our operating expense and have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business if instituted for additional discussion of regulatory response to climate change including the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation and the paris climate accord see part item of this annual report under the caption regulation moreover even without such regulation increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the ghgs emitted by company in the airline and transportation industry could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our service especially our air express service finally given the broad and global scope of our operation and our susceptibility to global macroeconomic trend we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risk of climate change that could affect all of humankind such shift in weather pattern and world ecosystem increasing cost the volatility of cost and funding requirement and other legal mandate for employee benefit especially pension and healthcare benefit could adversely impact our result of operation financial condition and liquidity we sponsor program that provide retirement benefit to most of our employee these program include defined benefit pension plan defined contribution plan and postretirement healthcare plan the cost of providing pension and other retirement benefit plan are dependent on numerous assumption such discount rate expected long term investment return on plan asset future salary increase employee turnover mortality retirement age government regulation and the frequency and amount of our required or voluntary contribution made to the plan change in actuarial assumption and difference between the assumption and actual value well significant decline in the value of investment that fund our pension and other postretirement plan if not offset or mitigated by decline in plan liability could increase pension and other postretirement expense and we could be required from time to time to fund the pension plan with significant amount of cash such cash funding obligation could adversely affect our result of operation and liquidity additionally the rule for pension and retirement benefit plan accounting are complex involve numerous assumption and can produce volatility in our result of operation financial condition and liquidity for example our fourth quarter mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment resulted in pre tax noncash million loss million net of tax or per diluted share for additional information on our mtm retirement plan accounting adjustment see management discussion and analysis of result of operation and financial condition result of operation and outlook consolidated result retirement plan mtm adjustment and note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement our inability to quickly and effectively restore operation following adverse weather or localized disaster or disturbance in key geography could adversely impact our business and result of operation while we operate several integrated network with asset distributed throughout the world there are concentration of key asset within our network that are exposed to adverse weather condition or localized risk from natural or manmade disaster such earthquake volcano wildfire hurricane conflict or unrest terrorist attack or other disturbance actual or threatened additionally shift in weather pattern caused by climate change could increase the frequency severity or duration of certain adverse weather condition prolonged interruption or disruption at key location such our fedex express memphis world hub or one of our information technology center could adversely impact our business and result of operation we also may incur significant cost to reestablish or relocate these function moreover resulting economic dislocation including supply chain and fuel disruption could adversely impact demand for our service resulting in an adverse effect on our business and result of operation

autonomous delivery device designed to help retailer make same day and last mile delivery to their customer and in we announced our collaboration with two business partner to launch pilot drone delivery service to explore method of enhancing last mile residential delivery service autonomous delivery is new and evolving market which make it difficult to predict it acceptance growth the magnitude and timing of necessary investment and other trend this aspect of our business strategy is subject to variety of risk inherent with the development of new technology including the ability to continue to develop autonomous delivery software and hardware access to sufficient capital our ability to develop and maintain necessary partnership risk related to the manufacture of autonomous device and significant competition from other company some of which may have more resource and capital to devote to autonomous technology than we do in addition we face risk related to the commercial deployment of autonomous delivery device on our targeted timeline or at all including consumer acceptance achievement of adequate safety and other performance standard and compliance with uncertain evolving and potentially conflicting federal and state regulation to the extent accident cybersecurity breach or other adverse event associated with our autonomous delivery device occur we could be subject to liability government scrutiny further regulation and reputational damage any of the foregoing could adversely impact our result of operation financial condition and growth prospect constraint volatility or disruption in the capital market our failure to maintain our current credit rating commercial paper rating and senior unsecured debt credit rating or our inability to meet credit agreement financial covenant could adversely affect our liquidity increase our interest expense and limit our financing option our ability to obtain financing depends on variety of factor such economic and market condition the regulatory environment for bank and other financial institution the availability of credit our credit rating and our reputation with potential lender historically we have relied on the public debt capital market to fund portion of our capital investment and other expenditure and access to the commercial paper market part of our working capital management strategy our continued access to these market and the term of such access depend on multiple factor including the condition of the debt capital market our operating performance and our credit rating standard poor ha assigned senior unsecured debt credit rating of bbb commercial paper rating of and rating outlook of negative moody investor service ha assigned an unsecured debt credit rating of commercial paper rating of and rating outlook of negative these rating are based on number of factor including assessment of our financial strength and financial policy if our credit rating drop our interest expense may increase and our access to financing may become limited if our commercial paper rating drop below current level we may have difficulty utilizing the commercial paper market if our senior unsecured debt credit rating drop below investment grade our access to financing may become limited further if we are unable to maintain the ratio of debt to adjusted ebitda required by our credit agreement our access to financing could become limited in addition increased volatility or disruption in the debt capital market could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statement for additional information regarding recent amendment to the credit agreement including with respect to the debt to adjusted ebitda covenant change in our access to one or more of these source of capital may reduce our ability to access other source of capital and financing adversely affecting our business operation and liquidity without

reclassification certain reclassification have been made to the prior year consolidated financial statement to conform to the current year presentation principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statement include the account of fedex and it subsidiary substantially all of which are wholly owned all significant intercompany account and transaction have been eliminated in consolidation revenue recognition satisfaction of performance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap to determine the proper revenue recognition method for contract we evaluate whether two or more contract should be combined and accounted for one single contract and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for more than one performance obligation for most of our contract the customer contract with to provide distinct service within single contract primarily transportation service substantially all of our contract with customer for transportation service include only one performance obligation the transportation service themselves however if contract is separated into more than one performance obligation we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of the promised good or service underlying each performance obligation we frequently sell standard transportation service with observable standalone sale price in these instance the observable standalone sale are used to determine the standalone selling price for transportation service revenue is recognized over time we perform the service in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer our customer receive the benefit of our service the good are transported from one location to another if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed control transfer over time revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation the selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the product or service to be provided we use the cost to cost measure of progress for our package delivery contract because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs we incur cost on our contract under the cost to cost measure of progress the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of cost incurred to date to the total estimated cost at completion of the performance obligation revenue including ancillary or accessorial fee and reduction for estimated customer incentive is recorded proportionally cost are incurred cost to fulfill include labor and other direct cost and an allocation of indirect cost for our freight and freight forwarding contract an output method of progress based on time in transit is utilized the timing of cost incurred doe not best depict the transfer of control to the customer we also provide customized customer specific solution such supply chain management solution and inventory and service part logistics through which we provide the service of integrating complex set of task and component into single capability for these arrangement the majority of which are conducted by our fedex logistics inc fedex logistics operating segment the entire contract is accounted for one performance obligation for these performance obligation we typically have right to consideration from customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of our performance completed to date and such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have right to invoice the customer fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement contract modification contract are often modified to account for change in the rate we charge our customer or to add additional distinct service we consider contract modification to exist when the modification either creates new enforceable right and obligation or alters the existing arrangement contract modification that add distinct good or service are treated separate contract contract modification that do not add distinct good or service typically change the price of existing service these contract modification are accounted for prospectively the remaining performance obligation are distinct variable consideration certain contract contain customer incentive guaranteed service refund and other provision that can either increase or decrease the transaction price these incentive are generally awarded based upon achieving certain performance metric we estimate variable consideration the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled we include estimated amount of revenue which may be reduced by incentive or other contract provision in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved our estimate of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amount in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information historical current and forecasted that is reasonably available to principal agent consideration transportation service are provided with the use of employee and independent business that contract with fedex gaap requires to evaluate whether our business themselves promise to transfer service to the customer the principal or to arrange for service to be provided by another party the agent using control model based on our evaluation of the control model we determined that fedex is the principal to the transaction for most of these service and revenue is recognized on gross basis based on the transfer of control to the customer cost associated with independent business providing transportation service are recognized incurred and included in the caption purchased transportation in the accompanying consolidated statement of income our contract logistics global trade service and certain transportation business engage in certain transaction wherein they act agent revenue from these transaction is recorded on net basis net revenue includes billing to customer le third party charge including transportation or handling cost fee commission and tax and duty contract asset and liability contract asset include billed and unbilled amount resulting from in transit shipment we have an unconditional right to payment only once all performance obligation have been completed package have been delivered contract asset are generally classified current and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction our contract liability consist of advance payment and billing in excess of revenue the full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short term nature of the transaction gross contract asset related to in transit shipment totaled million and million at may and may respectively contract asset net of deferred unearned revenue were million and million at may and may respectively contract asset are included within current asset in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet contract liability related to advance payment from customer were million and million at may and may respectively contract liability are included within current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet payment term certain of our revenue producing transaction are subject to tax such sale tax assessed by governmental authority we present these revenue net of tax under the typical payment term of our customer contract the customer pay at periodic interval every day day day etc for shipment included on invoice received it is not customary business practice to extend payment term past day and such we do not have practice of including significant financing component within our revenue contract with customer disaggregation of revenue see note for disclosure of disaggregated revenue for the period ended may this presentation is consistent with how we organize our segment internally for making operating decision and measuring performance fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement credit risk we routinely grant credit to many of our customer for transportation and business service without collateral the risk of credit loss in our trade receivables is substantially mitigated by our credit evaluation process short collection term and sale to large number of customer well the low revenue per transaction for most of our service allowance for potential credit loss are determined

value of an asset may not be recoverable for asset that are to be held and used an impairment is recognized when the estimated undiscounted cash flow associated with the asset or group of asset is le than their carrying value if impairment exists an adjustment is made to write the asset down to it fair value and loss is recorded the difference between the carrying value and fair value fair value are determined based on quoted market value discounted cash flow or internal and external appraisal applicable asset to be disposed of are carried at the lower of carrying value or estimated net realizable value we operate integrated transportation network so cash flow for most of our operating asset to be held and used are assessed at network level not at an individual asset level for our analysis of impairment in the second quarter of we made the decision to permanently retire from service airbus aircraft and related engine at fedex express to align with the need of the domestic

adjustment of our network capacity to match seasonality and overall customer demand level temporarily idled asset are classified available for use and we continue to record depreciation expense associated with these asset these temporarily idled asset are assessed for impairment and remaining life on quarterly basis the criterion for determining whether an asset ha been permanently removed from service and result is potentially impaired include but are not limited to our global economic outlook and the impact of our outlook on our current and projected volume level including capacity need during our peak shipping season the introduction of new fleet type or decision to permanently retire an aircraft fleet from operation and change to planned service expansion activity at may we

intangible net asset of business acquired several factor give rise to goodwill in our acquisition such the expected benefit from synergy of the combination and the existing workforce of the acquired business goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment in our evaluation of goodwill impairment we perform qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount if the qualitative assessment is not conclusive we proceed to test goodwill for impairment including comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to it carrying value including attributable goodwill fair value for our reporting unit is determined using an income or market approach incorporating market participant consideration and management assumption on revenue growth rate operating margin discount rate and expected capital expenditure fair value determination may include both internal and third party valuation unless circumstance otherwise dictate we perform our annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter see note for additional information intangible asset intangible asset primarily include customer relationship technology asset and trademark acquired in business combination intangible asset are amortized over period ranging from to year either on straight line basis or on basis consistent with the pattern in which the economic benefit are realized pension and postretirement healthcare plan our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plan are measured using actuarial technique that reflect management assumption for discount rate investment return on plan asset salary increase expected retirement mortality employee turnover and future increase in healthcare cost we determine the discount rate which is required to be the rate at which the projected benefit obligation pbo could be effectively settled of the measurement date with the assistance of actuary who calculate the yield on theoretical portfolio of high grade corporate bond rated aa or better with cash flow that are designed to match our expected benefit payment in future year we use the fair value of plan asset to calculate the expected return on asset eroa for interim and segment reporting purpose our eroa is judgmental estimate which is reviewed on an annual basis and revised appropriate fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement the accounting guidance related to employer accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan requires recognition in the balance sheet of the funded status of these plan we use mark to market or mtm accounting and immediately recognize change in the fair value of plan asset and actuarial gain or loss in our result annually in the fourth quarter each year the annual mtm adjustment is recognized at the corporate level and doe not impact segment result the remaining component of pension and postretirement healthcare expense primarily service and interest cost and the eroa are recorded on quarterly basis only service cost is recognized in segment level operating result income tax deferred income tax are provided for the tax effect of temporary difference between the tax basis of asset and liability and their reported amount in the financial statement the liability method is used to account for income tax which requires deferred tax to be recorded at the statutory rate expected to be in effect when the tax are paid deferred income tax asset represent amount available to reduce income tax payable on taxable income in future year such asset arise because of temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability well from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deduction and credit by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all source including reversal of taxable temporary difference forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategy these source of income rely heavily on estimate to make this determination and thus there is risk that these estimate will have to be revised new information is received to the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that deferred tax asset will be recovered valuation allowance is established we believe we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefit related to the remaining net deferred tax asset in our consolidated balance sheet that are not subject to valuation allowance we record the tax for global intangible low taxed income period cost we recognize liability for uncertain income tax position based on two step process the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit including resolution of related appeal or litigation process if any the second step requires to estimate and measure the tax benefit the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amount we must determine the probability of various possible outcome we reevaluate these uncertain tax position on quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management these reevaluation are based on factor including but not limited to change in fact or circumstance change in tax law successfully settled issue under audit and new audit activity such change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of tax benefit or an increase to the related provision we classify interest related to income tax liability interest expense and if applicable penalty are recognized component of income tax expense the income tax liability and accrued interest and penalty that are due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented current

use asset and lease liability the option to extend are not reasonably certain at lease commencement the lease liability are measured at the lease commencement date and determined using the present value of the minimum lease payment not yet paid and our incremental borrowing rate which approximates the rate at which we would borrow on collateralized basis over the term of lease in the applicable currency environment the interest rate implicit in the lease is generally not determinable in transaction where we are the lessee fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement for real

financial accounting standard board fasb issued new lease accounting standard which requires lessee to put most lease on their balance sheet but recognize the expense in their income statement in manner similar to current practice lessee are required to recognize lease liability for the obligation to make lease payment and right of use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term expense related to lease determined to be operating lease are recognized on straight line basis while those determined to be finance lease are recognized following front loaded expense profile in which interest and amortization are presented separately in the income statement fedex corporation note to consolidated financial statement we adopted this new standard on june using modified retrospective transition method under this approach we did not adjust the balance sheet for comparative period but recorded cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on june we have elected the package of practical expedient permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard which among other thing allows to carry forward the historical accounting relating to lease identification and classification for existing lease upon adoption we also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non lease component for the majority of our class of asset for lease in which the lease and non lease component have been combined the lease expense includes expense such common area maintenance we have made an accounting policy election not to recognize lease with an initial term of month or le on the consolidated balance sheet the adoption of the new lease accounting standard resulted in the recognition of an operating lease liability of billion and an operating right of use asset of billion with an immaterial impact on our income statement compared to the previous lease accounting model existing prepaid asset and net deferred rent liability balance of million and million respectively were recorded to the right of use asset the cumulative effect of the adoption to retained earnings wa an increase of million million net of tax primarily related to

entirely at the discretion of third party pension fund investment manager part of our strategy to manage pension cost and funded status volatility we follow liability driven investment strategy to better align plan asset with liability establishing the expected future rate of investment return on our pension asset is judgmental matter which we review on an annual basis and revise appropriate management considers the following factor in determining this assumption the duration of our pension plan liability which drive the investment strategy we can employ with our pension plan asset the type of investment class in which we invest our pension plan asset and the expected compound geometric return we can reasonably expect those investment class to earn over time net of all fee and

consolidated pension expense we assumed expected long term rate of return on our pension plan asset in and and in for the year period ended may our actual return wa net of all fee and expense the investment strategy for our pension plan asset is to utilize diversified mix of public equity and fixed income and alternative investment to earn long term investment return that meet our pension plan obligation our largest asset class are corporate fixed income security and government fixed income security which are largely benchmarked against the barclays long government barclays long corporate or the citigroup strip index and and non equity which are mainly benchmarked to the index and msci index accordingly we do not have any significant concentration of risk active management strategy are utilized within the plan in an effort to realize investment return in excess of market index our investment strategy also includes the limited use of derivative financial instrument on discretionary basis to improve investment return and manage portfolio risk the following is description of the valuation methodology used for investment measured at fair value cash and cash equivalent level
