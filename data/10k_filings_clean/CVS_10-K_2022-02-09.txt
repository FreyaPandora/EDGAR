state supreme court dismissed challenge on procedural ground that argued the aca is unconstitutional in it entirety and issued an opinion preserving the aca and it consumer protection in it current form even though the aca wa deemed constitutional there may nevertheless be continued effort to invalidate modify repeal or replace portion of it in addition to litigation part of the aca continue to evolve through the promulgation of executive order legislation regulation and guidance at the federal or state level the company expects the aca including potential change thereto to continue to significantly impact it business operation and operating result including pricing medical benefit ratio mbrs and the geography in which the company product are available medicare regulation the company medicare advantage product compete directly with original medicare and medicare advantage product offered by other medicare advantage organization and medicare supplement product offered by other insurer the company medicare pdp and medicare supplement product are product that medicare beneficiary who are enrolled in original medicare purchase to enhance their original medicare coverage the company continues to expand the number of county in which it offer medicare product the company ha expanded it medicare service area and product in and is seeking to substantially grow it medicare membership revenue and operating result over the next several year including through growth in medicare supplement product the anticipated organic expansion of the medicare service area and medicare

regulation of the various medicare program in which the company participates including change in the amount payable to under those program and or new reform or surcharge on existing program for example the aca requires minimum mlrs for medicare advantage and medicare part plan of if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay minimum mlr rebate for three consecutive year it will become ineligible to enroll new member if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay such rebate for five consecutive year it will be terminated by cm of contentsdue to potential lower utilization of medical service by medicare beneficiary during the covid pandemic it is possible certain medicare advantage contract may not meet the mlr for consecutive year the company medicare advantage and pdp product are heavily regulated by cm the regulation and contractual requirement applicable to the company and other private participant in medicare program are complex expensive to comply with and subject to change for example the medicare advantage overpayment rule issued in implemented the aca requirement that medicare advantage and pdp plan report and refund to cm overpayment that those plan receive from cm failure to notify overpayment to cm could result in liability under the false claim act the precise interpretation impact and legality of this rule are subject to pending litigation

adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the department of justice the doj the office of the inspector general of the hhs the oig and cm itself substantial change in the risk adjustment mechanism including change that result from enforcement or audit action could materially affect the amount of the company medicare reimbursement require the company to raise price or reduce the benefit offered to medicare beneficiary and potentially limit the company and the industry participation in the medicare program the company ha invested significant resource to comply with medicare

refuse to passively enroll member in one or more of the company medicare or medicare medicaid demonstration historically known dual eligible plan exclude from participating in one or more medicare dual eligible or dual eligible special need plan program and or institute other sanction and or civil monetary penalty against the company if it fails to comply with cm regulation or it medicare contractual requirement the company medicare supplement product are regulated at the state level and subject to similar significant compliance requirement and risk in addition in november the hhs released the final rebate rule the rebate rule which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the ak for rebate from pharmaceutical company to pbms in medicare part replacing it with two far narrower safe harbor designed to directly benefit patient with high out of pocket cost and to change the way pbms are compensated the new safe harbor are for rebate which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale and ii for flat service fee payment made to pbms which can not be tied to the list price of drug it is unclear whether the rebate rule will be enforceable whether pharmaceutical company will respond by reducing list price whether list price in the private market may also be reduced and the resulting impact will be to pbms or the company the pharmaceutical care management association the pcma which represents pbms ha filed suit in an effort to block the rebate rule claiming that the rebate rule would lead to higher premium in medicare part and wa adopted in an unlawful manner the bipartisan infrastructure act of delay the effective date of the rebate rule to january and pending reconciliation legislation would fully repeal the rebate rule in december president biden signed the protecting medicare and american farmer from sequester cut act the legislation extends the suspension of the medicare sequester cut march starting in april the medicare

contract with provider based on the medicare physician fee schedule will need to increase their payment rate by this increase became effective in january and doe not include any allowance for the increased medicare advantage cost that result from the provision taken together the two provision represent modest increase in medicare advantage cost relative to our expectation for currently congress is considering legislation to add additional benefit to medicare part such dental hearing and vision benefit the congressional budget office ha not yet scored any of the proposal going forward the company expects cm the oig the doj other federal agency and the congress to continue to scrutinize closely each component of the medicare program including medicare advantage pdps demonstration project such medicare medicaid plan and provider network access and adequacy modify the term and requirement of the program and possibly seek to recast or limit private insurer role it is also possible that congress may reform the structure of the medicare part program and may consider change to medicare advantage payment policy due to recent recommendation by the medicare payment advisory commission and to reduce the potential added cost burden of costly new of contentsbenefits or policy that impact drug pricing such price control and inflationary rebate applied to pharmaceutical manufacturer it is not possible to predict the outcome of such regulatory or congressional activity any of which could materially and adversely affect the company medicare audit cm regularly audit the company performance to determine it compliance with cm regulation and it contract with cm and to ass the quality of service it provides to medicare advantage and pdp beneficiary for example cm conduct risk adjustment data validation radv audit of subset of medicare advantage contract for each contract year since cm ha selected certain of the company medicare advantage contract for various year for radv audit and the number of radv audit continues to increase the oig also is auditing the company risk adjustment data and that of other company and the company expects

forward and gave notice that it ha extended the timeline for publication of the final rule until november while the company submitted timely comment to the proposed rule if they are adopted proposed there may be potential adverse effect which could be material on the company operating result financial condition and cash flow cm also ha announced that it goal is to subject all medicare advantage contract to either comprehensive or targeted radv audit for each contract year medicare star rating portion of each medicare advantage plan reimbursement is tied to the plan star rating the star rating system considers variety of measure adopted by cm including quality of preventative service chronic illness management compliance and overall customer satisfaction only medicare advantage plan with an overall star rating of four or more star out of five star are eligible for quality bonus in their basic premium rate result the company medicare advantage plan operating result in and going forward will be significantly affected by their star rating the company star rating and past performance score are adversely affected by the compliance issue that arise each year in it medicare operation cm released the company star rating in october the company star rating will be used to determine which of it medicare advantage plan have rating of four star or higher and qualify for bonus payment in based on the company membership at december of the company medicare advantage member were in plan with star rating of at least star cm also give pdps star rating which affect each pdp enrollment medicare advantage and pdp plan that are rated le than three star for three consecutive year are subject to contract termination by cm cm continues to revise it star rating system to make it harder to achieve four star or more despite the company success in achieving high star rating and other quality measure and the continuation of it improvement effort there can be no assurance that it will be successful in maintaining or improving it star rating in future year accordingly the company medicare advantage plan may not be eligible for full level quality bonus which could adversely affect the benefit such plan can offer reduce membership and or reduce profit margin medicare benchmark rate in january cm issued it final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rate final medicare advantage rate resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rate of approximately this rate increase only partially offset the challenge the company face from the impact of the increasing cost of medical care including prescription medication and cm local and national coverage decision that require the company to pay for service and supply that are not factored into the company bid the federal government may seek to impose restriction on the configuration of pharmacy or other provider network for medicare advantage and or pdp plan or otherwise restrict the ability of these plan to alter benefit negotiate price or establish other term to improve affordability or maintain viability of product the company currently belief that the payment it ha received and will receive in the near term are adequate to justify the company continued participation in the medicare advantage and pdp program although there are economic and political pressure to continue to reduce spending on the program and this outlook could change drug pricing program the drug pricing program allows eligible covered entity to purchase prescription drug from manufacturer at steep discount and

frequently including the family first act the care act the american rescue plan act and mandated increase to the medical service we must pay for without corresponding increase in the premium we receive in our health care benefit insured product result of covid including legislative and or regulatory response to covid the premium we charge in our insured health care benefit product may prove to be insufficient to cover the cost of medical service delivered to our insured medical member which may increase significantly result of higher utilization rate of medical facility and service and other increase in associated hospital and pharmaceutical cost federal state and local governmental policy and initiative to reduce the transmission of covid including existing and new variant such mask and vaccination mandate restriction on large gathering and social distancing directive may not effectively combat the severity and or duration of the covid pandemic and have resulted in among other thing reduction in utilization that is discretionary the cancellation of elective medical procedure reduced customer traffic and front store sale in our retail pharmacy our customer being

result of our medical member not seeing their provider result of covid we are unable to implement clinical initiative to manage benefit cost and chronic condition of our medical member and appropriately document their risk profile in addition in response to covid during the first half of we began to offer our medical member expanded benefit coverage and became obligated by governmental action to provide other additional coverage this expanded benefit coverage continued to be provided without corresponding increase in the premium we receive in our insured health care benefit we also are taking action designed to help provide financial and administrative relief for the health care provider community such measure and any further step we take or are required to take to expand or otherwise modify the service delivered to our health care benefit member provide relief for the health care provider community or in connection with the relaxation of social distancing directive and other restriction on movement and economic activity intended to reduce the spread of covid including the potential for widespread testing and vaccination including booster component of lifting those measure could adversely impact our benefit cost mbr and operating result the various initiative we have implemented to slow and or reduce the impact of covid and the covid related support program we have put in place for our customer medical member and colleague have increased our operating expense and reduced the efficiency of our operation our operating result will continue to be adversely affected so long these initiative continue or if they are expanded in addition any adverse economic condition that could be caused by covid may have an adverse impact on our net investment income and the value of our investment portfolio the spread of covid or action taken to mitigate it spread could have material and adverse effect on our ability to operate our business effectively including

or public and private infrastructure including those caused by industry capacity constraint material availability global logistics delay and constraint arising from among other thing the transportation capacity of ocean shipping container and labor availability constraint could materially and adversely impact our business operation we have transitioned significant subset of our colleague to remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of covid have significant number of our third party service provider which may amplify certain risk to our business including an increased demand for information technology resource increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attack increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information about or our medical member or other third party and increased risk of business interruption the covid pandemic continues to evolve and the severity and duration of the pandemic and scope and intensity of the governmental response to it are unknown at this time we believe covid impact on our business operating result cash flow and or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geography impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic vaccination rate the severity of any new covid variant and whether vaccine are effective in combating them the pandemic impact on the and global economy and consumer behavior and health care utilization pattern and the timing scope and impact of any additional stimulus legislation well other federal state and local governmental response to the pandemic those primary driver are beyond our knowledge and control result the impact covid will have on our business operating result cash flow and or financial condition is uncertain but the impact could be adverse and material covid also may result in legal and regulatory proceeding investigation and claim against risk relating to our businesseswe may not be able to accurately forecast health care and other benefit cost which could adversely affect our health care benefit segment operating result there can be no assurance that future health care and other benefit cost will not exceed our projection result of covid the current economic environment is adverse and le predictable than recently experienced which ha caused and may continue to cause unanticipated and significant volatility in our health care and other benefit cost including covid related testing and vaccination and post acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health cost in january the president of the united state issued an executive order to support government effort to expand access availability and use of covid diagnostic screening and surveillance and addressed the cost of covid testing by facilitating covid testing free of charge to those who lack comprehensive health insurance and clarifying group health plan and health insurance issuer obligation to provide coverage for covid testing in january the hhs announced that commercial health insurer must cover the cost of up to eight rapid covid otc test kit per individual per day period in addition the timing of vaccine administration to the general public and related cost well the identification of new more infectious strain of the covid virus and whether the vaccine will be effective against such new strain are uncertain and may impact our mbr premium for our insured health care benefit product which comprised of our health care benefit revenue for are priced in advance based on our forecast of health care and other benefit cost during fixed premium period which is generally twelve month these forecast are typically developed several month before the fixed premium period begin are influenced by historical data and recent historical data in particular are dependent on our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trend and change in our member behavior and health care utilization pattern and medical claim submission pattern and require significant degree of judgment for example our revenue on medicare policy is based on bid submitted in june of the year before the contract year cost increase in excess of projection can not be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premium result our profit are particularly sensitive to the accuracy of our forecast of the increase in health care and other benefit cost that we expect to occur and our ability to anticipate and detect medical cost trend for those forecast include adjustment made to pricing based on prospective expectation for liability due to testing vaccine direct covid treatment and deferred care risk adjusted revenue ha been adjusted for deferred care and forecasted enrollment considers assumption about the economic environment though covid related impact remain uncertain during period when health care and other benefit cost utilization and or medical cost trend experience significant volatility and medical claim submission pattern are changing rapidly result of covid accurately detecting forecasting managing reserving and pricing for our and our self insured customer medical cost trend and incurred and future health care and other benefit cost is more challenging there can be no assurance regarding the accuracy of the health care or other benefit cost projection reflected in our pricing and our health care and other benefit cost including covid related testing and vaccination and post acute care skilled nursing facility and behavioral health cost are affected by covid and other external event over which we have no control even relatively small difference between predicted and actual health care and other benefit cost percentage of premium revenue can result in significant adverse change in our health care benefit segment operating result number of factor contribute to rising health care and other benefit cost including covid previously uninsured member entering the health care system change in member behavior and health care utilization pattern turnover in our membership additional government mandated benefit or other regulatory change including under the family first act the care act and the american rescue plan act change in the health status of our member the aging of the population and other changing demographic characteristic advance in medical technology increase in the number and cost of prescription drug including specialty pharmacy drug and ultra high cost drug and therapy direct to consumer marketing by drug manufacturer the increasing influence of social medium on our member health care utilization and other behavior change in health care practice and general economic condition such inflation and employment level in addition government imposed limitation on medicare and medicaid reimbursement to health plan and provider have caused the private sector to bear greater share of increasing health care and other benefit cost over time and future amendment to the aca that increase the uninsured population may amplify this problem other factor that affect our health care and other benefit cost include epidemic or other pandemic change result of the aca change to the aca and other change in the regulatory environment the evolution toward consumer driven business model new technology influenza related health care cost which may be substantial and higher than we expected cluster of high cost case health care provider and member fraud and numerous other factor that are or may be beyond our control for example the influenza season wa impacted by effort taken to reduce the spread of covid and the influenza season had an earlier than average start and had higher incidence of influenza than the influenza season our health care benefit segment operating result and competitiveness depend in large part on our ability to appropriately manage future health care and other benefit cost through underwriting criterion product design provider network configuration negotiation of favorable provider contract and medical management program our medical cost management program may not be successful and may have smaller impact on health care and benefit cost than we expect the factor described above may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage health care and other benefit cost which can adversely affect our competitiveness and operating result furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trend or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claim or reported claim that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future health care cost and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further amplify the extent of any adverse impact on our operating result these risk are particularly acute during period when health care and other benefit cost utilization and or medical cost trend experience significant volatility and medical claim submission pattern are changing rapidly result of covid such risk are further magnified by the aca and other existing and future legislation and regulation that limit our ability to price for our projected and or experienced increase in utilization and or medical cost trend there can be no assurance that future health care and other benefit cost will not exceed our projection adverse economic condition in the and abroad can materially and adversely impact our business operating result cash flow and financial condition and we do not expect these condition to improve in the near future adverse economic condition in the and abroad including those caused by covid can materially and adversely impact our business operating result cash flow and financial condition including in our pharmacy service segment by causing drug utilization to decline reducing demand for pbm service and adversely affecting the financial health of our pbm client in our retail ltc segment by causing drug utilization to decline changing consumer purchasing power preference and or spending pattern leading to reduced consumer demand for product sold in our store and adversely affecting the financial health of our ltc pharmacy customer by causing our existing customer to reduce workforce including due to business failure which would reduce our revenue the number of covered life in our pbm client and or the number of member our health care benefit segment serf by causing our client and customer and potential client and customer particularly those with the most employee or member and state and local government to force to compete more vigorously on factor such price and service including service discount and other performance guarantee to retain or obtain their business by causing customer and potential customer of our health care benefit and retail ltc segment to purchase fewer product and or product that generate le profit for than the one they currently purchase or otherwise would have purchased by causing customer and potential customer of our health care benefit segment particularly smaller employer and individual to forego obtaining or renewing their health and other coverage with in our health care benefit segment by causing unanticipated increase and volatility in utilization of medical and other covered service including covid related testing vaccination and behavioral health service by our medical member change in medical claim submission pattern and or increase in medical unit cost and or provider behavior each of which would increase our cost and limit our ability to accurately detect forecast manage reserve and price for our and our self insured customer medical cost trend and incurred and future health care and other benefit cost by increasing medical unit cost and causing change in provider behavior in our health care benefit segment hospital and other provider attempt to maintain revenue level in their effort to adjust to their own covid related and other economic challenge by weakening the ability or perceived ability of the issuer and or guarantor of the debt or other security we hold in our investment portfolio to perform on their obligation to which could result in default in those security and ha reduced and may further reduce the value of those security and ha created and may continue to create net realized capital loss for that reduce our operating result by weakening the ability of our customer including self insured customer in our health care benefit segment medical provider and the other company with which we do business well our medical member to perform their obligation to or causing them not to perform those obligation either of which could reduce our operating result by weakening the ability of our former subsidiary and or their purchaser to satisfy their lease obligation that we have guaranteed and causing the company to be required to satisfy those obligation by weakening the financial condition of other insurer including long term care insurer and life insurer which increase the risk that we will receive significant assessment for obligation of insolvent insurer to policyholder and claimant by causing over time inflation that could cause interest rate to increase and thereby increase our interest expense and reduce our operating result well decrease the value of the debt security we hold in our investment portfolio which would reduce our operating result and or adversely affect our financial condition furthermore reduction in workforce by our customer can cause unanticipated increase in the health care and other benefit cost of our health care benefit segment for example our business associated with member who have elected to receive benefit under consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act known cobra typically ha an mbr that is significantly higher than our overall commercial mbr each of our segment operates in highly competitive and evolving business environment and operating income in the industry in which we compete may decline each of our segment health care benefit pharmacy service which includes our pbm business and retail ltc operates in highly competitive and evolving business environment specifically competition increase in the geography in which we operate including competition from new entrant significant increase in price compression and or reimbursement pressure could occur and this could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive in our health care benefit segment we are seeking to substantially grow our medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan membership over the next several year in many instance to acquire and retain our government business we must bid against our competitor in highly competitive environment winning bid often are challenged successfully by unsuccessful bidder and may also be withdrawn or cancelled by the issuing agency customer contract in our health care benefit segment are generally for period of one year and our customer have considerable flexibility in moving between and our competitor one of the key factor on which we compete for customer especially in uncertain economic environment is overall cost we are therefore under pressure to contain premium price increase despite being faced with increasing health care and other benefit cost and increasing operating cost if we are unable to increase our price to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing cost our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose member to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and operating result in response to rising price our customer may elect to self insure or to reduce benefit in order to limit increase in their benefit cost alternatively our customer may purchase different type of product from that are le profitable such election may result in reduced membership in our more profitable insured product and or lower premium for our insured product which may adversely affect our revenue and operating result although such election also may reduce our health care and other benefit cost in addition our medicare medicaid and chip product are subject to termination without cause periodic re bid rate adjustment and program redesign customer seek to contain their benefit cost particularly in an uncertain economy and our exposure to this risk is increasing we grow our government product membership these action may adversely affect our membership revenue and operating result we requested increase in our premium rate in our commercial health care benefit business for and expect to request increase in those rate for and beyond in order to adequately price for projected medical cost trend required expansion of coverage and rating limit and significant assessment fee and tax imposed by federal and state government including result of the aca our rate also must be adequate to reflect the risk that our product will be selected by people with higher risk profile or utilization rate than the pool of participant we anticipated when we established pricing for the applicable product also known adverse selection particularly in small group commercial product these rate increase may be significant and thus heighten the risk of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the likelihood that our requested premium rate increase will be denied reduced or delayed which could lead to operating margin compression the competitive success of our pharmacy service segment is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with network pharmacy pbm client evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network the competitive success of our retail ltc segment and our specialty pharmacy operation is dependent on our ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with pbms and other payors on acceptable term the payors client evaluate adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network in our pbm business we maintain contractual relationship with brand name drug manufacturer that provide for purchase discount and or rebate on drug dispensed by pharmacy in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacy all or portion of which may be passed on to client manufacturer rebate often depend on pbm ability to meet contractual requirement including the placement of manufacturer product on the pbm formulary if we lose our relationship with one or more drug manufacturer or if the discount or rebate provided by drug manufacturer decline our operating result cash flow and or prospect could be adversely affected the pbm industry ha been experiencing price compression result of competitive pressure and increased client demand for lower price increased revenue sharing including sharing in larger portion of rebate received from drug manufacturer enhanced service offering and or higher service level marketplace dynamic and regulatory change also have adversely affected our ability to offer plan sponsor pricing that includes the use of retail differential or spread which could adversely affect our future profitability and we expect these trend to continue our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operation have been affected by reimbursement pressure caused by competition including client demand for lower price generic drug pricing earlier than expected generic drug introduction and network reimbursement pressure if we are unable to increase our price to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing cost our profitability will be adversely affected if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose customer to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and operating result shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate result of competition or otherwise could adversely affect our margin including the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards day prescription at retail and the ongoing shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription pbm client contract often are for period of approximately three year however pbm client may require early or periodic re negotiation of pricing prior to contract expiration pbm client are generally well informed can move between and our competitor and often seek competing bid prior to expiration of their contract we are therefore under pressure to contain price increase despite being faced with increasing drug cost and increasing operating cost if we are unable to increase our price to reflect or otherwise mitigate the impact of increasing cost our profitability will be adversely if we are unable to limit our price increase we may lose customer to competitor with more favorable pricing adversely affecting our revenue and operating result the operating result and margin of our ltc business are further affected by the increased effort of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangement and by the financial health of and purchase and sale of our ltc customer in addition competitor in each of our business may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer competition also may come from new entrant and other source in the future unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our client through innovative product and service offering in the rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive disruptive innovation by existing or new competitor could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require to accurately identify and ass such alteration and make timely and effective change to our strategy and business model to compete effectively for example decision to buy our health care benefit and pharmacy service product and service increasingly are made or influenced by consumer either through direct purchasing medicare advantage plan and pdps or through public exchange and private health insurance exchange that allow individual choice consumer also are increasingly seeking to access consumer good and health care product and service locally and through other direct channel such mobile device and website to compete effectively in the consumer driven marketplace we will be required to develop or acquire new capability attract new talent and develop new service and distribution relationship that respond to consumer need and preference change in marketplace dynamic or the action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance and decision to exclude from new narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network could materially and adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and or prospect we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully on public exchange or that our pricing or other action will result in the profitability of our public exchange product in january we entered into the public exchange in eight state to compete effectively on public exchange we have developed or acquired the technology system tool and talent necessary to interact with public exchange and engage public exchange consumer through enhanced consumer focused sale marketing channel and customer interface we have also created new customer service program and product offering while participating on the public exchange we will have to respond to pricing and other action taken by existing competitor and regulator well potentially disruptive new entrant which could reduce our profit margin due to the price transparency provided by public exchange when we market product we face competitive pressure from existing and new competitor who may have lower cost structure our competitor may bring their public exchange and other consumer product to market more quickly have greater experience marketing to consumer and or may be targeting the higher margin portion of our business we can provide no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully or profitably on public exchange or that we will be able to benefit from any opportunity presented by public exchange in addition there can be no assurance that our pricing or other action will result in the profitability of our public exchange product in or any future year we have set premium rate for our public exchange product based on our projection including to the health status and quantity of membership and utilization of medical and or other covered service by member the accuracy of the projection reflected in our pricing may be impacted by adverse selection among individual who require or utilize more expensive medical and or other covered service ii other plan withdrawal from participation in the public exchange we serve and iii legislation regulation enforcement activity and or judicial decision that cause public exchange to operate in manner different than what we projected in setting our premium rate change in our health care benefit product mix may adversely affect our profit margin our insured health care benefit product that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than our asc product historically smaller employer group have been more likely to purchase insured health care benefit product because such purchaser are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for health care expenditure although over the last several year even relatively small employer have moved to asc product we also serve and expect to grow our business with government sponsored program including medicare and medicaid that are subject to competitive bid and have lower profit margin than our commercial insured health care benefit product shift of enrollee from more profitable product to le profitable product could have material adverse effect on the health care benefit segment operating result public perception of the industry in which we operate or of our industry or our practice can adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and prospect our brand and reputation are two of our most important asset and the industry in which we operate have been and are negatively perceived by the public from time to time negative publicity may come result of adverse medium coverage litigation against and other industry participant the ongoing public debate over drug pricing pbms government involvement in drug pricing and purchasing change to the aca surprise medical bill governmental hearing and or investigation actual or perceived shortfall regarding our industry or our own product and or business practice including pbm operation drug pricing and insurance coverage determination and social medium and other medium relation activity negative publicity also may come from failure to meet customer expectation for consistent high quality and accessible care this risk may increase we continue to offer product and service that make greater use of data and our business model becomes more focused on delivering health care to consumer in addition by working with the government in the distribution and administration of the covid vaccine the company may be subject to negative publicity related to the government action in response to covid that are outside of the ability of the company to control negative public perception and or publicity of our industry in general or of or our key vendor broker or product distribution network in particular can further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our operating result and our stock price by adversely affecting our brand and reputation adversely affecting our ability to market and sell our product and or service and or retain our existing customer and member requiring to change our product and or service reducing or restricting the revenue we can receive for our product and or service and or increasing or significantly changing the regulatory and legislative requirement with which we must comply we must maintain and improve our relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customer and increase the demand for our product and service including proprietary brand the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customer to frequent our retail store and online site and to purchase product in additional category and our proprietary brand failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preference and spending pattern and evolving demographic mix in the community we serve an inability to expand the product being purchased by our client and customer or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular category of product could adversely affect our relationship with our customer and client and the demand for our product and service and could result in excess inventory of product we offer our retail customer proprietary brand product that are available exclusively at our retail store and through our online retail site the sale of proprietary product subject to unique risk including potential product liability risk mandatory or voluntary product recall potential supply chain and distribution chain disruption for raw material and finished product our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property right and the right of applicable third party and other risk generally encountered by entity that source market and sell private label product we also face similar risk for the other product we sell in our retail operation including supply chain and distribution chain disruption risk any failure to adequately address some or all of these risk could have an adverse effect on our retail business operating result cash flow and or financial condition additionally an increase in the sale of our proprietary brand may adversely affect our sale of product owned by our supplier and adversely impact certain of our supplier relationship our ability to locate qualified economically stable supplier who satisfy our requirement and to acquire sufficient product in timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other thing that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationship with broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our operating result and erode customer loyalty we also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in marketplace dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication many of which are made available by manufacturer to limited number of pharmacy so called limited distribution drug that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of our pharmacy business depends largely upon expanding our access to key drug and penetration in certain treatment category any contraction of our base of patient or reduction in demand for the prescription we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our specialty pharmacy business operating result and cash flow we face risk relating to the availability pricing and safety profile of prescription drug that we purchase and sell the profitability of our retail ltc and pharmacy service segment is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug product we dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacy and the retail pharmacy in our pbm network also dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug our revenue operating result and cash flow may decline if physician cease writing prescription for drug or the utilization of drug is reduced including due to increased safety risk profile or regulatory restriction manufacturing or other supply issue reduction in drug manufacturer participation in federal program certain product being withdrawn by their manufacturer or transitioned to over the counter product future fda ruling restricting the supply or increasing the cost of product the introduction of new and successful prescription drug or lower priced generic alternative to existing brand name product or inflation in the price of drug in addition increased utilization of generic drug which normally yield higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand name drug ha resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payment to retail mail order specialty and ltc pharmacy for generic drug causing reduction in our margin on sale of generic drug consolidation within the generic drug manufacturing industry and other external factor may enhance the ability of manufacturer to sustain or increase pricing of generic drug and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced generic drug acquisition cost any inability to offset increased brand name or generic prescription drug acquisition cost or to modify our activity to lessen the financial impact of such increased cost could have significant adverse effect on our operating result the reserve we hold for expected claim in our insured health care benefit product are based on estimate that involve an extensive degree of judgment and are inherently variable any reserve including premium deficiency reserve may be insufficient if actual claim exceed our estimate our operating result could be materially adversely affected and our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future cost may be limited large portion of health care claim are not submitted to until after the end of the quarter in which service are rendered by provider to our member our reported health care cost payable for any particular period reflect our estimate of the ultimate cost of such claim well claim that have been reported to but not yet paid we also must estimate the amount of rebate payable under the mlr rule of the aca cm and the opm and the amount payable by to and receivable by from the united state federal government under the aca remaining premium stabilization program our estimate of health care cost payable are based on number of factor including those derived from historical claim experience but this estimation process also make use of extensive judgment considerable variability is inherent in such estimate and the accuracy of the estimate is highly sensitive to change in medical claim submission and processing pattern and or procedure turnover and other change in membership change in product mix change in the utilization of medical and or other covered service including prescription drug change in medical cost trend change in our medical management practice and the introduction of new benefit and product we estimate health care cost payable periodically and any resulting adjustment including premium deficiency reserve are reflected in current period operating result within benefit cost for example of december and we established premium deficiency reserve of million and million respectively related to medicaid product in the health care benefit segment worsening or improvement of health care cost trend rate or change in claim payment pattern from those that we assumed in estimating health care cost payable of december would cause these estimate to change in the near term and such change could be material furthermore if we are not able to accurately and promptly anticipate and detect medical cost trend or accurately estimate the cost of incurred but not yet reported claim or reported claim that have not been paid our ability to take timely corrective action to limit future health care cost and reflect our current benefit cost experience in our pricing process may be limited which would further exacerbate the extent of any adverse impact on our operating result these risk are particularly acute during and following period when utilization of medical and or other covered service and or medical cost trend are below historical level and in product where there is significant turnover in our membership each year and such risk are further magnified by the aca and other legislation and regulation that limit our ability to price for our projected and or experienced increase in utilization and or medical cost trend our operating result are affected by the health of the economy in general and in the geography we serve our business are affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general and in the geography we serve including various economic factor including inflation and change in consumer purchasing power preference and or spending pattern an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment could cause decline in drug utilization an increase in health care utilization and dampen demand for pbm service well consumer demand for product sold in our retail store if our customer operating and financial performance deteriorates or they are unable to make scheduled payment or obtain adequate financing our customer may not be able to pay timely or may delay payment of amount owed to any inability of our customer to pay for our product and service may adversely affect our business operating result and cash flow in addition both state and federal government sponsored payer result of budget deficit or spending reduction may suspend payment or seek to reduce their health care expenditure resulting in our customer delaying payment to or renegotiating their contract with further economic condition including interest rate fluctuation change in capital market condition and regulatory change may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable term our ability to secure suitable store location under acceptable term our ability to execute sale leaseback transaction under acceptable term and the value of our investment portfolio adverse change in the economy consumer confidence and economic condition could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result this adverse effect could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plan and health plan design favoring co insurance over co payment member and other consumer may decide to postpone or not to seek medical treatment which may lead them to incur more expensive medical treatment in the future and or decrease our prescription volume in addition our health care benefit membership remains concentrated in certain geography and in certain industry unfavorable change in health care or other benefit cost or reimbursement rate or increased competition in those geographic area where our membership is concentrated could therefore have disproportionately adverse effect on our health care benefit segment operating result our health care benefit membership ha been and may continue to be affected by workforce reduction by our customer due to adverse and or uncertain general economic condition especially in the geography and industry where our membership is concentrated result we may not be able to profitably grow and diversify our health care benefit membership geographically by product type or by customer industry and our revenue and operating result may be disproportionately affected by adverse change affecting our customer we are exposed to risk relating to the solvency of other insurer we are subject to assessment under guaranty fund law existing in all state for obligation of insolvent insurance company including long term care insurer hmo aca co ops and other payors to policyholder and claimant for example in the first quarter of aetna recorded discounted estimated liability expense of million pretax for our estimated share of future assessment for long term care insurer penn treaty network america insurance company and one of it subsidiary guaranty fund are maintained by state insurance commissioner to protect policyholder and claimant in the event that an insurer hmo aca co op and or other payor becomes insolvent or is unable to meet it financial obligation these fund are usually financed by assessment against insurer regulated by state future assessment may have an adverse effect on our operating result and cash flow extreme event or the threat of extreme event could materially impact our business and health care including behavioral health cost nuclear biological or other attack or other act of violence including active shooter situation whether result of war or terrorism or otherwise other man made disaster natural disaster such hurricane tropical storm flood fire earthquake tsunami cyclone typhoon or extreme weather condition such major or extended winter storm drought and tornado whether result of climate change or otherwise epidemic pandemic and other extreme event can affect the economy in general our industry and specifically in particular such extreme event or the threat of such extreme event could result in significant health care including behavioral health cost which also would be affected by the government action and the responsiveness of public health agency and other insurer such extreme event or the threat of extreme event also could disrupt our supply chain and or our distribution chain for the product we sell in addition our employee and those of our vendor are concentrated in certain large metropolitan area which may be particularly exposed to these event such event could adversely affect our business operating result and cash flow and in the event of extreme circumstance our financial condition or viability particularly if our response to such event are le adequate than those of our competitor we may be unable to achieve our environmental social and governance goal we are dedicated to corporate social responsibility and sustainability and face pressure from our colleague customer and stockholder to make significant advancement in environmental social and governance matter in part to address these concern we established certain goal part of our esg strategy achievement of our goal is subject to risk and uncertainty many of which are outside of our control and it is possible that we may fail to achieve these goal or that our colleague customer or stockholder might not be satisfied with our effort these risk and uncertainty include but are not limited to our ability to execute our operational strategy and achieve our goal within the currently projected cost and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of renewable energy and other material compliance with and change or addition to global and regional regulation tax charge mandate or requirement relating to climate related goal labor related regulation and requirement that restrict or prohibit our ability to impose requirement on third party contractor the action of competitor and competitive pressure an acquisition of or merger with another company that ha not adopted similar goal or whose progress towards reaching it goal is not advanced and the pace of regional and global recovery from the covid pandemic failure to meet our goal could adversely affect public perception of our business employee morale or customer or stockholder support further an increasing percentage of colleague customer and stockholder considers sustainability factor in making employment consumer health care and investment decision if we are unable to meet our goal we may lose colleague and have difficulty recruiting new colleague investor customer or partner our stock price may be negatively impacted our reputation may be negatively affected and it may be more difficult for to compete effectively all of which would have an adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition risk from change in public policy and other legal and regulatory riskswe are subject to potential change in public policy law and regulation including reform of the health care system which can adversely affect our business entitlement program reform if it occurs could have material adverse effect on our business operation and or operating result the political environment in which we operate remains uncertain it is reasonably possible that our business operation and operating result could be materially adversely affected by legislative regulatory and public policy change at the federal or state level increased government involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing and or importation and or increased regulation of pbms including change to the regulatory environment for health care and related benefit including medicare the aca and related public exchange regulation change to law or regulation governing drug reimbursement and or pricing change to the law and regulation governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program change to law and or regulation governing drug manufacturer rebate change to law and or regulation governing reimbursement paid to pharmacist by and or reporting required by pbms change to immigration policy and or other public policy initiative it is not possible to predict whether or when any such change will occur or what form any such change may take including through the use of presidential executive order other significant change to health care and related benefit system legislation or regulation well change with respect to tax and trade policy tariff and other government regulation affecting trade between the united state and other country also are possible and could adversely affect our business if we fail to respond adequately to such change including by implementing strategic and operational initiative or do not respond effectively our competitor our business operation and operating result may be materially adversely affected effort to amend the aca and related regulation are possible it is also possible that federal and state government will continue to enact and seriously consider many broad based legislative and regulatory proposal that will or could materially impact various aspect of the health care and related benefit system and our business further change to federal health care and related benefit law including the aca drug reimbursement and pricing law law governing pbms and or law governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program are probable we can not predict the effect if any that new health care and related benefit legislation future change to the aca or the implementation of or failure to implement the outstanding provision of aca may have on our health care benefit pharmacy service and or retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy operation and or operating result the federal and many government also are considering change in the interpretation enforcement and or application of existing program law and regulation including change to payment under and funding of medicare and medicaid program and increased regulation of pbms further change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to additional regulation of pbms including network restriction formulary management affiliate reimbursement contractual guarantee and reconciliation or other pbm service drug pricing or purchasing patent term extension and or purchase discount and or rebate arrangement with drug manufacturer also could reduce the discount or rebate we receive change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to claim processing and billing including our ability to use mac list and collect transmission fee also could adversely affect our profitability for example on october the hhs released final rule requiring health insurer to disclose drug pricing and cost sharing information the final rule requires group health plan and health insurance issuer in the individual and group market to disclose cost sharing information upon request to participant beneficiary or enrollee which unless otherwise indicated for the purpose of the final rule includes an authorized representative and requires plan and issuer to disclose in network provider rate historical out of network allowed amount and the associated billed charge and negotiated rate for prescription drug while the specific regulation requiring pbms to disclose negotiated price concession wa paused under federal guidance released in august if it resurfaces the regulation may result in drug manufacturer lowering discount or rebate resulting in higher drug cost for patient and impacting the ability of the company to negotiate drug price and provide competitive product and service to consumer in addition in november the hhs released the rebate rule which eliminates the regulatory safe harbor from prosecution under the ak for rebate from pharmaceutical company to pbms in medicare part and in medicaid mcos replacing it with two far narrower safe harbor designed to directly benefit patient with high out of pocket cost and to change the way pbms are compensated the new safe harbor are for rebate which are passed on to the patient at the point of sale and ii for flat service fee payment made to pbms which can not be tied to the list price of drug the pcma which represents pbms ha filed suit in an effort to block the rebate rule claiming that the rebate rule would lead to higher premium in medicare part and wa adopted in an unlawful manner it is unclear whether the rebate rule will be enforceable whether pharmaceutical company will respond by reducing list price whether list price in the private market may also be reduced and what the resulting impact will be to pbms or the company the bipartisan infrastructure act of delay the effective date of the rebate rule to january and pending reconciliation legislation would fully repeal the rebate rule additionally the consolidated appropriation act of wa signed into law in december and contains transparency provision requiring group health plan and health insurance issuer to report certain prescription drug cost overall spending on health service and prescription drug and information about premium and the impact of rebate and other remuneration on premium and out of pocket cost to the tri department no later than month after the first submission and bi annually thereafter the tri department will release public report on drug pricing trend drug reimbursement and the impact of drug price on premium in august the tri department deferred enforcement of both the december deadline for reporting plan year data and the june deadline for reporting plan year data to december we can not predict the enactment or content of new legislation or regulation or change to existing law or regulation or their enforcement interpretation or application or the effect they will have on our business operation or operating result which could be materially adverse even if we could predict such matter it is not possible to eliminate the adverse impact of public policy change that would fundamentally change the dynamic of one or more of the industry in which we compete example of such change include the federal or one or more state government fundamentally restructuring or reducing the funding available for medicare medicaid dual eligible or dual eligible special need plan program increasing it involvement in drug reimbursement pricing purchasing and or importation changing the law and regulation governing pbms pdps and or managed medicaid organization interaction with government funded health care program changing the tax treatment of health or related benefit or significantly altering the aca the likelihood of adverse change remains high due to

for see legal and regulatory proceeding in note commitment and contingency included in item of this for additional information our litigation and regulatory risk profile are changing we offer new product and service and expand in business area beyond our historical core business of health care benefit pharmacy service and retail ltc historically we focused primarily on providing health care benefit pharmacy service and retail ltc product and service result of our transformation program and other innovation initiative we are expanding our presence in the health care space and plan to offer new product and service such the home hemodialysis device we are developing which present different litigation and regulatory risk profile than the product and service that we historically have offered the increased volume of business in area beyond our historical core business and new product and service subject to litigation and regulatory risk that are different from the risk of providing health care benefit pharmacy service and retail ltc product and service and increase significantly our exposure to other risk we face unique regulatory and other challenge in our medicare and medicaid business we are seeking to substantially grow the medicare and medicaid membership in our health care benefit segment in and over the next several year we face unique regulatory and other challenge that may inhibit the growth and profitability of those business in january cm issued it final notice detailing final medicare advantage benchmark payment rate final medicare advantage rate resulted in an increase in industry benchmark rate of approximately we can not predict future medicare funding level the impact of future federal budget action or ensure that such change or action will not have an adverse effect on our medicare operating result the organic expansion of our medicare advantage and medicare part service area is subject to the ability of cm to process our request for service area expansion and our ability to build cost competitive provider network in the expanded service area that meet applicable network adequacy requirement cm decision on our request for service area expansion also may be affected adversely by compliance issue that arise each year in our medicare operation cm regularly audit our performance to determine our compliance with cm regulation and our contract with cm and to ass the quality of the service we provide to our medicare member result of these audit we may be subject to significant or material retroactive adjustment to and or withholding of certain premium and fee fine criminal liability civil monetary penalty cm imposed sanction including suspension or exclusion from participation in government program or other restriction on our

our revenue operating result and cash flow may be significantly adversely affected payment we receive from cm for our medicare advantage and medicare part business also are subject to risk adjustment based on the health status of the individual we enroll element of that risk adjustment mechanism continue to be challenged by the doj the oig and cm itself substantial change in the risk adjustment mechanism including change that result from enforcement or audit action could materially affect the amount of our medicare reimbursement require to raise price or reduce the benefit we offer to medicare beneficiary and potentially limit our and the industry participation in the medicare program change to the ability of pbms to have pharmacy performance program in place for client and report payment via direct and indirect reporting mechanism could impact the pharmacy service business medicare part ha resulted in increased utilization of prescription medication and put pressure on our pharmacy gross margin rate due to regulatory and competitive pressure further result of the aca and change to the retiree drug subsidy rule client of our pbm business could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible member to the extent this phenomenon occurs the adverse effect of increasing customer migration into medicare part may outweigh the benefit we realize from growth of our medicare part product our medicare part operating result and our ability to expand our medicare part business could be adversely affected if the cost and complexity of medicare part exceed management expectation or prevent effective program implementation or administration change to the regulation regarding how drug cost are reported for medicare part are implemented in manner that adversely affect the profitability of our medicare part business change to the applicable regulation impact our ability to retain fee from third party including network pharmacy the government alters medicare part program requirement or reduces funding because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayer of medicare part or for other reason the government mandated use of point of sale manufacturer rebate effective in continues the government enacts price control on certain pharmaceutical product in medicare part the government make change to how pharmacy pay for performance is calculated or reinsurance threshold are reduced below their current level we have experienced challenge in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data for our medicaid product due to difficulty with provider and third party vendor submitting claim in timely fashion in the proper format and with state agency in coordinating such submission state increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulty could affect the medicaid premium rate we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to which could have material adverse effect on our medicaid operating result and cash flow and or our ability to bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid program if we fail to report and correct error discovered through our own auditing procedure or during cm audit or otherwise fail to comply with the applicable law and regulation we could be subject to fine civil monetary penalty or other sanction including fine and penalty under the false claim act which could have material adverse effect on our ability to participate in medicare advantage medicare part or other government program and on our operating result cash flow and financial condition certain of our medicaid contract require the submission of complete and correct encounter data the accurate and timely reporting of encounter data is increasingly important to the success of our medicaid program because more state are using encounter data to determine compliance with performance standard and in part to set premium rate we have expended and may continue to expend additional effort and incur significant additional cost to collect accurate or to correct inaccurate or incomplete encounter data and have been and could be exposed to premium withholding operating sanction and financial fine and penalty for noncompliance we have experienced challenge in obtaining complete and accurate encounter data due to difficulty with provider and third party vendor submitting claim in timely fashion in the proper format and with state agency in coordinating such submission state increase their reliance on encounter data these difficulty could affect the medicaid premium rate we receive and how medicaid membership is assigned to which could have material adverse effect on our medicaid operating result and cash flow and or our ability to successfully bid for and continue to participate in certain medicaid program program funded in whole or in part by the federal government account for significant portion of our revenue and we expect that percentage to increase program funded in whole or in part by the federal government account for significant portion of our revenue and we expect that percentage to increase our government funded business grow our exposure to change in federal and state government policy with respect to and or regulation of the various government funded program in which we participate also increase the law and regulation governing participation in medicare advantage including dual eligible special need plan medicare part medicaid and managed medicaid plan are complex are subject to interpretation and can expose to penalty for non compliance federal state and local government have the right to cancel or not to renew their contract with on short notice without cause or if fund are not available funding for these program is dependent on many factor outside our control including general economic condition continuing government effort to contain health care cost and budgetary constraint at the federal or applicable state or local level and general political issue and priority the federal government and our other government customer also may reduce funding for health care or other program cancel or decline to renew contract with or make change that adversely affect the number of person eligible for certain program the service provided to enrollee in such program our premium and our administrative and health care and other benefit cost any of which could have material adverse effect on our business operating result and cash flow when federal funding is delayed suspended or curtailed we continue to receive and we remain liable for and are required to fund claim from provider for providing service to beneficiary of federally funded health benefit program in which we participate an extended federal government shutdown or delay by congress in raising the federal government debt ceiling also could lead to delay reduction suspension or cancellation of federal government spending and significant increase in interest rate that could in turn have material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio our ability to access the capital market and our business operating result cash flow and liquidity possible change in industry pricing benchmark and drug pricing generally can adversely affect our pbm and retail ltc business it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry regulator or federal policymakers may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace awp or wac which are the pricing reference used for many of our pbm and ltc client contract drug purchase agreement retail network contract specialty payor agreement and other contract with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payment in addition many state medicaid fee for service program have established pharmacy network payment on the basis of actual acquisition cost aac the use of an aac basis in fee for service medicaid could have an impact on reimbursement practice in health care benefit commercial and other government product it is also possible that congress may enact some limited form of price negotiation for medicare in addition cm also publishes the national average drug acquisition cost nadac for certain drug nadac pricing is being adopted in an increasing number of state future change to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmark used to establish drug pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health care program and or other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid program the reimbursement we receive from our pbm client and other payors and or our ability to negotiate rebate and or discount with drug manufacturer wholesaler pbms and retail pharmacy failure or inability to fully offset any increased price or cost or to modify our operation to mitigate the impact of such increase could have material adverse effect on our operating result additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection we can not predict the effect of these possible change on our business we may not be able to obtain adequate premium rate increase in our insured health care benefit product which would have an adverse effect on our revenue mbrs and operating result and could magnify the adverse impact of increase in health care and other benefit cost and of aca assessment fee and tax premium rate for our insured health care benefit product generally must be filed with state insurance regulator and are subject to their approval which creates risk for in the current political and regulatory environment the aca generally requires review by hhs in conjunction with state regulator of premium rate increase that exceed federally specified threshold or lower state specific threshold set by state determined by hhs to have adequate process rate review can magnify the adverse impact on our operating margin mbrs and operating result of increase in health care and other benefit cost increased utilization of covered service and aca assessment fee and tax by restricting our ability to reflect these increase and or these assessment fee and tax in our pricing further our ability to reflect aca assessment fee and tax in our medicare medicaid and chip premium rate is limited since hhs ha issued determination to health plan that their premium rate increase were unreasonable and we continue to experience challenge to appropriate premium rate increase in certain state regulator or legislature in several state have implemented or are considering limit on premium rate increase either by enforcing existing legal requirement more stringently or proposing different regulatory standard regulator or legislature in several state also have conducted hearing on proposed premium rate increase which can result and in some instance have resulted in substantial delay in implementing proposed rate increase even if they ultimately are approved our plan can be excluded from participating in small group public exchange if they are deemed to have history of unreasonable rate increase any significant rate increase we may request heighten the risk of adverse publicity adverse regulatory action and adverse selection and the that our requested premium rate increase will be denied reduced or delayed which could adversely affect our mbrs and lead to operating margin compression we anticipate continued regulatory and legislative action to increase regulation of premium rate in our insured health care benefit product we may not be able to obtain rate that are actuarially justified or that are sufficient to make our policy profitable in one or more product line or geography if we are unable to obtain adequate premium rate and or premium rate increase it could materially and adversely affect our operating margin and mbrs and our ability to earn adequate return on insured health care benefit product in one or more state or cause to withdraw from certain geography and or product minimum mlr rebate requirement limit the level of margin we can earn in our insured health care benefit product while leaving exposed to higher than expected medical cost challenge to our minimum mlr rebate methodology and or report could adversely affect our operating result the aca minimum mlr rebate requirement limit the level of margin we can earn in health care benefit commercial insured and medicare insured business cm minimum mlr rebate regulation limit the level of margin we can earn in our medicaid insured business certain portion of our health care benefit medicaid and fehb program business also are subject to minimum mlr rebate requirement in addition to but separate from those imposed by the aca minimum mlr rebate requirement leave exposed to medical cost that are higher than those reflected in our pricing the process supporting the management and determination of the amount of mlr rebate payable is complex and requires judgment and the minimum mlr reporting requirement are detailed cm ha also proposed but not yet finalized definition of prescription drug price concession for commercial mlr calculation purpose which would make additional pbm information available to plan and the hhs potentially further complicating the mlr calculation process federal and state auditor are challenging our commercial health care benefit business compliance with the aca minimum mlr requirement well our fehb plan compliance with opm fehb program specific minimum mlr requirement our medicare and medicaid contract also are subject to minimum mlr audit if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay minimum mlr rebate for three consecutive year it will become ineligible to enroll new member if medicare advantage or medicare part contract pay such rebate for five consecutive year it will be terminated by cm additional challenge to our methodology and or report relating to minimum mlr and related rebate by federal and state regulator and private litigant are reasonably possible the outcome of these audit and additional challenge could adversely affect our operating result our operating result may be adversely affected by change in law and policy governing employer and by union organizing activity congress and certain state legislature continue to consider and pas legislation that increase our cost of doing business including increased minimum wage and requiring employer to provide paid sick leave or paid family leave in addition our employee related operating cost may be increased by union organizing activity and it is possible that the national labor relation board may adopt regulatory change through re making or case law that could facilitate union organizing if we are unable to reflect these increased expense in our pricing or otherwise modify our operation to mitigate the effect of such increase our operating result will be adversely affected we face international political legal and compliance operational regulatory economic and other risk that may be more significant than in our domestic operation our international operation present political legal compliance operational regulatory economic and other risk that we do not face or that are more significant than in our domestic operation these risk vary widely by country and include varying regional and geopolitical business condition and demand government intervention and censorship discriminatory regulation climate change regulation nationalization or expropriation of

including the uk bribery act and similar law in other jurisdiction implementing our compliance policy internal control and other system upon our expansion into new country and geography may require the investment of considerable management time and financial and other resource over several year before any significant revenue or profit are generated violation of these law and regulation could result in fine criminal sanction against our officer or employee restriction or outright prohibition on the conduct of our business and significant brand and reputational harm we regularly reassess the size capability and location of our global infrastructure and make appropriate change and must have effective change management process and internal control in place to address change in our

international operation some of our operation are and are increasingly likely to be in emerging market where these risk are heightened any measure we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currency and other risk on our international operation may not be effective risk associated with merger acquisition and divestiture we may be unable to successfully integrate company we acquire upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the product service and related asset well internal control into our business operation if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business it product service and related asset into our company also may be complex and time consuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefit operating and cost synergy and or growth opportunity of an acquisition potential difficulty that may be encountered in the integration process include the following integrating personnel operation and system including internal control environment and compliance policy while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent high quality product and service coordinating geographically dispersed organization disrupting management attention from our ongoing business operation retaining existing customer and attracting new customer managing inefficiency associated with integrating our operation and reconciling post acquisition cost and liability between buyer and seller an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefit operating and cost synergy innovation and operation efficiency or growth opportunity of an acquisition well any delay or additional expense encountered in the integration process could have material adverse effect on our business and operating result furthermore acquisition even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy anticipated expose to increased competition or challenge with respect to our product service or service area and expose to additional liability associated with an acquired business including risk and liability associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenge or risk could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisition after we have expended resource on them we expect to continue to pursue acquisition

significant debt among other thing we expect to continue to pursue acquisition joint venture strategic alliance and other inorganic growth opportunity part of our growth strategy in addition to the integration risk noted above some other risk we face with respect to acquisition and other inorganic growth strategy include we frequently compete with other firm some of which may have greater financial and other resource and greater tolerance for risk to acquire attractive company the acquired alliance and or joint venture business may not perform projected the goodwill or other intangible asset established result of our acquisition may be incorrectly valued or may become impaired we may assume unanticipated liability including those that were not disclosed to or which we underestimated the acquired business or the pursuit of other inorganic growth strategy could disrupt or compete with our existing business distract management result in the loss of key employee divert resource result in tax cost or inefficiency and make it difficult to maintain our current business standard control information technology system policy procedure and performance we may finance future acquisition and other inorganic growth strategy by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price which would dilute the ownership interest of our stockholder we may incur significant debt in connection with acquisition whether to finance acquisition or by assuming debt from the business we acquire we may not have the expertise to manage and profitably grow the business we acquire and we may need to rely on the retention of key personnel and other supplier of business we acquire which may be difficult or impossible to accomplish we may enter into merger or purchase agreement but due to reason within or outside our control fail to complete the related transaction which could result in termination fee or other penalty that could be material cause material disruption to our business and operation and adversely affect our brand and reputation in order to complete proposed acquisition we may be required to divest certain portion of our business for which we may not be able to obtain favorable pricing we may be involved in litigation related to merger or acquisition including for matter that occurred prior to the applicable closing which may be costly to defend and may result in adverse ruling against that could be material and the integration into our business of the business and entity we acquire may affect the way in which existing law and regulation apply to

operation such call center operation pbm function retail pharmacy and ltc service retail mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription delivery claim processing customer case installation and online access and tool that meet or exceed our customer and member expectation either directly or through vendor we seek to reduce general and administrative expense we must balance the potential impact of cost saving measure on our customer and other service and performance if we misjudge the effect of such measure customer and other service may be adversely affected we depend on third party for certain of our customer service pbm and prescription delivery operation if we or our vendor fail to provide service that meet our customer and member expectation we may have difficulty retaining or profitably growing our customer base and or membership which could adversely affect our operating result for example noncompliance with any privacy or security law or regulation or any security breach

attack we can provide no assurance that we or our vendor will be able to detect prevent or contain the effect of such attack or other information security including cybersecurity risk or threat in the future we and our vendor have experienced diverse cyber attack and expect to continue to experience cyber attack going forward example the company and it vendor have experienced attempt to gain access to system denial of service attack attempted malware infection account takeover scanning activity and phishing email attack can originate from external criminal terrorist nation state or internal actor the company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resource and incur significant expense to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the system and process that are to mitigate the information security risk it face and protect the security of it computer system software network and other technology asset against attempt by unauthorized party to obtain access to confidential information disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage the impact of cyber attack ha not been material to the company operation or operating result through december the board and it audit committee and nominating and corporate governance committee are regularly informed regarding the company information security policy practice and status compromise of our information security control or of those business with whom we interact which result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper person could harm our reputation and expose to regulatory action and claim from customer and client financial institution payment card association and other person any of which could adversely affect our business operating result and financial condition because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may not immediately produce sign of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure moreover data security breach could require that we expend significant resource related to our information system and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duty we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the system of third party we interact with including key payors and vendor the cost of attempting to protect against the foregoing risk and the cost of responding to an information security incident are significant large scale data breach at other entity increase the challenge we and our vendor face in maintaining the security of our information technology system and proprietary information and of our customer

disintermediation risk we may be subject to penalty or other regulatory action result of the marketing practice of broker and agent selling our product our product are sold primarily through our sale personnel who frequently work with independent broker consultant and agent who assist in the production and servicing of business the independent broker consultant and agent generally are not dedicated to exclusively and may frequently recommend and or market health care benefit product of our competitor accordingly we must compete intensely for their service and allegiance our sale could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract retain or motivate sale personnel and third party broker consultant and agent or if we do not adequately provide support training and education to this sale network regarding our complex product portfolio or if our sale strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channel this risk is heightened we develop operate and expand our consumer oriented product and service and we expand in the health care space and our business model evolves to include greater focus on consumer and direct to consumer sale such competing for sale on insurance exchange distribution channel for our product and service continue to emerge including private exchange operated by health care consultant and technology company these channel may make it more difficult for to directly engage consumer and other customer in the selection and management of their health care benefit in health care utilization and in the effective navigation of the health

have been several investigation regarding the marketing practice of broker and agent selling health care and other insurance product and the payment they receive these investigation have resulted in enforcement action against company in our industry and broker and agent marketing and selling those company product for example cm and state department of insurance have increased their scrutiny of

customer member consumer and vendor in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion in addition recent trend toward greater consumer engagement in health care require new and enhanced technology including more sophisticated application for mobile device certain of our technology system including software are older legacy system that are le flexible le efficient and require significant ongoing commitment of capital and human resource to maintain protect and enhance them and to integrate them with our other system we must re engineer and reduce the number of these system to meet changing

our existing system to support the consumer oriented and transformation product and service we are developing operating and expanding and or to meet current developing industry and regulatory standard including to keep pace with continuing change in information processing technology and emerging cybersecurity risk and threat if we fail to achieve these objective our ability to profitably grow our business and or our operating result may be adversely affected in addition information technology and other technology and process improvement project including our transformation and enterprise modernization program frequently are long term in nature and may take longer to complete and cost more than we expect and may not deliver the benefit we project once they are complete if we do not

data security standard and certification requirement and rule governing electronic fund transfer these requirement may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment option including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and various other form of electronic payment if these vendor are unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised our operation could be disrupted the payment method that we offer also expose to potential fraud and theft by person seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness in the

future become impaired of december and december we had billion and billion respectively of goodwill and other intangible asset goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset are subject to annual impairment review or more frequent review if event or circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable when evaluating goodwill for potential impairment we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to their respective carrying amount we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit using combination of discounted cash flow method and market multiple method if the carrying amount of reporting unit exceeds it estimated fair value goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess to the extent of the goodwill balance indefinite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to it carrying value the company estimate the fair value of it indefinite lived trademark using the relief from royalty method under the income approach if the carrying value of the asset exceeds it estimated fair value an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to it estimated fair value definite lived intangible asset are tested for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable if indicator of impairment are present the company first compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flow associated with the asset group undiscounted if the estimated future cash flow used in this analysis are le than the carrying amount of the asset group an impairment loss calculation is prepared the impairment loss calculation compare the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group estimated future cash flow discounted estimated fair value could change if for example there are change in the business climate industry wide change change in the competitive environment adverse legal or regulatory action or development change in capital structure cost of debt interest rate capital expenditure level operating cash flow or market capitalization because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible asset any future impairment of these asset could require material noncash charge to our operating result which also could have material adverse effect on our financial condition adverse condition in the and global capital market can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment in debt and equity security mortgage loan alternative investment and other investment and our operating result and or our financial condition the global capital market including credit market continue to experience volatility and uncertainty an insurer we have substantial investment portfolio that support our policy liability and surplus and is comprised largely of debt security of issuer located in the result the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rate in the and to lesser extent the international financial market and volatility uncertainty and or disruption in the global capital market particularly the credit market and government monetary policy particularly monetary policy can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio our operating result and or our financial condition by significantly reducing the value and or liquidity of the debt security we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital loss that reduce our operating result and or unrealized capital loss that reduce our shareholder equity keeping interest rate low on high quality short term or medium term debt security such we have experienced during recent year and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating result the proceeds from security in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding security reducing the fair value of our investment if interest rate rise causing non performance of or default on their obligation to by third party including customer issuer of security in our investment portfolio mortgage borrower and or reinsurance and or derivative counterparties making it more difficult to value certain of our investment security for example if trading becomes le frequent which could lead to significant period to period change in our estimate of the fair value of those security and cause period to period volatility in our net income and shareholder equity reducing our ability to issue short term debt security at attractive interest rate thereby increasing our interest expense and decreasing our operating result and reducing our ability to issue other security although we seek within guideline we deem appropriate to match the duration of our asset and liability and to manage our credit and counterparty exposure failure adequately to do so could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and in extreme circumstance our cash flow risk related to our relationship with manufacturer provider supplier and vendorswe face risk relating to the market availability pricing supplier and safety profile of prescription drug and other product that we purchase and sell our retail ltc segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operation generate revenue in significant part by dispensing prescription drug our pbm business generates revenue primarily by contracting with client to provide prescription drug and related health care service to plan member result we are dependent on our relationship with prescription drug manufacturer and supplier we acquire substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier certain of our agreement with such supplier are short term and cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may allow the supplier to distribute through channel other than certain of these agreement also allow pricing and other term to be adjusted periodically for changing market condition or required service level termination or modification to any of these relationship could adversely affect our prescription drug supply and have material adverse effect on our business operating result and financial condition moreover many product distributed by our pharmacy are manufactured with ingredient that are susceptible to supply shortage in some case we depend upon single source of supply any such supply shortage or loss of any such single source of supply could adversely affect our operating result and cash flow much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our pharmacy and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united state in most case the product or merchandise are imported by others and sold to result significant change in tax or trade policy tariff or trade relation between the united state and other country such the imposition of unilateral tariff on imported product could result in significant increase in our cost restrict our access to supplier depress economic activity and have material adverse effect on our business operating result and cash flow in addition other country may change their business and trade policy and such change well any negative sentiment towards the united state in response to increased import tariff and other change in trade regulation could adversely affect our business our supplier are independent entity subject to their own operational and financial risk that are outside our control if our current supplier were to stop selling prescription drug to or delay delivery including result of supply shortage supplier production disruption supplier quality issue closing or bankruptcy of our supplier or for other reason we may be unable to procure alternative from other supplier in timely and efficient manner and on acceptable term or at all our operating result may be adversely affected if we are unable to contract with provider on competitive term and develop and maintain attractive network with high quality provider we are seeking to enhance our health care provider network by entering into joint venture and other collaborative risk sharing arrangement with provider provider willingness to enter these arrangement with depends upon among other thing our ability to provide them with up to date quality of care data to support these value based contract these arrangement are designed to give provider incentive to engage in population health management and optimize delivery of health care to our member these arrangement also may allow to expand into new geography target new customer group increase membership and reduce medical cost and if we provide technology or other service to the relevant health system or provider organization may contribute to our revenue and earnings from alternative source if such arrangement do not result in the lower medical cost that we project or if we fail to attract provider to such arrangement or are le successful at implementing such arrangement than our competitor our medical cost may not be competitive and may be higher than we project our attractiveness to customer may be reduced we may lose or be unable to grow medical membership and our ability to profitably grow our business and or our operating result may be adversely affected while we believe joint venture accountable care organization acos and other non traditional health care provider organizational structure present opportunity for the implementation of our joint venture and other non traditional structure strategy may not achieve the intended result which could adversely affect our operating result and cash flow other thing joint venture require to maintain collaborative relationship with our counterparties continue to gain access to provider rate that make the joint venture economically sustainable and devote significant management time to the operation and management of the joint venture we may not be able to achieve these objective in one or more of our joint venture which could adversely affect our operating result and cash flow if our supplier or service provider fail to meet their contractual obligation to or to comply with applicable law or regulation we may be exposed to brand and reputational harm litigation and or regulatory action this risk is particularly high in our medicare medicaid dual eligible and dual eligible special need plan program in addition to our supplier we contract with various third party to perform certain function and service and provide with certain information technology system our arrangement with supplier and these third party may expose to public scrutiny adversely affect our brand and reputation expose to litigation or regulatory action and otherwise make our operation vulnerable if we fail to adequately oversee monitor and regulate their performance or if they fail to meet their contractual obligation to or to comply with applicable law or regulation including those related to human capital and climate change for example certain of our vendor have been responsible for release of sensitive information of our member and employee which ha caused to incur additional expense and given rise to regulatory action and litigation against these risk are particularly high in our in medicare advantage including dual eligible special need plan medicare part medicaid and managed medicaid plan where third party may perform medical management and other member related service for any failure of our or these third party prevention detection or control system related to regulatory compliance compliance with our internal policy data security and or cybersecurity or any incident involving the theft misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of or access to member customer or other constituent sensitive information could require to expend significant resource to remediate any damage interrupt our operation and adversely affect our brand and reputation and also expose to whistleblower class action and other litigation other proceeding prohibition on marketing or active or passive enrollment of member corrective action fine sanction and or penalty any of which could adversely affect our business operating result cash flow and or financial condition we may experience increased medical and other benefit cost litigation risk and customer and member dissatisfaction when provider that do not have contract with render service to our health care benefit member some provider that render service to our health care benefit member do not have contract with in those case we do not have pre established understanding with these provider to the amount of compensation that is due to them for service rendered to our member in some state the amount of compensation due to these nonparticipating provider is defined by law or regulation but in most instance it is either not defined or it is established by standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar term in such instance provider may believe that they are underpaid for their service and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with or try to recover the difference between what we have paid them and the amount they charged from our member which may result in customer and member dissatisfaction for example in october an arbitrator awarded certain claimant hospital approximately million in proceeding relating to aetna out of network benefit payment and administration practice and in march that award wa reduced to approximately million such dispute may cause to pay higher medical or other benefit cost than we projected continuing consolidation and integration among provider and other supplier may increase our medical and other covered benefit cost make it difficult for to compete in certain geography and create new competitor hospital and other provider and health system continue to consolidate across the health care industry while this consolidation could increase efficiency and ha the potential to improve the delivery of health care service it also reduces competition and the number of potential contracting party in certain geography these health system also are increasingly forming and considering forming health plan to directly offer health insurance in competition with process that ha been accelerated by the aca in addition acos including commercial and medicaid only acos developed result of state medicaid law practice management company consolidation among and by integrated health system and other change in the organizational structure that physician hospital and other provider adopt continues to change the way these provider interact with and the competitive landscape in which we operate these change may increase our medical and other covered benefit cost may affect the way we price our product and service and estimate our medical and other covered benefit cost and may require to change our operation including by withdrawing from certain geography where we do not have significant presence across our business or are unable to collaborate or contract with provider on acceptable term each of these change may adversely affect our business and operating result of contentsitem unresolved staff comment there are no unresolved sec staff comment item property the company principal office is an owned

of and beyond the company utilized these updated projection in performing it annual impairment test which indicated that the fair value of the ltc reporting unit wa lower than it carrying value resulting in million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of the fair value of the ltc reporting unit wa determined using combination of discounted cash flow method and market multiple method subsequent to the impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of there is no remaining goodwill balance in the ltc reporting unit the company ha experienced decline in it commercial insured medical membership subsequent to the closing date of the aetna acquisition and may continue to do so for number of reason including result of the competitive commercial business environment in addition covid and the emerging new variant have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on medical membership in the commercial business due to reduction in workforce at existing customer including due to business failure well reduced willingness to change benefit provider by prospective customer the company fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumption including change in

make for service rendered to the company insured member but not yet reported to the company and ii claim which have been reported to the company but not yet paid each of the financial statement date collectively ibnr health care cost payable also include an estimate of the cost of service that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the company is obligated to pay for such service in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirement such estimate are developed using actuarial principle and assumption which consider among other thing historical and projected claim submission and processing pattern assumed and historical medical cost trend historical utilization of medical service claim inventory level change in insured membership and product mix seasonality and other relevant factor the company reflects change in these estimate in benefit cost in the company consolidated operating result in the period they are determined capitation cost represent contractual monthly fee paid to participating physician and other medical provider for providing medical care regardless of the volume of medical service provided to the insured member amount due under risk sharing arrangement are based on the term of the underlying contract with the provider and consider claim experience under the contract through the financial statement date the company develops it estimate of ibnr using actuarial principle and assumption that consider numerous factor of those factor the company considers the analysis of historical and projected claim payment pattern including claim submission and processing pattern and the assumed health care cost trend rate the year over year change in per member per month health care cost to be the most critical assumption in developing it ibnr estimate the company consistently applies these actuarial principle and assumption each period with consideration to the variability of related factor there have been no significant change to the methodology or assumption used to develop the company estimate of ibnr in the company analyzes historical claim payment pattern by comparing claim incurred date the date service were provided to claim payment date to estimate completion factor the company us completion factor predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claim incurred more than three month before the financial statement date the company estimate completion factor by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claim incurred for given month that are complete by each month thereafter for any given month substantially all claim are paid within six month of the date of service but it can take up to month or longer after the date of service before all of the claim are completely resolved and paid these historically derived completion factor are then applied to claim paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for given month incurred claim activity the difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claim paid through the financial statement date represents the company estimate of claim remaining to be paid of the financial statement date and is included in the company health care cost payable the completion factor the company us reflect judgment and possible adjustment based on data such claim inventory level claim submission and processing pattern and to lesser extent other factor such change in health care cost trend rate change in insured membership and change in product mix if claim are submitted or processed on faster slower pace than prior period the actual claim may be more le complete than originally estimated using the company completion factor which may result in reserve that are higher lower than the ultimate cost of claim because claim incurred within three month before the financial statement date are le mature the company us combination of historically derived completion factor and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claim incurred for these month the company applies it actuarial judgment and place greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred date these month may be influenced by seasonal pattern and change in membership and product mix the company health care cost trend rate is affected by change in per member utilization of medical service well change in the unit cost of such service many factor influence the health care cost trend rate including the company ability to manage benefit cost through product design negotiation of favorable provider contract and medical management program well the mix of the company business the health status of the company insured member aging of the population and other demographic characteristic advance in medical technology and other factor continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit cost change in health care practice inflation new technology increase in the cost of drug including specialty pharmacy drug direct to consumer marketing by pharmaceutical company cluster of high cost case claim intensity change in the regulatory environment health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factor also contribute to the cost of health care and the company health care cost trend rate for each reporting period the company us an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating it health care cost payable result considerable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimate particularly with respect to claim with claim incurred date of three month or le before the financial statement date and the adequacy of such estimate is highly sensitive to change in assumed completion factor and the assumed health care cost trend rate for each reporting period the company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care cost payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completion factor and health care cost trend rate well other factor the company belief it estimate of health care cost payable is reasonable and adequate to cover it obligation at december however actual claim payment may differ from the company estimate worsening or improvement of the company health care cost trend rate or change in completion factor from those that the company assumed in estimating health care cost payable at december would cause these estimate to change in the near term and such change could be material each quarter the company re examines previously established health care cost payable estimate based on actual claim payment for prior period and other change in fact and circumstance given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate it is possible that the company estimate of health care cost payable could develop either favorably that is it actual benefit cost for the period were le than estimated or unfavorably the change in the company estimate of health care cost payable may relate to prior quarter prior year or earlier period for roll forward of the company health care cost payable see note health care cost payable the company reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of it ultimate liability for health care cost payable

actuarial principle and assumption which consider among other thing contractual requirement claim incidence rate claim recovery rate seasonality and other relevant factor the company discount certain claim liability related to group long term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contract the discount rate generally reflect the company expected investment return for the investment supporting all incurral year of these liability the discount rate for retrospectively rated contract are set at contractually specified level the company estimate of unpaid claim are subject to change due to change in the underlying experience of the insurance contract change in investment yield or other factor and these change are recorded in current and future benefit in the consolidated statement of operation in the period they are determined the company estimate it reserve for claim ibnr for life product largely based on completion factor the completion factor used are based on the company historical experience and reflect judgment and possible adjustment based on data such claim inventory level claim payment pattern change in business volume and other factor if claim are submitted or processed on faster slower pace than historical period the actual claim may be more le complete than originally estimated using completion factor which may result in reserve that are higher lower than required to cover future life benefit payment there have been no significant change to the methodology or assumption used to develop the company estimate of unpaid claim ibnr in of

fair valuethe preparation of the company consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap requires certain asset and liability to be reflected at their fair value and others to be reflected on another basis such an adjusted historical cost basis in this note the company provides detail on the fair value of financial asset and liability and how it determines those fair value the company present this information for those financial instrument that are measured at fair value for which the change in fair value impact net income attributable to cv health or other comprehensive income separately from other financial asset and liability financial instrument measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheetscertain of the company financial instrument are measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet the fair value of these instrument are based on valuation that include input that can be classified within one of three level of hierarchy established by gaap the following are the level of the hierarchy and brief description of the type of valuation information valuation input that qualifies financial asset or liability for each level level unadjusted quoted price for identical asset or liability in active market level valuation input other than level that are based on observable market data these include quoted price for similar asset in active market quoted price for identical asset in inactive market valuation input that are observable that are not price such interest rate and credit risk and valuation input that are derived from or corroborated by observable market level developed from unobservable data reflecting the company assumption financial asset and liability are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the valuation when quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability are available the company us these quoted market price to determine the fair value of financial asset and liability and classifies these asset and liability in level in other case where quoted market price for identical asset and liability in an active market is either not available or not observable the company estimate fair value using valuation methodology based on available and observable market information or by using matrix pricing model these financial asset and liability are classified in level if quoted market price are not available the company determines fair value using broker quote or an internal analysis of each investment financial performance and cash flow projection thus financial asset and liability may be classified in level even though there may be some significant input that may be observable the following is description of the valuation methodology used for the company financial asset and liability that are measured at fair value including the general classification of such asset and liability pursuant to the valuation hierarchy cash and cash equivalent the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent approximates fair value maturity are le than three month when quoted price are available in an active market cash equivalent are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy fair value of cash equivalent instrument that do not trade on regular basis in active market are classified level debt security where quoted price are available in an active market debt security are classified in level of the fair value hierarchy the company level debt security consist primarily of treasury security the fair value of the company level debt security are obtained using model such matrix pricing which use quoted market price of debt security with similar characteristic or discounted cash flow to estimate fair value the review these price to ensure they are based on observable market input that include quoted price for similar asset in active market quoted price for identical asset in inactive market and input that are observable that are not price such interest rate and credit risk the company also review the methodology and the assumption used to calculate price from these observable input on quarterly basis the company selects sample of it level debt security price and compare them to price provided by secondary source variance over specified threshold are identified and reviewed to confirm the price provided by the primary source represents an appropriate estimate of fair value in addition the company internal investment team consistently compare the price obtained for select level debt security to the team own independent estimate of fair value for those security the company obtained one price for each of it level debt security and did not adjust any of those price at december or the company also value certain debt security using level input for level debt security fair value are determined by outside broker or in the case of certain private placement security are priced internally outside broker determine the value of these debt security through combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market flow the company did not have any broker quoted debt security for the year ended december and for some private placement security the company internal staff determines the value of these debt security by analyzing spread of corporate and sector index well interest spread of comparable public bond example of these private placement level debt security include certain and foreign security and certain tax exempt municipal security equity security the company currently ha two classification of equity security those that are publicly traded and those that are privately placed publicly traded equity security are classified in level because quoted price are available for these security in an active market for privately placed equity security there is no active market therefore these security are classified in level because the company price these security through an internal analysis of each investment financial statement and cash flow projection significant unobservable input consist of earnings and revenue multiple discount for lack of marketability and comparability adjustment an increase or decrease in any of these unobservable input would have resulted in change in the fair value measurement were no financial liability measured at fair value on recurring basis on the
