information labeling requirement early warning reporting requirement regarding warranty claim field report death and injury report and foreign recall and owner manual requirement the automobile information and disclosure act requires manufacturer of motor vehicle to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer suggested retail price optional equipment and pricing in addition this law allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy rating determined by epa well crash test rating determined by nhtsa if such test are conducted our vehicle sold outside of the are subject to similar foreign safety environmental and other regulation many of those regulation are different from those applicable in the and may require redesign and or retesting the european union ha established new rule regarding additional compliance oversight that are scheduled to commence in and there is also regulatory uncertainty related to the united kingdom impending withdrawal from the european union these change could impact the rollout of new vehicle feature in europe regulation self driving there are no federal regulation pertaining to the safety of self driving vehicle however nhtsa ha established recommended guideline certain state have legal restriction on self driving vehicle and many other state are considering this patchwork increase the legal complexity for our vehicle in europe certain vehicle safety regulation apply to self driving braking and steering system and certain treaty also restrict the legality of certain higher level of self driving vehicle self driving law and regulation are expected to continue to evolve in numerous jurisdiction in the and foreign country and may create restriction on self driving feature that we develop regulation battery safety and testing our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulation that govern transport of dangerous good defined to include lithium ion battery which may present risk in transportation the regulation vary by mode of shipping transportation such by ocean vessel rail truck or air we have completed the applicable transportation test for our battery pack demonstrating our compliance with applicable regulation we use lithium ion cell in our high voltage battery pack the use storage and disposal of our battery pack is regulated under federal law we have agreement with third party battery recycling company to recycle our battery pack automobile manufacturer and dealer regulation state law regulate the manufacture distribution and sale of automobile and generally require motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer to be licensed in order to sell vehicle directly to consumer in the state we open additional tesla store and service center we secure dealer license or their equivalent and engage in sale activity to sell our vehicle directly to consumer few state such michigan and connecticut do not permit automobile manufacturer to be licensed dealer or to act in the capacity of dealer or otherwise restrict manufacturer ability to deliver or service vehicle to sell vehicle to resident of state where we are not licensed dealer we generally conduct the sale out of the state via the internet phone or mail in such state we have opened gallery that serve an educational purpose and are not sale location we expand our retail footprint in the some automobile dealer trade association have both challenged the legality of our operation in court and used administrative and legislative process to attempt to prohibit or limit our ability to operate existing store or expand to new location we expect that the dealer association will continue to mount challenge to our business model in addition we expect the dealer association to actively lobby state licensing agency and legislator to interpret existing law or enact new law in way not favorable to tesla ownership and operation of it own retail and service location and we intend to actively fight any such effort to limit our ability to sell our own vehicle energy storage the regulatory regime for energy storage project is still under development nevertheless there are various policy incentive and financial mechanism at the federal state and local level that support the adoption of energy storage for example energy storage system that are charged using solar energy are eligible for the tax credit under section of the internal revenue code or the irc described below in addition california and number of other state have adopted procurement target for energy storage and behind the meter energy storage system qualify for funding under the california self generation incentive program the federal energy regulatory commission ferc ha also taken step to enable the participation of energy storage in wholesale energy market in and ferc removed many barrier for system like energy storage to provide frequency regulation service thus increasing the value these system can obtain in wholesale energy market more recently in late ferc released notice of proposed rulemaking that if it becomes final rule would further break barrier preventing energy storage from fully participating in wholesale energy market finally in january ferc issued statement supporting the use of energy storage both electric transmission and electric generation concurrently thus enabling energy storage system to provide greater value to the electric grid solar energy system government and utility program and incentive federal state and local government have established various policy incentive and financial mechanism to reduce the cost of solar energy and to accelerate the adoption of solar energy these incentive include tax credit cash grant tax abatement and rebate the federal government currently provides an uncapped investment tax credit itc under two section of the irc section and section section of the irc allows taxpayer to claim credit of of qualified expenditure for commercial solar energy system that commences construction by december the credit then decline to in in and permanent thereafter we claim the section commercial credit when available for both our residential and commercial project based on ownership of the solar energy system the federal government also provides accelerated depreciation for eligible commercial solar energy system section of the irc allows homeowner taxpayer to claim credit of of qualified expenditure for residential solar energy system owned by the homeowner that is placed in service by december the credit then decline to in and in and is scheduled to expire thereafter customer who purchase their solar energy system for cash or through our solar loan offering are eligible to claim the section investment tax credit in addition to the federal itc many state offer personal and corporate tax credit and incentive for solar energy system regulation general we are not regulated utility in the to operate our system we obtain interconnection agreement from the utility in most case interconnection agreement are standard form agreement that have been pre approved by the public utility commission or other regulatory body sale of electricity and non sale equipment lease by third party such our lease and ppas face regulatory challenge in some state and jurisdiction regulation net metering most state in the have regulatory policy known net energy metering or net metering available to solar customer net metering typically allows solar customer to interconnect their on site solar energy system to the utility grid and offset their utility electricity purchase by receiving bill credit for excess energy generated by their solar energy system that is exported to the grid in certain jurisdiction regulator or utility have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net metering or have proposed to do so regulation mandated renewable capacity many state also have adopted procurement requirement for renewable energy production such an enforceable renewable portfolio standard or rps or other policy that require covered entity to procure specified percentage of total electricity delivered to customer in the state from eligible renewable energy source such solar energy system in srec state market the rps requires electricity supplier to secure portion of their electricity from solar generator the srec program provides mean for srecs to be created srec represents the renewable energy associated with kwhs of electricity produced from solar energy system when solar energy system generates kwhs of electricity one srec is issued by government agency which can then be sold separately from the energy produced to covered entity who surrender the srecs to the state to prove compliance with the state renewable energy mandate competition vehicle the worldwide automotive market is highly competitive and we expect it will become even more competitive in the future we introduce additional vehicle in broader cross section of the passenger and commercial vehicle market we believe that our vehicle compete in the market both based on their traditional segment classification well based on their propulsion technology for example model and model compete primarily with premium sedan and premium suv and model competes with small to medium sized sedan which are extremely competitive market with internal combustion vehicle from more established automobile manufacturer moreover many established and new automobile manufacturer have entered or have announced plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market overall we believe these announcement and vehicle introduction promote the development of the alternative fuel vehicle market by highlighting the attractiveness of alternative fuel vehicle particularly those fueled by electricity relative to the internal combustion vehicle many major automobile manufacturer have electric vehicle available today and other current and prospective automobile manufacturer are also developing electric vehicle electric vehicle have also already been brought to market in china and other foreign country and we expect number of those manufacturer to enter the market well in addition several manufacturer offer hybrid vehicle including plug in version energy storage the market for energy storage product is also highly competitive established company such aes energy storage siemens lg chem and samsung well various emerging company have introduced product that are similar to our product portfolio there are several company providing individual component of energy storage system such cell battery module and power electronics well others providing integrated system we compete with these company based on price energy density and efficiency we believe that the specification of our product our strong brand and the modular scalable nature of our powerpack product give competitive advantage when marketing our product solar energy system the primary competitor to our solar energy business are the traditional local utility company that supply energy to our potential customer we compete with these traditional utility company primarily based on price predictability of price and the ease by which customer can switch to electricity generated by our solar energy system we also compete with solar energy company that provide product and service similar to many solar energy company only install solar energy system while others only provide financing for these installation in the residential solar energy system installation market our primary competitor include vivint solar inc sunrun inc trinity solar sunpower corporation and many smaller local solar company intellectual property part of our business we seek to protect our intellectual property right such with respect to patent trademark copyright trade secret including through employee and third party nondisclosure agreement and other contractual arrangement additionally we previously announced patent policy in which we irrevocably pledged that we will not initiate lawsuit against any party for infringing our patent through activity relating to electric vehicle or related equipment for so long such party is acting in good faith we made this pledge in order to encourage the advancement of common rapidly evolving platform for electric vehicle thereby benefiting ourselves other company making electric vehicle and the world segment information we operate two reportable segment automotive and energy generation and storage the automotive segment includes the design development manufacturing sale and leasing of electric vehicle well sale of automotive regulatory credit additionally the automotive segment is also comprised of service and other which includes non warranty after sale vehicle service sale of used vehicle sale of electric vehicle component and system to other manufacturer retail merchandise and sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer the energy generation and storage segment includes the design manufacture installation and sale or leasing of stationary energy storage product and solar energy system and sale of electricity generated by our solar energy system to customer employee of december tesla inc had full time employee to date we have not experienced any work stoppage and we consider our relationship

incorporated by reference into this annual report on form item risk factor you should carefully consider the risk described below together with the other information set forth in this report which could materially affect our business financial condition and future result the risk described below are not the only risk facing our company risk and uncertainty not currently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result risk related to our business and industry we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delay or other complication in the design manufacture launch production delivery and servicing ramp of new vehicle and other product such model model our energy storage product and solar roof which could harm our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we have previously experienced launch manufacturing production and delivery ramp delay or other complication in connection with new vehicle model such model model and model new vehicle feature such the all wheel drive dual motor drivetrain on model and the second version of autopilot hardware and significant increase in automation introduced in the manufacture of model for example we encountered unanticipated challenge such certain supply chain constraint that led to initial delay in producing model similarly we experienced certain challenge in the production of model that led to delay in it ramp moreover in the area of model production where we had challenge ramping fully automated process such portion of the battery module assembly line material flow system and the general assembly line we reduced the level of automation and introduced semi automated or manual process if issue like these arise or recur if our remediation measure and process change do not continue to be successful if we experience issue with transitioning to full automation in certain production line or to other planned manufacturing improvement or if we experience issue or delay in building our gigafactory shanghai in china or commencing and ramping model production there we could experience issue in sustaining the model ramp or delay in increasing model production further also if we encounter difficulty in scaling our delivery or servicing capability for model or future vehicle and product to high volume in the or internationally our financial condition and operating result could suffer in addition our vehicle model share certain production facility with other vehicle model the volume or efficiency of production with respect to one model may impact the production of other model or lead to bottleneck that impact the production of all model we may also experience similar future delay or other complication in bringing to market and ramping production of new vehicle such model the tesla semi our planned pickup truck and new tesla roadster our energy storage product and solar roof any significant additional delay or other complication in the production of and delivery capability for our current product or the development manufacture launch production and delivery and servicing capability ramp of our future product including complication associated with expanding our production capacity supply chain and delivery system or obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval could materially damage our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future delay in realizing our projected timeline and cost and volume target for the production and ramp of model which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plan to manufacture market and sell the model vehicle which we are offering at lower price point and which we are producing at significantly higher volume than the model or model vehicle we commenced production and initial customer delivery of model in july and since then have achieved stabilized production rate at the tesla factory we expect to continue to increase our model production rate to approximately unit per week on sustained basis by the end of moreover in china we expect to commence production of certain trim of model for the local market in china in the initial phase of our gigafactory shanghai by the end of and then progressively increase level of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing inclusive of gigafactory shanghai our goal is to be able to produce model vehicle per week on sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of model vehicle sometime between the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of however the timeframe for commencing model production at gigafactory shanghai is subject to number of uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we have limited experience to date in manufacturing vehicle at the high volume that we recently achieved and to which we anticipate ramping further for model and to be successful we will need to complete the implementation and ramp of efficient and cost effective manufacturing capability process and supply chain necessary to support such volume including at gigafactory shanghai we are employing higher degree of automation in the manufacturing process for model than we have previously employed and to continue to implement additional automation in some case we have temporarily reduced the level of automation and introduced semi automated or manual process at additional labor cost additional bottleneck may also arise we continue to ramp production at the tesla factory and commence the initial phase of model production at gigafactory shanghai and it will be important that we address them promptly and in cost effective manner moreover our model production plan ha generally required to date significant investment of cash and management resource and we expect to deploy some level of additional resource we further progress our ramp and begin production in new location in the future such china our production plan for model is based on many key assumption including that we will be able to sustain and further expand our high volume production of model at the tesla factory without exceeding our projected cost and on our projected timeline that we will be able to continue to expand gigafactory in timely manner to produce high volume of quality lithium ion cell to be integrated into battery module and finished battery pack and drive unit component for model including in part to support production in china the level of local sourcing and manufacturing there progressively increase all at cost that allow to sell model at our target gross margin that we will be able to build and commence production at additional future facility such at gigafactory shanghai to support our international ramp for model in accordance with our projected cost and timeline that the equipment and process which we have selected for model production will be able to accurately manufacture high volume of model vehicle within specified design tolerance and with high quality that we will be able to maintain supplier for the necessary component on term and condition that are acceptable to and that we will be able to obtain high quality component on timely basis and in the necessary quantity to support high volume production and that we will be able to attract recruit hire train and retain skilled employee to operate our planned high volume production facility to support model including at the tesla factory gigafactory and gigafactory shanghai if one or more of the foregoing assumption turn out to be incorrect our ability to meet our model projection on time and at volume and price that are profitable the demand for and delivery of model well our business prospect operating result and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted we may be unable to meet our growing vehicle production sale and delivery plan and servicing need any of which could harm our business and prospect our plan call for sustaining and further ramping from our significant increase in vehicle production and delivery particularly for model our ability to achieve these plan will depend upon number of factor including our ability to utilize installed manufacturing capacity to achieve the planned production yield further install and increase capacity in accordance with our planned timeline and cost maintain our desired quality level and optimize design and production change well our supplier ability to support our need in addition we have used and may use in the future number of new manufacturing technology technique and process for our vehicle which we must successfully introduce and scale for high volume production for example we have introduced highly automated production line aluminum spot welding system and high speed blow forming of certain difficult to stamp vehicle part we have also introduced unique design feature in our vehicle with different manufacturing challenge such large display screen dual motor drivetrain autopilot hardware and falcon wing door we have limited experience developing manufacturing selling and servicing and allocating our available resource among multiple product simultaneously if we are unable to realize our plan our brand business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially damaged concurrent with our increasing vehicle production level we will also need to continue to significantly increase sale and delivery of our vehicle although we have plan for selling and delivering increased volume of vehicle we have limited experience in marketing selling and delivering vehicle at the higher volume at which we are manufacturing model and we may face difficulty meeting our sale and delivery goal in both existing market well new market into which we expand such europe and china where we are beginning to deliver model for the first time in the first quarter of in particular we are targeting for the first time with model mass demographic with broad range of potential customer in which we have limited experience projecting demand and pricing our product while we are producing numerous variant including regional version of model in accordance with the demand that we expect for them if our projection are inaccurate we may not be able to generate sale matched to the specific vehicle that we have the capacity to produce based on vehicle production line constraint and long lead time for procuring certain part moreover because we do not have independent dealer network we are responsible for delivering all of our vehicle to our customer and meeting their vehicle servicing need to date we have limited experience with such delivery and servicing at the scale to which we expect to grow particularly in international market to accommodate our volume we have deployed number of delivery model such delivery to customer home and workplace some of which have not been previously tested at scale and in different geography moreover significant transit time may be required to transport vehicle such model in volume into new market for the first time to the extent that such factor lead to delay in our delivery our result may be negatively impacted finally because of our unique expertise with our vehicle we recommend that our vehicle be serviced by our service center mobile service technician or certain authorized professional that we have specifically trained and equipped if we experience delay in adding such servicing capacity or experience unforeseen issue with the reliability of model which we recently commenced producing at volume it could overburden our servicing capability if we are unable to ramp up to meet our sale delivery and servicing target globally or our projection on which such target are based are inaccurate this could result in negative publicity and damage to our brand and have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result our future growth and success is dependent upon consumer willingness to adopt electric vehicle and specifically our vehicle especially in the mass market demographic which we are targeting with model our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumer of alternative fuel vehicle in general and electric vehicle in particular although we have successfully grown demand for our vehicle thus far there is no guarantee of such future demand or that our vehicle will not compete with one another in the market moreover the model mass market demographic is larger but more competitive than the demographic for model and model and additional electric vehicle are entering the market if the market for electric vehicle in general and tesla vehicle in particular not develop we expect or develops more slowly than we expect or if demand for our vehicle decrease in our market our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be harmed we have only recently begun high volume production of vehicle are still at an earlier stage and have limited resource relative to our competitor and the market for alternative fuel vehicle is rapidly evolving result the market for our vehicle could be affected by numerous factor such perception about electric vehicle feature quality safety performance and cost perception about the limited range over which electric vehicle may be driven on single battery charge competition including from other type of alternative fuel vehicle plug in hybrid electric vehicle and high fuel economy internal combustion engine vehicle volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline government regulation and economic incentive access to charging facility and concern about our future viability we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product according to our schedule and at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result our product contain numerous purchased part which we source globally from hundred of direct supplier the majority of are currently single source supplier although we attempt to qualify and obtain component from multiple source whenever feasible any significant increase in our production may require to procure additional component in short amount of time and in the past we have also replaced certain supplier because of their failure to provide component that met our quality control standard while we believe that we will be able to secure additional or alternate source of supply for most of our component in relatively short time frame there is no assurance that we will be able to do so or develop our own replacement for certain highly customized component of our product moreover we have signed long term agreement with panasonic to be our manufacturing partner and supplier for lithium ion cell at gigafactory in nevada and pv cell and panel at gigafactory in buffalo new york if we encounter unexpected difficulty with key supplier such panasonic and if we are unable to fill these need from other supplier we could experience production delay and potential loss of access to important technology and part for producing servicing and supporting our product this limited and in many case single source supply chain expose to multiple potential source of delivery failure or component shortage for the production of our product such those which we experienced in and in connection with our slower than planned model and model ramp furthermore unexpected change in business condition material pricing labor issue war governmental change natural disaster such the march earthquake in japan and other factor beyond our and our supplier control could also affect our supplier ability to deliver component to on timely basis the loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of component from these supplier could lead to product design change and delay in product delivery to our customer which could hurt our relationship with our customer and result in negative publicity damage to our brand and material and adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result change in our supply chain have also resulted in the past and may result in the future in increased cost we have also experienced cost increase from certain of our supplier in order to meet our quality target and development timeline well due to our design change and we may experience similar cost increase in the future certain supplier have sought to renegotiate the term of supply arrangement additionally we are negotiating with existing supplier for cost reduction seeking new and le expensive supplier for certain part and attempting to redesign certain part to make them le expensive to produce if we are unsuccessful in our effort to control and reduce supplier cost our operating result will suffer in particular because we are producing model at significantly higher volume than any of our other product to date the negative impact of any delay or other constraint with respect to our supplier for model could be substantially greater than any supply chain related issue experienced with respect to our other product we need our model supplier to sustainably ramp in accordance with our ongoing ramp of model and deliver according to our schedule there is no assurance that these supplier will ultimately be able to sustainably and timely meet our cost quality and volume need for example we may experience issue or delay increasing the level of localization in china through local sourcing and manufacturing at our gigafactory shanghai furthermore the scale of our vehicle production increase we will need to accurately forecast purchase warehouse and transport to our manufacturing facility component at much higher volume if we are unable to accurately match the timing and quantity of component purchase to our actual need or successfully implement automation inventory management and other system to accommodate the increased complexity in our supply chain we may incur unexpected production disruption storage transportation and write cost which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result future problem or delay in expanding gigafactory or ramping operation there could negatively affect the production and profitability of our product such model and our energy storage product to lower the cost of cell production and produce cell in high volume we have vertically integrated the production of lithium ion cell and finished battery pack for model and energy storage product at gigafactory while gigafactory began producing lithium ion cell for energy storage product in january and ha since begun producing lithium ion cell for model we have no other direct experience in the production of lithium ion cell given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future event could result in issue or delay in further ramping and expanding production at gigafactory moreover we expect that we will need additional production at gigafactory to support vehicle production at gigafactory shanghai in part when we commence model production there in order to achieve our volume and gross margin target for model and the anticipated ramp in production of energy storage product we must continue to sustain and ramp significant cell production at gigafactory which among other thing requires panasonic to successfully operate and further ramp it cell production line at significant volume although panasonic ha long track record of producing high quality cell at significant volume at it factory in japan it ha limited experience with cell production at gigafactory in addition we produce several component for model such battery module incorporating the lithium ion cell produced by panasonic and drive unit at gigafactory some of the manufacturing line for such component took longer than anticipated to ramp to their full capacity while we have largely overcome this bottleneck after deploying multiple semi automated line and improving our original line additional bottleneck may arise we continue to increase the production rate finally we have announced that we will likely manufacture model at gigafactory if we are unable to maintain gigafactory production ramp additionally over time needed and do so cost effectively or if we or panasonic are unable to attract hire and retain substantial number of highly skilled personnel our ability to supply battery pack or other component for model and our other product could be negatively impacted which could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result if our vehicle or other product that we sell or install fail to perform expected our ability to develop market and sell our product and service could be harmed if our vehicle or our energy product contain defect in design and manufacture that cause them not to perform expected or that require repair or certain feature of our vehicle such full self driving take longer than expected to become enabled or are legally restricted our ability to develop market and sell our product and service could be harmed for example the operation of our vehicle is highly dependent on software which is inherently complex and may contain latent defect and error or be subject to external attack issue experienced by vehicle customer have included those related to the software for the inch display screen the panoramic roof and the volt battery in the model and the seat and door in the model although we attempt to remedy any issue we observe in our product effectively and rapidly possible such effort may not be timely may hamper production or may not be to the satisfaction of our customer while we have performed extensive internal testing on the product we manufacture we currently have limited frame of reference by which to evaluate detailed long term quality reliability durability and performance characteristic of our battery pack powertrains vehicle and energy storage product there can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defect in our product prior to their sale to or installation for consumer any product defect delay or legal restriction on product feature or other failure of our product to perform expected could harm our reputation and result in delivery delay product recall product liability claim and significant warranty and other expense and could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition operating result and prospect if we fail to scale our business operation and otherwise manage future growth and adapt to new condition effectively we rapidly grow our company including internationally we may not be able to produce market sell and service our product successfully any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition we expect to continue to expand our operation significantly including internationally and with our increasing production of model and the worldwide sale delivery and servicing of significantly higher number of vehicle than our current vehicle fleet in the coming year furthermore we are developing and growing our energy storage product and solar business worldwide including in country where we have limited or no previous operating experience our future operating result depend to large extent on our ability to manage our expansion and growth successfully we may not be successful in undertaking this global expansion if we are unable to control expense and avoid cost overrun and other unexpected operating cost establish sufficient worldwide automobile sale delivery service and supercharger facility in timely manner adapt our product and conduct our operation to meet local requirement implement required local infrastructure system and process and find and hire significant number of additional manufacturing engineering service electrical installation construction and administrative personnel in particular we plan to expand our manufacturing capability outside of the where we have limited experience operating factory or managing related regulatory financing and other challenge for example part of our continuing work to increase model production to vehicle per week on sustained basis and make model affordable in the market where we plan to offer it we expect to commence the initial phase of model production at gigafactory shanghai for the local market in china by the end of although the timeframe for that is subject to number of uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to commence our manufacturing activity in china using progressively increased level of localization through local sourcing and manufacturing we expect that we will need to initially support manufacturing activity there with production process at our existing manufacturing facility such gigafactory moreover local manufacturing is critical to our expansion and sale in china which is the largest market for electric vehicle in the world our sale of model and model in china have been negatively impacted by certain tariff on automobile manufactured in the such our vehicle and our cost for producing our vehicle in the have also been affected by import duty on certain component sourced from china if we are not able to establish manufacturing activity in china and other jurisdiction to minimize the impact of such unfavorable tariff duty or cost or ramp our production capability at gigafactory or other facility to support such vehicle manufacturing activity our ability to compete in such jurisdiction and our operating result business and prospect will be harmed if we are unable to achieve our targeted manufacturing cost for our vehicle including model our financial condition and operating result will suffer while we are continuing to and expect in the future to realize cost reduction by both and our supplier there is no guarantee we will be able to achieve sufficient cost saving to reach our gross margin and profitability goal including for the least expensive variant of model that we ultimately expect to produce or our other financial target we incur significant cost related to procuring the material required to manufacture our vehicle assembling vehicle and compensating our personnel if our effort to continue to decrease manufacturing cost are not successful we may incur substantial cost or cost overrun in utilizing and increasing the production capability of our vehicle manufacturing facility such for model both in the and internationally many of the factor that impact our manufacturing cost are beyond our control such potential increase in the cost of our material and component such lithium nickel and other component of our battery cell or aluminum used to produce body panel if we are unable to continue to control and reduce our manufacturing cost our operating result business and prospect will be harmed increase in cost disruption of supply or shortage of material in particular for lithium ion cell could harm our business we may experience increase in the cost or sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of material any such increase supply interruption or shortage could materially and negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we use various material in our business including aluminum steel lithium nickel copper and cobalt well lithium ion cell from supplier the price for these material fluctuate and their available supply may be unstable depending on market condition and global demand for these material including result of increased production of electric vehicle and energy storage product by our competitor and could adversely affect our business and operating result for instance we are exposed to multiple risk relating to lithium ion cell these risk include an increase in the cost or decrease in the available supply of material used in the cell disruption in the supply of cell due to quality issue or recall by battery cell manufacturer or any issue that may arise with respect to cell manufactured at our own facility and fluctuation in the value of the japanese yen against the dollar our battery cell purchase for model and model and some raw material for cell used in model and energy storage product are currently denominated in japanese yen our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cell for the battery pack used in our vehicle and energy storage product while we believe several source of the battery cell are available for such battery pack and expect to eventually rely substantially on battery cell manufactured at our own facility we have to date fully qualified only very limited number of supplier for the cell used in such battery pack and have very limited flexibility in changing cell supplier any disruption in the supply of battery cell from such supplier could disrupt production of our vehicle and of the battery pack we produce for energy product until such time different supplier is fully qualified furthermore fluctuation or shortage in petroleum and other economic condition may cause to experience significant increase in freight charge and material cost substantial increase in the price for our material or price charged to such those charged by battery cell supplier would increase our operating cost and could reduce our margin if we can not recoup the increased cost through increased vehicle price any attempt to increase vehicle price in response to increased material cost could result in cancellation of vehicle order and reservation and therefore materially and adversely affect our brand image business prospect and operating result we may become subject to product liability claim which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claim although we design our vehicle to be the safest vehicle on the road product liability claim even those without merit could harm our business prospect operating result and financial condition the automobile industry in particular experience significant product liability claim and we face inherent risk of exposure to claim in the event our vehicle do not perform or are claimed to not have performed expected is true for other automaker our car have been involved and we expect in the future will be involved in crash resulting in death or personal injury and such crash where autopilot is engaged are the subject of significant public attention we have experienced and we expect to continue to face claim arising from or related to misuse or claimed failure of new technology that we are pioneering including autopilot in our vehicle moreover our solar energy system and energy storage product generate and store electricity they have the potential to cause injury to people or property successful product liability claim against could require to pay substantial monetary award our risk in this area are particularly pronounced given the relatively limited number of vehicle and energy storage product delivered to date and limited field experience of our product moreover product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our product and business and could have material adverse effect on our brand business prospect and operating result in most jurisdiction we generally self insure against the risk of product liability claim for vehicle exposure meaning that any product liability claim will likely have to be paid from company fund not by insurance the market in which we operate are highly competitive and we may not be successful in competing in these industry we currently face competition from new and established domestic and international competitor and expect to face competition from others in the future including competition from company with new technology the worldwide automotive market particularly for alternative fuel vehicle is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future there is no assurance that our vehicle will be successful in the respective market in which they compete significant and growing number of established and new automobile manufacturer well other company have entered or are reported to have plan to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market including hybrid plug in hybrid and fully electric vehicle well the market for self driving technology and application in some case such competitor have announced an intention to produce electric vehicle exclusively at some point in the future most of our current and potential competitor have significantly greater financial technical manufacturing marketing vehicle sale resource and network than we do and may be able to devote greater resource to the design development manufacturing distribution promotion sale and support of their product in particular some competitor have also announced plan to compete with in important and large market for electric vehicle such china increased competition could result in lower vehicle unit sale price reduction revenue shortfall loss of customer and loss of market share which could harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result in addition our model vehicle face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturer in the extremely competitive entry level premium sedan market including audi bmw lexus and mercedes the solar and energy storage industry are highly competitive we face competition from other manufacturer developer and installers of solar and energy storage system well from large utility decrease in the retail price of electricity from utility or other renewable energy source could make our product le attractive to customer and lead to an increased rate of customer default under our existing long term lease and ppas moreover solar panel and lithium ion battery price have declined and are continuing to decline we increase our battery and solar manufacturing capability including at gigafactory and gigafactory future price decline may harm our ability to produce energy storage system and solar system at competitive price if we are unable to establish and maintain confidence in our long term business prospect among consumer analyst and within our industry then our financial condition operating result business prospect and stock price may suffer materially consumer may be le likely to purchase our product if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our service and support and other operation will continue in the long term similarly supplier and other third party will be le likely to invest time and resource in developing business relationship with if they are not convinced that our business will succeed accordingly in order to build and maintain our business we must maintain confidence among customer supplier analyst rating agency and other party in our long term financial viability and business prospect maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by certain factor such our limited operating history negative press customer unfamiliarity with our product any delay in scaling manufacturing delivery and service operation to meet demand competition and uncertainty regarding the future of electric vehicle or our other product and service our quarterly production and sale performance compared with market expectation and any other negative publicity related to many of these factor are largely outside our control and any negative perception about our long term business prospect even if exaggerated or unfounded such speculation regarding the sufficiency or stability of our management team could harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional fund if needed our plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by expanding and optimizing our retail service and vehicle charging operation will require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet expectation with respect to additional sale installation or servicing of our product or availability of public charging solution we plan to generate ongoing growth and demand including by globally expanding and optimizing our retail service and vehicle charging operation these plan require significant cash investment and management resource and may not meet our expectation with respect to additional sale or installation of our product this ongoing global expansion which includes planned entry into market in which we have limited or no experience selling delivering installing and or servicing our product at scale and which may pose legal regulatory labor cultural and political challenge that we have not previously encountered may not have the desired effect of increasing sale and installation and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating furthermore the increasing number of tesla vehicle will require to continue to increase the number of our supercharger station and connector significantly in location throughout the world if we fail to do so in timely manner our customer could become dissatisfied which could adversely affect sale of our vehicle we will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirement applicable to the sale installation and service of our product the sale of electricity generated through our solar energy system and operation of supercharger in those jurisdiction which could take considerable time and expense if we experience any delay or can not meet customer expectation in expanding our customer infrastructure network or our expansion plan are not successful in continuing to grow demand this could lead to decrease or stagnation in sale or installation of our product and could negatively impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result we face risk associated with our global operation and expansion including unfavorable regulatory political economic tax and labor condition and with establishing ourselves in new market all of which could harm our business we currently have global footprint with domestic and international operation and subsidiary in various country and jurisdiction and we continue to expand and optimize our retail service and supercharger capability internationally accordingly we are subject to variety of legal political and regulatory requirement and social and economic condition over which we have little control for example we may be impacted by trade policy political uncertainty and economic cycle involving geographic region where we have significant operation sale of vehicle in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to increased volatility we expand and adjust our operation and retail strategy we are subject to number of risk associated in particular with international business activity that may increase our cost impact our ability to sell our product and require significant management attention these risk include conforming our product to various international regulatory and safety requirement well charging and other electric infrastructure organizing local operating entity difficulty in establishing staffing and managing foreign operation challenge in attracting customer foreign government tax regulation and permit requirement our ability to enforce our contractual right trade restriction custom regulation tariff and price or exchange control and preference of foreign nation for domestically manufactured product for example in china which is key market for certain product such automobile manufactured in the have become subject to recently increased tariff imposed by the government while such increase ha been temporarily suspended the tariff could remain in place for an undetermined length of time be further increased in the future and or lead consumer to postpone or choose another vehicle brand subject to lower tariff or no tariff moreover recently increased import duty on certain component used in our product that are sourced from china may increase our cost and negatively impact our operating result our vehicle and energy storage product make use of lithium ion battery cell which have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame and such event have raised concern and future event may lead to additional concern about the battery used in automotive application the battery pack that we produce make use of lithium ion cell on rare occasion lithium ion cell can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flame in manner that can ignite nearby material well other lithium ion cell while we have designed the battery pack to passively contain any single cell release of energy without spreading to neighboring cell there can be no assurance that field or testing failure of our vehicle or other battery pack that we produce will not occur which could subject to lawsuit product recall or redesign effort all of which would be time consuming and expensive also negative public perception regarding the suitability of lithium ion cell for automotive application or any future incident involving lithium ion cell such vehicle or other fire even if such incident doe not involve our vehicle or energy storage product could seriously harm our business in addition we store significant number of lithium ion cell at our facility and are producing high volume of cell and battery module and pack at gigafactory any mishandling of battery cell may cause disruption to the operation of our facility while we have implemented safety procedure related to the handling of the cell there can be no assurance that safety issue or fire related to the cell would not disrupt our operation such damage or injury could lead to adverse publicity and potentially safety recall moreover any failure of competitor electric vehicle or energy storage product may cause indirect adverse publicity for and our product such adverse publicity could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result if we fail to effectively grow and manage the residual financing and credit risk related to our vehicle financing program our business may suffer we offer financing arrangement for our vehicle in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution we also currently offer model and model leasing directly through our local subsidiary in the and canada under lease held directly by we typically receive only very small portion of the total vehicle purchase price at the time of lease followed by stream of payment over the term of the lease the profitability of any vehicle returned to at the end of their lease depends on our ability to accurately project our vehicle residual value at the outset of the lease and such value may fluctuate prior to the end of their term depending on various factor such supply and demand of our used vehicle economic cycle and the pricing of new vehicle the leasing program also relies on our ability to secure adequate financing and or business partner to fund and grow this program and screen for and manage customer credit risk we expect the availability of leasing and other financing option will be important for our vehicle customer if we are unable to adequately fund our leasing program with internal fund or partner or other external financing source and compelling alternative financing program are not available for our customer we may be unable to grow our sale furthermore if our leasing business grows substantially our business may suffer if we can not effectively manage the greater level of residual and credit risk resulting from growth finally if we do not successfully monitor and comply with applicable national state and or local financial regulation and consumer protection law governing lease transaction we may become subject to enforcement action or penalty either of which may harm our business moreover we have provided resale value guarantee to customer and partner for certain financing program under which such counterparties may sell their vehicle back to at certain point in time at pre determined amount however actual resale value with residual value for leased vehicle are subject to similar fluctuation over the term of the financing arrangement if the actual resale value of any vehicle resold or returned to pursuant to these program are materially lower than the pre determined amount we have offered our operating result profitability and or liquidity could be negatively impacted the unavailability reduction or elimination of or unfavorable determination with respect to government and economic incentive in the and abroad supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle energy storage product or solar energy could have some impact on demand for our product and service we and our customer currently benefit from certain government and economic incentive supporting the development and adoption of electric vehicle in the and abroad such incentive include among other thing tax credit or rebate that encourage the purchase of electric vehicle in norway for example the purchase of electric vehicle is not currently subject to import tax the value added tax or the carbon dioxide and weight based purchase tax that apply to the purchase of gas powered vehicle notably the quantum of incentive program promoting electric vehicle is tiny fraction of the amount of subsidy that are provided to gas powered vehicle through the oil and gas industry nevertheless even the limited benefit from such program could be reduced eliminated or exhausted for example under current regulation federal tax credit that wa available in the for the purchase of our vehicle is being reduced in phase during and will sunset at the end of we believe the first reduction in this tax credit may have pulled forward some near term demand in the into and could create similar pull forward in before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit moreover in july previously available incentive for purchase of model in ontario canada wa cancelled and tesla buyer in germany lost access to electric vehicle incentive for short period of time beginning late in april and january respectively previously available incentive in hong kong and denmark that favored the purchase of electric vehicle expired negatively impacting sale effective march california implemented regulation phasing out cash rebate on qualified electric vehicle for high income consumer such development could have some negative impact on demand for our vehicle and we and our customer may have to adjust to them in addition certain governmental rebate tax credit and other financial incentive that are currently available with respect to our solar and energy storage product business allow to lower our installation cost and cost of capital and encourage customer to buy our product and investor to invest in our solar financing fund however these incentive may expire on particular date when the allocated funding is exhausted reduced or terminated renewable energy adoption rate increase often without warning for example the federal government currently offer itc for the installation of solar power facility and energy storage system that are charged from co sited solar power facility the itc is currently scheduled to decline in phase ultimately to for commercial and utility system and to for customer owned residential system by january likewise in jurisdiction where net energy metering is currently available our customer receive bill credit from utility for energy that their solar energy system generate and export to the grid in excess of the electric load they use several jurisdiction have reduced or eliminated the benefit available under net energy metering or have proposed to do so such reduction in or termination of governmental incentive could adversely impact our result by making our product le competitive for potential customer increasing our cost of capital and adversely impacting our ability to attract investment partner and to form new financing fund for our solar and energy storage asset additionally the enactment of the tax cut and job act in the could potentially increase the cost and decrease the availability of renewable energy financing by reducing the value of depreciation benefit associated with and the overall investor tax capacity needed to monetize renewable energy project such change could lower the overall investment willingness and capacity for such project available in the market moreover we and our fund investor claim the itc and certain state incentive in amount based on the fair market value of our solar and energy storage system although we obtain independent appraisal to support the claimed fair market value the relevant governmental authority have audited such value and in certain case have determined that they should be lower and they may do so in the future such determination may result in adverse tax consequence and or our obligation to make indemnification or other payment to our fund or fund investor any failure by to realize the expected benefit of our substantial investment and commitment with respect to the manufacture of pv cell and module including if we are unable to comply with the term of our agreement with the research foundation for the state university of new york relating to our gigafactory could result in negative consequence for our business we own certain pv cell and module manufacturing and technology asset and build to suit lease arrangement with the research foundation for the state university of new york the suny foundation this agreement with the suny foundation provides for the construction of gigafactory in buffalo new york with the intended capacity to produce at least gw of solar product annually under this agreement we are obligated to among other thing employ specified minimum number of personnel in the state of new york and spend or incur billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period following the completion of all construction and related infrastructure the arrival of manufacturing equipment and the receipt of certain permit and other specified item at gigafactory if we fail in any year over the course of the term of the agreement to meet these obligation we would be obligated to pay program payment of million to the suny foundation in such year any inability on our part to comply with the requirement of this agreement may result in the payment of significant amount to the suny foundation the termination of our lease at gigafactory and or the need to secure an alternative supply of pv cell and module for our solar product moreover if we are unable to utilize our manufacturing and technology asset in accordance with our expectation we may have to recognize accounting charge pertaining to the write off of such asset any of the foregoing event could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result if we are unable to attract and or retain key employee and hire qualified personnel our ability to compete could be harmed the loss of the service of any of our key employee could disrupt our operation delay the development and introduction of our vehicle and service and negatively impact our business prospect and operating result in particular we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer and jeffrey straubel our chief technology officer none of our key employee is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we may not be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain executive officer and other key technology sale marketing engineering manufacturing and support personnel especially to support our high volume manufacture of vehicle and expansion plan and any failure or delay in so could adversely impact our business prospect financial condition and operating result key talent may leave tesla due to various factor such very competitive labor market for talented individual with automotive or technology experience or any negative publicity related to in california nevada and other region where we have operation there is increasing competition for individual with skillsets needed for our business including specialized knowledge of electric vehicle software engineering manufacturing engineering and other skill such electrical and building construction expertise this competition affect both our ability to retain key employee and hire new one moreover we have in the past conducted reduction in force in order to optimize our organizational structure and reduce cost and certain senior personnel have also departed for various reason our continued success depends upon our continued ability to hire new employee in timely manner especially to support our expansion plan and to retain current employee or replace departed senior employee with qualified and experienced individual which is typically time consuming process additionally we compete with both mature and prosperous company that have far greater financial resource than we do and start ups and emerging company that promise short term growth opportunity difficulty in retaining current employee or recruiting new one could have an adverse effect on our performance and result finally our compensation philosophy for all of our personnel reflects our startup origin with an emphasis on equity based award and benefit in order to closely align their incentive with the long term interest of our stockholder each of our current equity incentive plan and employee stock purchase plan provides for an evergreen provision that permit our board of director to increase on an annual basis subject to specified limit the number of equity based award that may be granted to and share of our common stock that may be purchased by our personnel thereunder these plan are currently scheduled to expire in december and we will need to extend them or establish new plan in order to continue to compensate our employee following their expiration which will require the approval of our stockholder moreover there is no assurance that these plan extended or any future plan will contain evergreen provision which would mean that we would have to periodically seek and obtain approval from our stockholder for future increase to the number of award that may be granted and share that may be purchased under such plan if we are unable to obtain such stockholder approval and compensate our personnel in accordance with our compensation philosophy our ability to retain and hire qualified personnel would be negatively impacted we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer we are highly dependent on the service of elon musk our chief executive officer and largest stockholder although mr musk spends significant time with tesla and is highly active in our management doe not devote full time and attention to tesla mr musk also currently serf chief executive officer and chief technical officer of space exploration technology corp developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicle and is involved in other emerging technology venture we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology system and use security measure designed to protect our system against breach and cyber attack if these effort are not successful our business and operation could be disrupted and our operating result and reputation could be harmed we are continuously expanding and improving our information technology system including implementing new internally developed system to assist in the management of our business in particular our volume production of multiple vehicle necessitates continued development maintenance and improvement of our information technology system in the and abroad which include product data management procurement inventory management production planning and execution sale service and logistics dealer management financial tax and regulatory compliance system we also maintain information technology measure designed to protect against intellectual property theft data breach and other cyber attack the implementation maintenance and improvement of these system require significant management time support and cost moreover there are inherent risk associated with developing improving and expanding our core system well implementing new system including the disruption of our data management procurement manufacturing execution finance supply chain and sale and service process these risk may affect our ability to manage our data and inventory procure part or supply or manufacture sell deliver and service vehicle or achieve and maintain compliance with or realize available benefit under tax law and other applicable regulation we can not be sure that these system or their required functionality will be effectively implemented maintained or expanded planned if we do not successfully implement maintain or expand these system planned our operation may be disrupted our ability to accurately and or timely report our financial result could be impaired and deficiency may arise in our internal control over financial reporting which may impact our ability to certify our financial result moreover our proprietary information could be compromised or misappropriated and our reputation may be adversely affected if these system or their functionality do not operate we expect them to we may be required to expend significant resource to make correction or find alternative source for performing these function any unauthorized control or manipulation of our product system could result in loss of confidence in and our product and harm our business our product contain complex information technology system for example our vehicle and energy storage product are designed with built in data connectivity to accept and install periodic remote update from to improve or update their functionality we have designed implemented and tested security measure intended to prevent unauthorized access to our information technology network our product and their system however hacker have reportedly attempted and may attempt in the future to gain unauthorized access to modify alter and use such network product and system to gain control of or to change our product functionality user interface and performance characteristic or to gain access to data stored in or generated by our product we encourage reporting of potential vulnerability in the security of our product via our security vulnerability reporting policy and we aim to remedy any reported and verified vulnerability accordingly we have received report of potential vulnerability in the past and have attempted to remedy them however there can be no assurance that vulnerability will not be exploited in the future before they can be identified or that our remediation effort are or will be successful any unauthorized access to or control of our product or their system or any loss of data could result in legal claim or proceeding in addition regardless of their veracity report of unauthorized access to our product their system or data well other factor that may result in the perception that our product their system or data are capable of being hacked could negatively affect our brand and harm our business prospect financial condition and operating result we have been the subject of such report in the past we are subject to various environmental and safety law and regulation that could impose substantial cost upon and negatively impact our ability to operate our manufacturing facility manufacturing company including with respect to facility such the tesla factory gigafactory and gigafactory we are subject to complex environmental health and safety law and regulation at numerous jurisdictional level in the and abroad including law relating to the use handling storage disposal and human exposure to hazardous material the cost of compliance including remediating contamination if any is found on our property and any change to our operation mandated by new or amended law may be significant we may also face unexpected delay in obtaining permit and approval required by such law in connection with our manufacturing facility which would hinder our operation of these facility such cost and delay may adversely impact our business prospect and operating result furthermore any violation of these law may result in substantial fine and penalty remediation cost third party damage or suspension or cessation of our operation our business may be adversely affected by any disruption caused by union activity it is common for employee at company with significant manufacturing operation such to belong to union which can result in higher employee cost and increased risk of work stoppage moreover regulation in some jurisdiction outside of the mandate employee participation in industrial collective bargaining agreement and work council with certain consultation right with respect to the relevant company operation although we work diligently to provide the best possible work environment for our employee they may still decide to join or seek recognition to form labor union or we may be required to become union signatory the united automobile worker uaw ha been engaged in campaign to organize manufacturing operation at tesla part of that campaign the uaw ha filed with the national labor relation board nlrb series of unfair labor practice charge against tesla on which hearing recently concluded we can not predict the timing of the nlrb decision and an unfavorable outcome for tesla may have negative impact on the perception of tesla treatment of our employee furthermore we are directly or indirectly dependent upon company with unionized work force such part supplier and trucking and freight company and work stoppage or strike organized by such union could have material adverse impact on our business financial condition or operating result if work stoppage occurs it could delay the manufacture and sale of our product and have material adverse effect on our business prospect operating result or financial condition our product and service are subject to substantial regulation which are evolving and unfavorable change or failure by to comply with these regulation could substantially harm our business and operating result motor vehicle are subject to substantial regulation under international federal state and local law we incur significant cost in complying with these regulation and may be required to incur additional cost to comply with any change to such regulation and any failure to comply could result in significant expense delay or fine we are subject to law and regulation applicable to the supply manufacture import sale and service of automobile internationally for example in country outside of the we are required to meet standard relating to vehicle safety fuel economy and emission among other thing that are often materially different from requirement in the thus resulting in additional investment into the vehicle and system to ensure regulatory compliance in those country this process may include official review and certification of our vehicle by foreign regulatory agency prior to market entry well compliance with foreign reporting and recall management system requirement additionally our vehicle are equipped with suite of driver assistance feature called autopilot which help assist driver with certain tedious and potentially dangerous aspect of road travel but require driver to remain engaged there is variety of international federal and state regulation that may apply to self driving vehicle which include many existing vehicle standard that were not originally intended to apply to vehicle that may not have driver such regulation continue to rapidly change which increase the likelihood of patchwork of complex or conflicting regulation or may delay product or restrict self driving feature and availability any of which could adversely affect our business moreover manufacturer and installer of solar generation and energy storage system and supplier of electricity generated and stored by the solar energy and energy storage system we install for customer we are impacted by federal state and local regulation and policy concerning electricity pricing the interconnection of electricity generation and storage equipment with the electric grid and the sale of electricity generated by third party owned system for example existing or proposed regulation and policy would permit utility to limit the amount of electricity generated by our customer with their solar energy system charge fee and penalty to our customer relating to the purchase of energy other than from the grid adjust electricity rate design such that the price of our solar product may not be competitive with that of electricity from the grid restrict and our customer from transacting under our ppas or qualifying for government incentive and benefit that apply to solar power and limit or eliminate net energy metering if such regulation and policy remain in effect or are adopted in other jurisdiction or if other regulation and policy that adversely impact the interconnection or use of our solar and energy storage system are introduced they could deter potential customer from purchasing our solar and energy storage product threaten the economics of our existing contract and cause to cease solar and energy storage system sale and operation in the relevant jurisdiction which could harm our business prospect financial condition and result of operation failure to comply with various privacy and consumer protection law to which we are subject could harm the company our privacy policy is posted on our website and any failure by or our vendor or other business partner to comply with it or with federal state or international privacy data protection or security law or regulation could result in regulatory or litigation related action against legal liability fine damage and other cost substantial expense and operational change may be required in connection with maintaining compliance with such law and in particular certain emerging privacy law are still subject to high degree of uncertainty to their interpretation and application for example in may the general data protection regulation the gdpr began to fully apply to the processing of personal information collected from individual located in the european union the gdpr ha created new compliance obligation and ha significantly increased fine for noncompliance although we take step to protect the security of our customer personal information we may be required to expend significant resource to comply with data breach requirement if third party improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customer or we otherwise experience data loss with respect to customer personal information major breach of our network security and system could have negative consequence for our business and future prospect including possible fine penalty and damage reduced customer demand for our vehicle and harm to our reputation and brand we may choose to or be compelled to undertake product recall or take other similar action which could adversely affect our brand image and financial performance any product recall with respect to our product may result in adverse publicity damage our brand and adversely affect our business prospect operating result and financial condition for example certain vehicle recall that we initiated have resulted from various cause including component that could prevent the parking brake from releasing engaged concern with the firmware in the restraint control module in certain right hand drive vehicle industry wide issue with airbags from particular supplier model seat component that could cause unintended seat movement during collision and concern of corrosion in model power steering assist motor bolt furthermore testing of our product by government regulator or industry group may require to initiate product recall or may result in negative public perception about the safety of our product in the future we may at various time voluntarily or involuntarily initiate recall if any of our product or our electric vehicle powertrain component that we have provided to other vehicle oems including any system or part sourced from our supplier prove to be defective or noncompliant with applicable law and regulation such federal motor vehicle safety standard such recall whether voluntary or involuntary or caused by system or component engineered or manufactured by or our supplier could involve significant expense and could adversely affect our brand image in our target market well our business prospect financial condition and result of operation our current and future warranty reserve may be insufficient to cover future warranty claim which could adversely affect our financial performance subject to separate limited warranty for the supplemental restraint system battery and drive unit we provide four year or mile limited warranty for the purchaser of new model model and model vehicle and either four year or mile limited warranty or two year or mile maximum odometer limited warranty for the purchaser of used model or model vehicle certified and sold by the limited warranty for the battery and drive unit for new model and model vehicle cover the drive unit for eight year well the battery for period of eight year or for certain older vehicle mile if reached sooner than eight year although the battery charging capacity is not covered under any of our warranty or extended service plan the limited warranty for used model and model vehicle doe not extend or otherwise alter the term of the original battery and drive unit limited warranty for such used vehicle specified in their original new vehicle limited warranty for the battery and drive unit on our current new model vehicle we offer an eight year or mile limited warranty for our standard or mid range battery and an eight year or mile limited warranty for our long range battery with minimum retention of battery capacity over the warranty period in addition customer of new model and model vehicle have the opportunity to purchase an extended service plan for the period after the end of the limited warranty for their new vehicle to cover additional service for up to an additional four year or mile for energy storage product we provide limited warranty against defect and to guarantee minimum energy retention level for example we currently guarantee that each powerwall product will maintain at least or depending on the region of installation of it stated energy capacity after year and that each powerpack product will retain specified minimum energy capacity in each of it first year of use for our solar roof we currently offer warranty on the glass tile for the lifetime of customer home and separate warranty for the energy generation capability of the solar tile we also offer extended warranty availability guarantee and capacity guarantee for period of up to year at an additional cost at the time of purchase well workmanship warranty to customer who elect to have install their system finally customer who lease solar energy system lease or buy energy from under ppas are covered by warranty equal to the length of the agreement term which is typically year system purchased for cash are covered by workmanship warranty of up to year in addition we pas through to our customer the inverter and panel manufacturer warranty which generally range from to year finally we provide performance guarantee with our leased solar energy system that compensates customer on an annual basis if their system doe not meet the electricity production guarantee set forth in their lease under these performance guarantee we bear the risk of production shortfall resulting from an inverter or panel failure these risk are exacerbated in the event the panel or inverter manufacturer cease operation or fail to honor their warranty if our warranty reserve are inadequate to cover future warranty claim on our product our business prospect financial condition and operating result could be materially and adversely affected warranty reserve include our management best estimate of the projected cost to repair or to replace item under warranty these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim such estimate are inherently uncertain and change to our historical or projected experience especially with respect to product such model and solar roof that we have recently introduced and or that we expect to produce at significantly greater volume than our past product may cause material change to our warranty reserve in the future our insurance strategy may not be adequate to protect from all business risk we may be subject in the ordinary course of business to loss resulting from product liability accident act of god and other claim against for which we may have no insurance coverage general matter we do not maintain much insurance coverage many other company do and in some case we do not maintain any at all additionally the policy that we do have may include significant deductible or self insured retention and we can not be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future loss or claim against loss that is uninsured or which exceeds policy limit may require to pay substantial amount which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating result our financial result may vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuation in our operating cost and other factor we expect our period to period financial result to vary based on our operating cost which we anticipate will fluctuate the pace at which we continue to design develop and manufacture new product and increase production capacity by expanding our current manufacturing facility and adding future facility such gigafactory shanghai may not be consistent or linear between period additionally our revenue from period to period may fluctuate we introduce existing product to new market for the first time and we develop and introduce new product result of these factor we believe that quarter to quarter comparison of our financial result especially in the short term are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparison can not be relied upon indicator of future performance moreover our financial result may not meet expectation of equity research analyst rating agency or investor who may be focused only on quarterly financial result if any of this occurs the trading price of our stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time servicing our indebtedness requires significant amount of cash and there is no guarantee that we will have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial indebtedness of december we and our subsidiary had outstanding billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness see note long term debt obligation to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form our substantial consolidated indebtedness may increase our vulnerability to any generally adverse economic and industry condition we and our subsidiary may subject to the limitation in the term of our existing and future indebtedness incur additional debt secure existing or future debt or recapitalize our debt pursuant to their term holder of our convertible senior note due convertible senior note due and convertible senior note due collectively the tesla convertible note may convert their respective tesla convertible note at their option prior to the scheduled maturity of the respective tesla convertible note under certain circumstance upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible note we will be obligated to deliver cash and or share in respect of the principal amount thereof and the conversion value in excess of such principal amount on such tesla convertible note moreover our subsidiary convertible senior note due and zero coupon convertible senior note due together the subsidiary convertible note are convertible into share of our common stock at conversion price ranging from to per share finally holder of the tesla convertible note and the subsidiary convertible note will have the right to require to repurchase their note upon the occurrence of fundamental change at purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the note plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to but not including the fundamental change purchase date our ability to make scheduled payment of the principal and interest on our indebtedness when due or to make payment upon conversion or repurchase demand with respect to our convertible note or to refinance our indebtedness we may need or desire depends on our future performance which is subject to economic financial competitive and other factor beyond our control our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operation in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligation under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditure if we are unable to generate such cash flow we may be required to adopt one or more alternative such reducing or delaying investment or capital expenditure selling asset refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on term that may be onerous or highly dilutive our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital market and our financial condition at such time in addition our ability to make payment may be limited by law by regulatory authority or by agreement governing our future indebtedness we may not be able to engage in any of these activity or engage in these activity on desirable term or at all which could result in default on our existing or future indebtedness and have material adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition our debt agreement contain covenant restriction that may limit our ability to operate our business the term of certain of our credit facility including our senior secured asset based revolving credit agreement contain and any of our other future debt agreement may contain covenant restriction that limit our ability to operate our business including restriction on our ability to among other thing incur additional debt or issue guarantee create lien repurchase stock or make other restricted payment and make certain voluntary prepayment of specified debt in addition under certain circumstance we are required to comply with fixed charge coverage ratio result of these covenant our ability to respond to change in business and economic condition and engage in beneficial transaction including to obtain additional financing needed may be restricted furthermore our failure to comply with our debt covenant could result in default under our debt agreement which could permit the holder to accelerate our obligation to repay the debt if any of our debt is accelerated we may not have sufficient fund available to repay it we may need or want to raise additional fund and these fund may not be available to when we need them if we can not raise additional fund when we need or want them our operation and prospect could be negatively affected the design manufacture sale installation and or servicing of automobile energy storage product and solar product is capital intensive business and the specific timing of cash inflow and outflow may fluctuate substantially from period to period until we are consistently generating positive free cash flow we may need or want to raise additional fund through the issuance of equity equity related or debt security or through obtaining credit from financial institution to fund together with our principal source of liquidity the cost of developing and manufacturing our current or future vehicle energy storage product and or solar product to pay any significant unplanned or accelerated expense or for new significant strategic investment or to refinance our significant consolidated indebtedness even if not required to do so by the term of such indebtedness we need sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operation ramp vehicle production continue research and development project establish sale delivery and service center build and deploy supercharger expand gigafactory ramp production at gigafactory build and commence model production at gigafactory shanghai and to make the investment in tooling and manufacturing capital required to introduce new vehicle energy storage product and solar product we can not be certain that additional fund will be available to on favorable term when required or at all if we can not raise additional fund when we need them our financial condition result of operation business and prospect could be materially and adversely affected additionally we use capital from third party investor to enable our customer access to our solar energy system with little or no upfront cost the availability of this financing depends upon many factor including the confidence of the investor in the solar energy industry the quality and mix of our customer contract any regulatory change impacting the economics of our existing customer contract change in law including tax law risk or government incentive associated with these financing and our ability to compete with other renewable energy company for the limited number of potential investor moreover while interest rate remain at low level they have risen in recent period if the rate of return required by investor rise result of rise in interest rate it will reduce the present value of the customer payment stream underlying and therefore the total value of our financing structure increasing our cost of capital if we are unable to establish new financing fund on favorable term for third party ownership arrangement we may be unable to finance the installation of our solar energy system for our lease or ppa customer system or our cost of capital could increase and our liquidity may be negatively impacted which would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence arising out of certain governmental investigation and proceeding we are cooperating with certain government investigation discussed in note commitment and contingency to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form aside from the settlement with the sec discussed below relating to elon musk statement that he wa considering taking tesla private to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation ha concluded that any wrongdoing occurred however we can not predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matter and there exists the possibility that we could be subject to liability penalty and other restrictive sanction and adverse consequence if the sec the doj or any other government agency were to pursue legal action in the future moreover we expect to incur cost in responding to related request for information and subpoena and if instituted in defending against any governmental proceeding for example on october the district court for the southern district of new york entered final judgment approving the term of settlement filed with the court on september in connection with the action taken by the sec relating to mr musk statement on august that he wa considering taking tesla private pursuant to the settlement we among other thing paid civil penalty of million appointed an independent director the chair of the board appointed two additional independent director to the board and made further enhancement to our disclosure control and other corporate governance related matter although we intend to continue to comply with the term and requirement of the settlement if there is lack of compliance additional enforcement action or other legal proceeding may be instituted against if we update or discontinue the use of our manufacturing equipment more quickly than expected we may have to shorten the useful life of any equipment to be retired result of any such update and the resulting acceleration in our depreciation could negatively affect our financial result we have invested and expect to continue to invest significantly in we believe is state of the art tooling machinery and other manufacturing equipment for our various product line and we depreciate the cost of such equipment over their expected useful life however manufacturing technology may evolve rapidly and we may decide to update our manufacturing process with cutting edge equipment more quickly than expected moreover we are continually implementing learning our engineering and manufacturing expertise and efficiency increase which may result in our ability to manufacture our product using le of our currently installed equipment alternatively we ramp production of model to higher level our learning may cause to discontinue the use of already installed equipment in favor of different or additional equipment the useful life of any equipment that would be retired early result would be shortened causing the depreciation on such equipment to be accelerated and our result of operation could be negatively impacted we are exposed to fluctuation in currency exchange rate which could negatively affect our financial result our revenue and cost denominated in foreign currency are not completely matched we have increased vehicle delivery in market outside of the we have much higher revenue than cost denominated in other currency such the euro canadian dollar chinese yuan and norwegian krone any strengthening of the dollar would tend to reduce our revenue measured in dollar we have historically experienced in addition portion of our cost and expense have been and we anticipate will continue to be denominated in foreign currency including the japanese yen if we do not have fully offsetting revenue in these currency and if the value of the dollar depreciates significantly against these currency our cost measured in dollar percent of our revenue will correspondingly increase and our margin will suffer moreover while we undertake limited hedging activity intended to offset the impact of currency translation exposure it is impossible to predict or eliminate such impact result our operating result could be adversely affected we may face regulatory limitation on our ability to sell vehicle directly which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicle we sell our vehicle directly to consumer using mean that we believe will maximize our reach currently including through our website and our own store while we intend to continue to leverage our most effective sale strategy we may not be able to sell our vehicle through our own store in each state in the some state have law that may be interpreted to impose limitation on this direct to consumer sale model in certain state in which we are not able to obtain dealer license we have opened gallery which are not full sale location the application of these state law to our operation continues to be difficult to predict law in some state have limited our ability to obtain dealer license from state motor vehicle regulator and may continue to do so in addition decision by regulator permitting to sell vehicle may be challenged by dealer association and others to whether such decision comply with applicable state motor vehicle industry law we have prevailed in many of these lawsuit and such result have reinforced our continuing belief that state law were not designed to prevent our distribution model in some state there have also been regulatory and legislative effort by dealer association to propose law that if enacted would prevent from obtaining dealer license in their state given our current sale model few state have passed legislation that clarifies our ability to operate but at the same time limit the number of dealer license we can obtain or store that we can operate we have also filed lawsuit in federal court in michigan challenging the constitutionality of the state prohibition on direct sale applied to our business internationally there may be law in jurisdiction we have not yet entered or law we are unaware of in jurisdiction we have entered that may restrict our sale or other business practice even for those jurisdiction we have analyzed the law in this area can be complex difficult to interpret and may change over time continued regulatory limitation and other obstacle interfering with our ability to sell vehicle directly to consumer could have negative and material impact our business prospect financial condition and result of operation we may need to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement claim which may be time consuming and could cause to incur substantial cost others including our competitor may hold or obtain patent copyright trademark or other proprietary right that could prevent limit or interfere with our ability to make use develop sell or market our product and service which could make it more difficult for to operate our business from time to time the holder of such intellectual property right may assert their right and urge to take license and or may bring suit alleging infringement or misappropriation of such right we may consider the entering into licensing agreement with respect to such right although no assurance can be given that such license can be obtained on acceptable term or that litigation will not occur and such license could significantly increase our operating expense in addition if we are determined to have infringed upon third party intellectual property right we may be required to cease making selling or incorporating certain component or intellectual property into the good and service we offer to pay substantial damage and or license royalty to redesign our product and service and or to establish and maintain alternative branding for our product and service in the event that we were required to take one or more such action our business prospect operating result and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in addition any litigation or claim whether or not valid could result in substantial cost negative publicity and diversion of resource and management attention tesla is highly visible public company whose product business result of operation statement and action are often scrutinized by critic whose influence could negatively impact the perception of our brand and the market value of our common stock tesla is highly visible public company whose product business result of operation statement and action are well publicized such attention includes frequent criticism of by range of third party our continued success depends on our ability to focus on executing on our mission and business plan while maintaining the trust of our current and potential customer employee stockholder and business partner any negative perceived action of ours could influence the perception of our brand or our leadership by our customer supplier or investor which could adversely impact our business prospect operating result and the market value of our common stock our facility or operation could be damaged or adversely affected result of disaster our corporate headquarters the tesla factory and gigafactory are located in seismically active region in northern california and nevada if major disaster such earthquake or other event occur or our information system or communication network break down or operates improperly our headquarters and production facility may be seriously damaged or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our product we may incur expense relating to such damage which could have material adverse impact on our business operating result and financial condition risk related to the ownership of our common stock the trading price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock ha been highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide fluctuation in response to various factor some of which are beyond our control our common stock ha experienced an intra day trading high of per share and low of per share over the last week the stock market in general and the market for technology company in particular ha experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those company in particular large proportion of our common stock ha been and may continue to be traded by short seller which may put pressure on the supply and demand for our common stock further influencing volatility in it market price public perception and other factor outside of our control may additionally impact the stock price of company like that garner disproportionate degree of public attention regardless of actual operating performance in addition in the past following period of volatility in the overall market and the market price of particular company security security class action litigation ha often been instituted against these company moreover stockholder litigation like this ha been filed against in the past while we are continuing to defend such action vigorously any judgment against or any future stockholder litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our management attention and resource we may fail to meet our publicly announced guidance or other expectation about our business which could cause our stock price to decline we provide guidance regarding our expected financial and business performance such projection regarding sale and production well anticipated future revenue gross margin profitability and cash flow correctly identifying key factor affecting business condition and predicting future event is inherently an uncertain process and our guidance may not ultimately be accurate our guidance is based on certain assumption such those relating to anticipated production and sale volume which generally are not linear throughout given period average sale price supplier and commodity cost and planned cost reduction if our guidance is not accurate or varies from actual result due to our inability to meet our assumption or the impact on our financial performance that could occur result of various risk and uncertainty the market value of our common stock could decline significantly transaction relating to our convertible note may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholder or may otherwise depress the price of our common stock the conversion of some or all of the tesla convertible note or the subsidiary convertible note would dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholder to the extent we deliver share upon conversion of any of such note our subsidiary convertible note have been historically and the other tesla convertible note may become in the future convertible at the option of their holder prior to their scheduled term under certain circumstance if holder elect to convert their convertible note we could be required to deliver to them significant number of share of our common stock any sale in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market price of our common stock in addition the existence of the convertible note may encourage short selling by market participant because the conversion of such note could be used to satisfy short position or anticipated conversion of such note into share of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock moreover in connection with each issuance of the tesla convertible note we entered into convertible note hedge transaction which are expected to reduce the potential dilution and or offset potential cash payment we are required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the applicable tesla convertible note we also entered into warrant transaction with the hedge counterparties which could separately have dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant on the applicable expiration date in addition the hedge counterparties or their affiliate may enter into various transaction with respect to their hedge position which could also cause or prevent an increase or decrease in the market price of our common stock or the convertible note elon musk ha pledged share of our common stock to secure certain bank borrowing if mr musk were forced

in conjunction with the consolidated financial statement and the related note included elsewhere in this annual report on form overview and highlight our mission is to accelerate the world transition to sustainable energy we design develop manufacture lease and sell high performance fully electric vehicle solar energy generation system and energy storage product we also offer maintenance installation operation and other service related to our product automotive our production vehicle fleet includes our model premium sedan and our model suv which are our highest performance vehicle and our model lower priced sedan designed for the mass market we continue to enhance our vehicle offering with enhanced autopilot option internet connectivity and free over the air software update to provide additional safety convenience and performance feature in addition we have several future electric vehicle in our product pipeline including model tesla semi pickup truck and new version of the tesla roadster in we continued to scale our automotive operation particularly our ramp of model and achieved total production of vehicle and delivered vehicle representing year over year increase of approximately and respectively energy generation and storage we lease and sell retrofit solar energy system and sell renewable energy and energy storage product to our customer and are ramping our solar roof product that combine solar energy generation with attractive integrated styling our energy storage product which we manufacture at gigafactory consist of powerwall mostly for residential application and powerpack for commercial industrial and utility scale application during we deployed gwh of energy storage product nearly tripling our mwh of energy storage deployment during we also deployed megawatt mw of solar energy generation during management opportunity challenge and risk and outlook automotive demand production and delivery our goal is to produce the world highest quality vehicle quickly and cost effectively possible with priority on workplace health and safety the worldwide automotive market for alternative fuel vehicle and self driving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so growing number of company including established automaker have announced plan to expand and in some case fully transition to production of electric or environmentally friendly vehicle and or to develop self driving technology however we believe that the unique feature of our vehicle the safety aspect of each of our vehicle our constant innovation our growing brand the increased affordability introduced with model the innovation and expansion of our global retail service and charging operation and infrastructure and our future vehicle will continue to generate incremental demand for our vehicle by making our vehicle accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and commercial market model wa the best selling premium vehicle in the united state in vehicle traded in to by model customer continue to suggest the existence of wider addressable market for this vehicle than existing owner of mid sized premium sedan moreover we have offered only the long range mid range and performance variant of model thus far we believe that we will see increased demand with the introduction of le expensive variant such version with base price of that we intend to offer in the future and additional financing option we commenced in january production of model for europe and china each of which we believe ha much larger mid sized premium sedan market than north america where we have exclusively delivered model to date we also believe that we have an advantage over our competitor with respect to our battery and powertrain technology our vehicle epa rated range per kwh is expected to be superior to that of other electric vehicle to be introduced in the near term and we have the ability to improve our vehicle through over the air software update we are producing variant including regional version of model in accordance with the demand that we expect for them however and we have finite production capability with long lead time associated with procuring certain part if our model demand expectation prove inaccurate or we experience delay in introducing planned additional variant including we begin offering model in new market we may not be able to timely generate sale matched to the specific vehicle that we have the capacity to produce we may also be impacted by trade policy political uncertainty and economic cycle involving geographic region where we have significant operation sale of vehicle in the automotive industry also tend to be cyclical in many market which may expose to increased volatility we expand and adjust our operation and retail strategy in addition the federal tax credit for the purchase of qualified electric vehicle in the wa reduced to for any tesla vehicle delivered during the first or second quarter of and will be further reduced to for each tesla vehicle delivered in the third or fourth quarter of and to for each tesla vehicle delivered thereafter we believe that this phase out likely pulled forward some vehicle demand into and could create similar pull forward in before each further step reduction in the federal tax credit in the long run we do not expect meaningful impact to our sale in the we believe that each of our vehicle model offer compelling proposition even without incentive globally we are also working to and in some case have already begun to increase the value proposition and affordability of our offering to customer and offer other financing arrangement over time for example we intend to introduce leasing option for model our model production ramped dramatically during and we expect to continue to grow model production to sustained rate of vehicle per week at our tesla factory by the end of we ramp international delivery we remain focused on further cost improvement and on increasing the affordability of model furthermore in january we commenced construction of our gigafactory shanghai in china we expect to build production process that is optimized and simplified for model production comprised of stamping body joining and paint shop and general assembly at gigafactory shanghai to begin production of certain trim of model for china by the end of we believe that the efficiency of local production well avoiding certain tariff on manufactured vehicle will allow to offer model at lower average selling price in the largest market for electric vehicle in the world inclusive of gigafactory shanghai our goal is to be able to produce model vehicle per week on sustained basis and an annualized output rate in excess of model vehicle sometime between the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of however the timeframe for gigafactory shanghai is subject to number of uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online ultimately achieving increased model production cost effectively will require that we timely address any additional bottleneck that may arise we continue to ramp and establish sustained supplier capacity including locally at gigafactory shanghai we also recently discontinued new custom order for the kwh version of model and model to focus on longer range version of our highest performance flagship vehicle and further differentiate them from model we have gradually increased the level of option standardization across these model and this latest step and our increasing production efficiency have allowed to reduce the production hour for them while preserving the flexibility to increase output necessary model and model are produced in the for the foreseeable future we could be impacted by increased import duty on component sourced from china well by tariff on vehicle exported to china although we intend to partially divert such delivery to north america and europe if necessary advancing our customer facing infrastructure remains top priority delivering vehicle to our customer and the related logistics were challenging during but we continue to improve these process to maximize customer satisfaction including by purchasing our own car hauling truck we are also expanding our servicing capability for our rapidly growing customer vehicle fleet including by growing our service location and mobile service fleet moving to two shift operation at service center where needed and optimizing our part distribution network we are also updating the tesla mobile app for scheduling service appointment in order to increase customer convenience sale of tesla vehicle ramp further we plan to continue to open new tesla retail location service center and body shop around the world and we plan to continue to expand our mobile service fleet we also plan to continue to significantly increase the number of supercharger and destination charging connector globally well evolve our supercharger technology to enable faster charging time while reducing our related cost however we will have to stabilize and sustain our delivery and logistics model to deliver an increasing number of vehicle and we have only limited experience with this at scale particularly in market outside of north america moreover if our growing fleet of customer vehicle particularly model experience unexpected reliability issue it could overburden our servicing capability finally we are making progress with our self driving technology well the autopilot feature in our vehicle our neural net and functionality continue to improve and we frequently release minor software update and from time to time release key version update recently we launched navigate on autopilot feature that allows enabled tesla vehicle under appropriate circumstance and driver input to change lane transition between freeway and exit freeway while we are subject to regulatory constraint over which we have no control our ultimate goal is to achieve full autonomy additionally there is growing competition from other automobile and technology company in the area of self driving energy generation and storage demand production and deployment we are continuing to reduce customer acquisition cost of our energy generation product transitioning away from former channel partner and shifting our sale strategy significantly to sell these product in tesla store and on our website and through cross selling opportunity to our expanding base of vehicle owner we continue to implement this strategy we expect that our retrofit solar system deployment will decrease slightly before stabilizing and growing in the second half of the year including through cross selling opportunity to our expanding base of vehicle owner our emphasis for retrofit solar product remains on executing project for upfront cash generation and profitability rather than absolute volume growth such by reducing the mix of leased system and prioritizing residential installation that are combined with our energy storage product we are continuing with the design iteration and testing on our solar roof product and we are continuing installation at slow pace with the expectation that we will ramp production with significantly improved manufacturing capability during we expect our energy storage product to continue to experience significant growth and we are targeting to more than double our deployment to over gwh in we see opportunity in north america well in australia and europe where energy storage coupled with solar generation may mitigate typically higher electricity rate well for project to increase energy grid reliability we are continuing to ramp production for these product at gigafactory including through new production line and we have seen further manufacturing efficiency and improvement in our installation process we ramp trend in cash flow capital expenditure and operating expense capital expenditure in are projected to be approximately billion mostly to support increase in model production capacity at gigafactory and the tesla factory the establishment of model production capacity at gigafactory shanghai and the addition of manufacturing capacity for model which we intend to produce in volume by the end of well the ongoing expansion of our retail location service center body shop mobile service fleet and supercharger station generally we expect operating expense percentage of revenue to continue to decrease in the future due to increase in expected revenue and we focus on increasing operational efficiency in addition due to our cost management effort to maximize operational efficiency we expect operating expense in to grow by le than from in march our stockholder approved new year ceo performance award for elon musk with vesting contingent on achieving market capitalization and operational milestone the ceo performance award consequently we may incur significant additional non cash stock based compensation expense over the term of the award each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting automotive financing option we offer financing arrangement for our vehicle in certain market in north america europe and asia primarily through various financial institution we offer resale value guarantee or similar buy back term to certain customer who purchase vehicle and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partner we also offer resale value guarantee in connection with automotive sale to certain leasing partner currently both program are available only in certain international market resale value guarantee available for exercise within the month following december totaled million in value we have adopted the new revenue recognition standard asc effective january this impact the way we account for vehicle sale with resale value guarantee and vehicle leased through our leasing partner which now generally qualify to be accounted for sale with right of return in addition for certain vehicle sale with resale value guarantee and vehicle leased through leasing partner prior to we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in and record the associated cumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach vehicle delivery with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near term cash flow and liquidity since we receive the full amount of cash for the vehicle sale price at delivery while we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer if customer exercise the option to return the vehicle to we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicle under these program may be lower than our guarantee or the volume of vehicle returned to may be higher than our estimate or we may be unable to resell the used vehicle in timely manner all of which could adversely impact our cash flow to date we have only had an insignificant number of customer who exercised their resale value guarantee and returned their vehicle to based on current market demand for our vehicle we estimate the resale price for our vehicle will continue to be above our resale value guarantee amount but resale price may inherently fluctuate depending on various factor such supply and demand of our used vehicle economic cycle and the pricing of new vehicle should market value of our vehicle or customer demand decrease these estimate may be impacted materially we currently offer model and model leasing directly through our local subsidiary in the and canada we also offer leasing through leasing partner in certain jurisdiction leasing through our captive financing entity and our leasing partner expose to residual value risk in addition for lease offered directly from our captive financing entity we assume customer credit risk we plan to continue expanding our financing offering including our lease financing option and the financial source to support them and to support the overall financing need of our customer to the extent that we are unable to arrange such option for our customer on term that are attractive our sale financial result and cash flow could be negatively impacted energy generation and storage financing option we offer our customer the choice to either purchase and own solar energy system or to purchase the energy that our solar energy system produce through various contractual arrangement these contractual arrangement include long term lease and ppas in both structure we install our solar energy system at our customer premise and charge the customer monthly fee in the lease structure this monthly payment is fixed with minimum production guarantee in the ppa structure we charge customer fee per kilowatt hour or kwh based on the amount of electricity the solar energy system actually produce the lease and ppas are typically for year with renewal option and the specified monthly fee are subject to annual escalation for customer who want to purchase and own solar energy system we also offer solar loan whereby third party lender provides financing directly to qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own solar energy system designed installed and serviced by we enter into standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer separately the customer enters into loan agreement with third party lender who finance the full purchase price we are not party to the loan agreement between the customer and the third party lender and the third party lender ha no recourse against with respect to the loan gigafactory we continue to develop gigafactory facility where we work together with our supplier to integrate production of battery material cell module battery pack and drive unit in one location for vehicle and energy storage product we also continue to invest in the future expansion of gigafactory and in additional production capacity there for example we have announced that we will likely manufacture model at gigafactory panasonic ha partnered with on gigafactory with investment in the production equipment that it us to manufacture and supply with battery cell under our arrangement with panasonic we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment at negotiated price these term convey to the right to use defined in asc lease their production equipment we consider them to be leased asset when production commences this result in recording the value of their production equipment within property plant and equipment net on the consolidated balance sheet with corresponding liability recorded to financing obligation for all supplier and partner for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production equipment located at gigafactory we will apply similar accounting during the year ended december we recorded million on the consolidated balance sheet while we currently believe that our progress at gigafactory will allow to reach our production target our ultimate ability to do so will require to resolve the type of challenge that are typical of production ramp for example we have in the past experienced bottleneck in the assembly of battery module at gigafactory which negatively affected our production of model while we continue to resolve such issue at gigafactory they arise given the size and complexity of this undertaking it is possible that future event could result in the cost of building and operating gigafactory exceeding our current expectation and gigafactory taking longer to expand than we currently anticipate gigafactory we have an agreement with the suny foundation for the construction of factory with the intended capacity to produce at least gw of solar product annually in buffalo new york referred to gigafactory in december we entered into an agreement with panasonic under which it manufacture custom pv cell and module for primarily at gigafactory and we purchase certain quantity of pv cell and module from panasonic during the year term the term of our agreement with the suny foundation require to comply with number of covenant and any failure to comply with these covenant could obligate to pay significant amount to the suny foundation and result in termination of the agreement although we remain on track with our progress at gigafactory our expectation to the cost of building the facility acquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operation may prove incorrect which could subject to significant expense to achieve the desired benefit gigafactory shanghai we are constructing gigafactory shanghai in order to significantly increase the affordability of model for customer in china by reducing transportation and manufacturing cost and eliminating certain tariff on vehicle imported from the we broke ground in january and subject to number of uncertainty including regulatory approval supply chain constraint and the pace of installing production equipment and bringing the factory online we expect to begin production of certain trim of model at gigafactory shanghai by the end of we expect much of the investment in gigafactory shanghai to be provided through local debt financing supported by limited direct capital expenditure by moreover we are targeting the capital expenditure per unit of production capacity at this factory to be le than that of our model production at the tesla factory from which we have drawn learning that should allow to simplify our manufacturing layout and process at gigafactory shanghai other manufacturing we continue to expand production capacity at our existing facility and construct our planned facility and continually explore additional production capacity internationally critical accounting policy and estimate the consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with accounting principle generally accepted in the gaap the preparation of the consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure we base our estimate on historical experience appropriate and on various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance change in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period accordingly actual result could differ significantly from the estimate made by our management we evaluate our estimate and assumption on an ongoing basis to the extent that there are material difference between these estimate and actual result our future financial statement presentation financial condition result of operation and cash flow will be affected we believe that the following critical accounting policy involve greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policy accordingly these are the policy we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating the consolidated financial condition and result of operation revenue recognition adoption of new revenue standard on january we adopted asc revenue from contract with customer new revenue standard using the modified retrospective method the new revenue standard had material impact in our consolidated financial statement for further discussion refer to note summary of significant accounting policy to the consolidated financial statement included elsewhere in this annual report on form automotive segment automotive sale revenue automotive sale without resale value guarantee automotive sale revenue includes revenue related to delivery of new vehicle and specific other feature and service that meet the definition of performance obligation under the new revenue standard including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full self driving and over the air software update we recognize revenue on automotive sale upon delivery to the customer which is when the control of vehicle transfer payment are typically received at the point control transfer or in accordance with payment term customary to the business other feature and service such access to our supercharger network internet connectivity and over the air software update are provisioned upon control transfer of vehicle and recognized over time on straight line basis we have stand ready obligation to deliver such service to the customer we recognize revenue related to these other feature and service over the performance period which is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight year life of the vehicle revenue related to autopilot and full self driving feature is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer for our obligation related to automotive sale we estimate standalone selling price by considering cost used to develop and deliver the service third party pricing of similar option and other information that may be available at the time of revenue recognition we reduce the transaction price and record reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future product return such estimate are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all period presented in addition any fee that are paid or payable by to customer lender when we arrange the financing are recognized an offset against automotive sale revenue cost to obtain contract mainly relate to commission paid to our sale personnel for the sale of vehicle commission are not paid on other obligation such access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full self driving and over the air software update our contract cost related to automotive sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred amount billed to customer related to shipping and handling are classified automotive revenue and we have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicle part or accessory have transferred to the customer an expense in cost of revenue our policy is to exclude tax collected from customer from the transaction price of automotive contract automotive sale with resale value guarantee we offer resale value guarantee or similar buy back term to certain international customer who purchase vehicle and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partner we also offer resale value guarantee in connection with automotive sale to certain leasing partner under these program we receive full payment for the vehicle sale price at the time of delivery and our counterparty ha the option of selling their vehicle back to during the guarantee period which currently is generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program for pre determined resale value with the exception of two program which are discussed within the automotive leasing section we now recognize revenue when control transfer upon delivery to customer in accordance with the new revenue standard sale with right of return we do not believe the customer ha significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them the process to determine whether there is significant economic incentive includes comparison of vehicle estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer economic incentive to exercise the performance obligation and the pattern of recognizing automotive sale with resale value guarantee are consistent with automotive sale without resale value guarantee with the exception of our estimate for sale return reserve sale return reserve for automotive sale with resale value guarantee are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future market value the two program that are still being recorded operating lease are discussed in further detail below in vehicle sale to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option and vehicle sale to customer with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all transaction with resale value guarantee were recorded operating lease the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee wa deferred until the guarantee expired or wa exercised for certain transaction that were considered interest bearing collateralized borrowing required under asc lease we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate the remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay off of the initial loan we capitalized the cost of these vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet operating lease vehicle net and depreciated their value le estimated residual value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period in case where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balance related to the vehicle were settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle wa expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if our counterparty returned the vehicle to during the guarantee period we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining deferred balance to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassified the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory automotive regulatory credit california and certain other state have law in place requiring vehicle manufacturer to ensure that portion of the vehicle delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicle these law and regulation provide that manufacturer of zero emission vehicle may earn regulatory credit zev credit and may sell excess credit to other manufacturer who apply such credit to comply with these regulatory requirement similar regulation exist at the federal level that require compliance related to greenhouse gas ghg emission and also allow for the sale of excess credit by one manufacturer to other manufacturer manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicle we have earned emission credit such zev and ghg credit on our vehicle and we expect to continue to earn these credit in the future we enter into contractual agreement with third party to purchase our regulatory credit payment for regulatory credit are typically received at the point control transfer to the customer or in accordance with payment term customary to the business we recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credit at the time control of the regulatory credit is transferred to the purchasing party automotive revenue in the consolidated statement of operation automotive leasing revenue automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting guidance for our direct leasing program well the two program with resale value guarantee which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard all program with resale value guarantee were accounted for operating lease direct vehicle leasing program we have outstanding lease under our direct vehicle leasing program in certain location in the canada and europe currently the direct vehicle leasing program is only offered for new lease to qualified customer in the and canada qualifying customer are permitted to lease vehicle directly from tesla for up to month at the end of the lease term customer have the option of either returning the vehicle to or purchasing it for pre determined residual value we account for these leasing transaction operating lease we record leasing revenue to automotive leasing revenue on straight line basis over the contractual term and we record the depreciation of these vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue we capitalize shipping cost and initial direct cost such the incremental cost of contract administration referral fee and sale commission from the origination of automotive lease agreement an element of operating lease vehicle net and subsequently amortize these cost over the term of the related lease agreement our policy is to exclude tax collected from customer from the transaction price of automotive contract vehicle sale to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option we offer buyback option in connection with automotive sale with resale value guarantee to certain leasing partner sale in the united state these transaction entail transfer of lease which we have originated with an end customer to our leasing partner control of the vehicle ha not been transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard these transaction continue to be accounted for interest bearing collateralized borrowing in accordance with asc lease under this program cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally recorded within resale value guarantee and the customer upfront deposit is recorded within deferred revenue we amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue on straight line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate we capitalize vehicle under this program to operating lease vehicle net on the consolidated balance sheet and we record depreciation from these vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under lease arrangement cash received for these vehicle net of revenue recognized during the period is classified collateralized lease repayment borrowing within cash flow from financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flow at the end of the lease term we settle our liability in cash by either purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or paying shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the sale of the vehicle any remaining balance within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue in case where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue on quarterly basis we ass the estimated market value of vehicle under our buyback option program to determine if we have sustained loss on any of these contract we accumulate more data related to the buyback value of our vehicle or market condition change there may be material change to their estimated value although we have not experienced any material loss during any period to date vehicle sale to customer with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable for certain international program where we have offered resale value guarantee to certain customer who purchased vehicle and where we expect the customer ha significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them we continue to recognize these transaction operating lease the process to determine whether there is significant economic incentive includes comparison of vehicle estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer economic incentive to exercise we have not sold any vehicle under this program since the first half of and all current period activity relates to the exercise or cancellation of active transaction the amount of sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised the remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on straight line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue the guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay off of the initial loan we capitalize the cost of these vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet operating lease vehicle net and depreciate their value le salvage value to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period in case where customer retains ownership of vehicle at the end of the guarantee period the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining deferred revenue balance related to the vehicle are settled to automotive leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue if customer return the vehicle to during the guarantee period we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balance to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory service and other revenue service and other revenue consists of non warranty after sale vehicle service sale of used vehicle sale of electric vehicle component and system to other manufacturer retail merchandise and sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer there were no significant change to the timing or amount of revenue recognition result of our adoption of the new revenue standard revenue related to repair and maintenance service are recognized over time service are provided and extended service plan are recognized over the performance period of the service contract the obligation represents stand ready obligation to the customer we sell used vehicle service service plan vehicle component and merchandise separately and thus use standalone selling price the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these item are sold in transaction with other performance obligation payment for used vehicle service and merchandise are typically received at the point when control transfer to the customer or in accordance with payment term customary to the business payment received for prepaid plan are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contract and are included within customer deposit on the consolidated balance sheet energy generation and storage segment energy generation and storage sale energy generation and storage revenue consists of the sale of solar energy system and energy storage system to residential small commercial and large commercial and utility grade customer sale of solar energy system to residential and small scale commercial customer consist of the engineering design and installation of the system post installation residential and small scale commercial customer receive proprietary monitoring system that capture and display historical energy generation data residential and small scale commercial customer pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control transfer which is when we install solar energy system and the system pass inspection by the utility or the authority jurisdiction revenue for the monitoring service is recognized ratably stand ready obligation over the warranty period of the solar energy system sale of energy storage system to residential and small scale commercial customer consist of the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered or if we are performing installation when installed and accepted by the customer payment for such storage system is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment term customary to the business for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customer make milestone payment that are consistent with contract specific phase of project revenue from such contract is recognized over time using percentage of completion method based on cost incurred percentage of total estimated contract cost certain large scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale also include operation and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contract and are thus considered to be combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system where percentage of completion method doe not apply revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered to the customer for energy storage system and when the project ha received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy system operation and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term customer payment for such service are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance in instance where there are multiple performance obligation in single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligation in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling price are estimated based on estimated cost plus margin or using market data for comparable product cost incurred on the sale of residential installation before the solar energy system are completed are included work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheet however any fee that are paid or payable by to solar loan lender would be recognized an offset against revenue cost to obtain contract relate mainly to commission paid to our sale personnel related to the sale of solar energy system and energy storage system our contract cost related to solar energy system and energy storage system sale are typically fulfilled within one year the cost to obtain contract are expensed incurred part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contract we may provide the customer with performance guarantee that warrant that the underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention requirement specified in the contract in certain instance we may receive bonus payment if the system performs above specified level conversely if solar energy system or energy storage system doe not meet the performance guarantee requirement we may be required to pay liquidated damage other form of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contract include variable customer payment that will be made based on our energy market participation activity such guarantee and variable customer payment represent form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period additional performance data becomes available such estimate are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable significant reversal of revenue will not occur we record deferred revenue any non refundable amount that are collected from customer related to fee charged for prepayment and remote monitoring service and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term energy generation and storage leasing for revenue arrangement where we are the lessor under operating lease agreement for energy generation and storage product we record lease revenue from minimum lease payment including upfront rebate and incentive earned from such system on straight line basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met the difference between the payment received and the revenue recognized is recorded deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet for solar energy system where customer purchase electricity from under ppas we have determined that these agreement should be accounted for operating lease pursuant to asc revenue is recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rate specified under the contract assuming all other revenue recognition criterion are met we record deferred revenue any amount that are collected from customer including lease prepayment in excess of revenue recognized and operation and maintenance service which is recognized revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebate and incentive received from utility company and various local and state government agency which is recognized revenue over the lease term we capitalize initial direct cost from the origination of solar energy system lease or ppas which include the incremental cost of contract administration referral fee and sale commission an element of solar energy system leased and to be leased net and subsequently amortize these cost over the term of the related lease or ppa inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system is recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about on current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle production powertrain component and system and energy storage product we sell in addition we also provide warranty on the installation and component of the solar energy system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall when identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new revenue standard automotive sale with resale value guarantee that were previously recorded within operating lease asset require corresponding warranty accrual warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation stock based compensation we use the fair value method of accounting for our stock option and restricted stock unit rsus granted to employee and our employee stock purchase plan the espp to measure the cost of employee service received in exchange for the stock based award the fair value of stock option award with only service condition and espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes option pricing model requires input such the risk free interest rate expected term and expected volatility these input are subjective and generally require significant judgment the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock the resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period which is generally four year for stock option and rsus and six month for the espp stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis net of actual forfeiture in the period prior to net of estimated projected forfeiture for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performance based award with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market condition stock based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market condition over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market condition beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement the fair value of such award is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulation we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation income tax we are subject to federal and state tax in the and in many foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax our deferred tax asset and liability and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax asset we make these estimate and judgment about our future taxable income that are based on assumption that are consistent with our future plan tax law regulation and administrative practice may be subject to change due to economic or political condition including fundamental change to the tax law applicable to corporate multinationals the many country in the european union and number of other country are actively considering change in this regard of december we had recorded full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax asset will not be realized in the foreseeable future should the actual amount differ from our estimate the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted furthermore significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position in the ordinary course of business there are many transaction and calculation for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain result we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attribute based on our estimate of the eventual outcome these effect are recognized when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority we are required to file income tax return in the and various foreign jurisdiction which requires to interpret the applicable tax law and regulation in effect in such jurisdiction such return are subject to audit by the various federal state and foreign taxing authority who may disagree with respect to our tax position we believe that our consideration is adequate for all open audit year based on our assessment of many factor including past experience and interpretation of tax law we review and update our estimate in light of changing fact and circumstance such the closing of tax audit the lapse of statute of limitation or change in estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter differs from our expectation such difference may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made the eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax asset in the period that such determination is made on december the tax cut and job act tax act wa enacted into law making significant change to the internal revenue code change include but are not limited to federal corporate tax rate decrease from to for tax year beginning after december the transition of international taxation from worldwide tax system to territorial system and one time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we were required to recognize the effect of the tax law change in the period of enactment such measuring our deferred tax asset and liability well reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax asset and liability the tax act not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operation due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset in december the security and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no income tax accounting implication of the tax cut and job act sab which allowed to record provisional amount during measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date such in accordance with sab we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no material adjustment from the provisional amount recorded during the prior year principle of consolidation the consolidated financial statement reflect our account and operation and those of our subsidiary in which we have controlling financial interest in accordance with the provision of asc consolidation we consolidate any variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary we form vies with our financing fund investor in the ordinary course of business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attribute associated with our solar energy system and lease under our direct vehicle leasing program the typical condition for controlling financial interest ownership is holding majority of the voting interest of an entity however controlling financial interest may also exist in entity such vies through arrangement that do not involve controlling voting interest asc requires variable interest holder to consolidate vie if that party ha the power to direct the activity of the vie that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and the obligation to absorb loss of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefit from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie we do not consolidate vie in which we have majority ownership interest when we are not considered the primary beneficiary we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of number of vies we evaluate our relationship with all the vies on an ongoing basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary all intercompany transaction and balance have been eliminated upon consolidation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we enter into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset business combination we account for business acquisition under asc business combination the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured the fair value of the asset given equity instrument issued and liability assumed at the acquisition date cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed incurred identifiable asset including intangible asset liability assumed including contingent liability and noncontrolling interest in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed we recognize bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operation if the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest we include the result of operation of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statement beginning on the acquisition date when determining such fair value we make significant estimate and assumption critical estimate include but are not limited to future expected cash flow from the underlying asset and discount rate our estimate of fair value is based on assumption believed to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable result actual result may differ from our estimate furthermore our estimate might change additional information becomes available more fully discussed in note business combination included elsewhere in this annual report on form result of operation revenue year ended december change change dollar in thousand automotive sale automotive leasing total automotive revenue service and other total automotive service and other segment revenue energy generation and storage segment revenue total revenue automotive service and other segment automotive sale revenue includes revenue related to sale of new model model and model vehicle including access to our supercharger network internet connectivity autopilot full self driving and over the air software update well sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer our revenue from non zev regulatory credit generally follows our production and delivery trend we have long term contract with existing customer for the sale of these credit however we do not have long term contract for zev credit sale revenue from sale of zev credit fluctuate by quarter depending on when contract is executed with buyer for example our revenue from zev credit sale in the three month ended december wa million while it wa in the three month ended june automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for model and model vehicle under direct lease agreement well those sold with resale value guarantee accounted for operating lease under lease accounting we do not yet offer leasing for model vehicle service and other revenue consists of non warranty after sale vehicle service sale of used vehicle sale of electric vehicle component and system to other manufacturer retail merchandise and sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer compared to automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to an increase of approximately model delivery from our significant production ramp in the year ended december delivered at average selling price that remained relatively consistent year over year additionally we recognized billion of additional automotive sale revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard and an increase of million in sale of regulatory credit to million in the year ended december zev credit sale were million and non zev regulatory credit sale were million in the year ended december compared to million zev credit sale and million in non zev regulatory credit sale in the year ended december the growth in non zev regulatory credit year over year wa generally consistent with the delivery volume growth the above increase in revenue were offset by decrease of approximately model and model delivery during the year ended december excluding the impact of adoption of the new revenue standard at average selling price that remained relatively consistent compared to the year ended december automotive leasing revenue decreased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the decrease wa primarily due to downward adjustment of million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by an increase in cumulative vehicle under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicle under leasing program where our counterparty ha retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended december when our counterparty retains ownership any remaining balance within deferred revenue and resale value guarantee are settled to automotive leasing revenue service and other revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sale from an increased volume of trade in vehicle partially offset by lower average selling price for used vehicle sale due to an increase in trade in of relatively lower priced non tesla vehicle in the year ended december additionally there wa an increase in non warranty maintenance service revenue our fleet continues to grow these increase were partially offset by decrease in powertrain sale to another automobile manufacturer we wound down the program in compared to automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily related to increase in delivery to vehicle resulting from increased sale of model and model at average selling price that remained relatively consistent compared to the prior period well sale of model vehicle since it launch in the third quarter of additionally sale of regulatory credit increased by million to million in the year ended december zev credit sale were million and non zev regulatory credit sale were million in the year ended december compared to million zev credit sale and million in non zev regulatory credit sale in the year ended december the increase were partially offset by additional deferral of autopilot revenue in the year ended december automotive leasing revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to an approximately increase in the number of vehicle under leasing program or program with resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december in addition during the year ended december we recognized an increase of million of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december service and other revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this wa primarily due to an increase in used vehicle sale result of increased automotive sale well from the expansion of our trade in program additionally there wa million increase from the inclusion of engineering service revenue from grohmann engineering gmbh now tesla grohmann automation gmbh which we acquired on january and million increase in non warranty maintenance service revenue our fleet continued to grow during the year ended december energy generation and storage segment energy generation and storage revenue includes sale of solar energy system and energy storage product leasing revenue from solar energy system under operating lease and ppas and the sale of solar energy system incentive compared to energy generation and storage revenue increased by million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to increase in deployment of powerpack powerwall and cash and loan solar energy system project the increase in powerpack revenue wa significant year over year due to increase in revenue recognized for commercial project most predominantly million for the south australia battery project additionally we increased powerwall production in the year ended december which helped to continue to work through our energy storage order backlog compared to energy generation and storage revenue increased by million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december predominantly due to the inclusion of the full year of revenue from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november cost of

manufacturer and sale by our acquired subsidiary to third party customer compared to cost of automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to significantly higher volume of model vehicle delivery in and the recognition of million of additional cost of automotive sale revenue due to the adoption of the new revenue standard these increase were partially offset by significant reduction in model average cost per unit compared to the year ended december primarily due to temporary under utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volume in and other cost efficiency additionally there were lower overall cost for model and model cash delivery from approximately fewer unit delivered year over year and reduction in combined model and model average cost per unit result of increased manufacturing efficiency cost of automotive leasing revenue decreased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the decrease wa primarily due to downward adjustment of million from the adoption of the new revenue standard partially offset by increased cost of automotive leasing revenue from an increase in cumulative vehicle under our direct vehicle leasing program and an increase in the number of vehicle under leasing program where our counterparty ha retained ownership of the vehicle during or at the end of the guarantee period when compared to the year ended december when our counterparty retains ownership the net book value of the leased vehicle of the lease vehicle is expensed to cost of automotive leasing revenue cost of service and other revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the increase wa primarily due to the increase in the cost of our new service center additional service personnel in existing and new service center mobile service capability part distribution center and investment in new body shop to provide maintenance service to our rapidly growing fleet of vehicle additionally there wa an overall increase in the cost of used vehicle sale from the increased volume of relatively lower priced non tesla trade in vehicle these increase were partially offset by decrease in cost of powertrain sale to another automobile manufacturer we wound down the program in gross margin for total automotive remained relatively consistent at in the year ended december and there were increase from improved model and model combined margin cost per unit decreased year over year from continuing manufacturing efficiency and an increase in regulatory credit sale which have no associated cost the increase were partially offset by margin dilution from model despite model margin improving year over year the higher proportion of model percentage of our total automotive sale in the year ended december lowered our overall gross margin for total automotive model had lower annualized margin than model and model due to temporary under utilization of manufacturing capacity at lower production volume in the first half of and we have yet to achieve significant manufacturing efficiency in the production of model gross margin for total automotive service and other segment remained relatively consistent at in the year ended december and primarily due to the automotive gross margin impact discussed above service and other ha historically operated at lower margin than our automotive sale and leasing business but ha small impact on the overall segment margin because of it relatively small revenue base compared to cost of automotive sale revenue increased billion or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this wa primarily due to increase in vehicle delivery resulting from increased sale of model and model well the commencement of delivery of model in the third quarter of cost of automotive leasing revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this wa primarily due to an approximately increase in the number of vehicle under leasing program or program with resale value guarantee compared to the year ended december in addition during the year ended december we recognized an increase of million in cost of automotive leasing revenue upon early payoff and the expiration of resale value guarantee cost of service and other revenue increased million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december primarily due to the increase in cost of used vehicle sale due to increased volume and the increase in cost to provide maintenance service our fleet continues to grow gross margin for total automotive decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the commencement of delivery of model in the third quarter of whereby the full operating cost and depreciation were recorded at much lower production volume production ramp and increase in early payoff and expiration of resale value guarantee year over year contributed to the lower gross margin lower material and manufacturing cost for model and model we further improved our vehicle production process and the partial recognition of autopilot revenue in the year ended december partially offset the overall decrease gross margin for total automotive service and other segment decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december these decrease are driven by the factor impacting gross margin for total automotive explained above well higher cost of maintenance service energy generation and storage segment cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect material and labor cost warehouse rent freight warranty expense other overhead cost and amortization of certain acquired intangible asset in addition where arrangement are accounted for operating lease the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar energy system maintenance cost associated with those system and amortization of any initial direct cost compared to cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by

additionally cost for cash and loan solar energy system project have increased from higher installation cost higher allocation of overhead cost from lower deployment of solar project overall and certain warranty related one time charge there were also higher cost for our solar energy system leasing arrangement due to impairment charge and higher cost from temporary manufacturing under utilization of our solar roof ramp gross margin for energy generation and storage decreased from to in the year ended december compared to the year ended december the decrease wa primarily due to the higher proportion of energy storage of our overall energy generation and storage portfolio due to three fold growth of mwh of energy storage deployment in the year ended december although energy storage margin have improved significantly compared to the year ended december it continues to operate at lower margin than our solar business thereby having greater dilutive impact on our gross margin in the year ended december additionally increase in cost for our cash and loan solar energy system project impairment charge on solar energy system leasing arrangement and temporary manufacturing under utilization of our solar roof ramp have further contributed to the decrease in gross margin compared to cost of energy generation and storage revenue increased by million or in the year ended december compared to the year ended december this wa primarily due to the inclusion of the full year of cost from our solar business which we gained by acquiring solarcity on november gross

are predominately from our delivery of vehicle sale and installation of our energy storage product and solar energy system proceeds from debt facility proceeds from financing fund and proceeds from equity offering our source of liquidity and cash flow enable to fund ongoing operation research and development project for new product increase in model production capacity at the tesla factory the establishment of model production capacity at gigafactory shanghai the continued expansion of gigafactory the addition of manufacturing capacity for model with the expectation to achieve volume production by the end of and the continued expansion of our retail and service location body shop mobile service fleet and supercharger network we currently expect total capital expenditure to be approximately billion in we will continue to utilize our increasing experience and learning from past and current product ramp to do so at level of capital efficiency per dollar of spend that we expect to be significantly greater than historical level for example based on our experience with ramping model at the tesla factory we expect that the capital spend per unit of model manufacturing capacity at gigafactory shanghai will be le than that of our line in fremont likewise based on such experience and the substantial commonality of component we expect between model and model we believe that the production ramp of model will be significantly faster than that of model and cost le per unit of manufacturing capacity than that of model at fremont considering the pipeline of new product planned at this point and consistent with our current strategy of using partner to manufacture cell well considering all other infrastructure growth and expansion of gigafactory gigafactory and gigafactory shanghai we currently estimate that capital expenditure will be between to billion annually for the next two fiscal year moreover we expect that the cash we generate from our core operation will generally be sufficient to cover our future capital expenditure and to pay down our near term debt obligation including the repayment of million for our convertible senior note due on march although we may choose to seek alternative financing source for example we expect that much of our investment in gigafactory shanghai will be funded through indebtedness arranged through local financial institution in china always we continually evaluate our capital expenditure need and may decide it is best to raise additional capital to fund the rapid growth of our business we have an agreement to spend or incur billion in combined capital operational expense cost of good sold and other cost in the state of new york during the year period following full production at gigafactory we anticipate meeting these obligation through our operation at this facility and other operation within the state of new york and we do not believe that we face significant risk of default we expect that our current source of liquidity together with our projection of cash flow from operating activity will provide with adequate liquidity over at least the next month large portion of our future expenditure is to fund our growth and we can adjust our capital and operating expenditure by operating segment including future expansion of our product offering retail and service location body shop mobile service fleet and supercharger network we may need or want to raise additional fund in the future and these fund may not be available to when we need or want them or at all if we can not raise

by the customer payment for such storage system is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment term customary to the business for large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale which consist of the engineering design and installation of the system customer make milestone payment that are consistent with contract specific phase of project revenue from such contract is recognized over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred percentage of total estimated contract cost certain large scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sale also include operation and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and installation contract and are thus considered to be combined contract with the design and installation service for certain large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system where the percentage of completion method doe not apply revenue is recognized when control transfer which is when the product ha been delivered to the customer for energy storage system and when the project ha received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy system operation and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the respective contract term customer payment for such service are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance in instance where there are multiple performance obligation in single contract we allocate the consideration to the various obligation in the contract based on the relative standalone selling price method standalone selling price are estimated based on estimated cost plus margin or using market data for comparable product cost incurred on the sale of residential installation before the solar energy system are completed are included work in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheet however any fee that are paid or payable by to solar loan

original expected length of more than one year wa million of this amount we expect to recognize million in the next month and the remaining over period up to year energy generation and storage leasing for revenue arrangement where we are the lessor under operating lease agreement for energy generation and storage product we record lease revenue from minimum lease payment including upfront rebate and incentive earned from such system on straight line basis over the life of the lease term assuming all other revenue recognition criterion have been met the difference between the payment received and the revenue recognized is recorded deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet for solar energy system where customer purchase electricity from under power purchase agreement ppas we have

asset and liability method under which deferred tax asset and liability are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to affect taxable income valuation allowance are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax asset to the amount expected to be realized we record liability related to uncertain tax position when despite our belief that our tax return position are supportable we believe that it is more likely than not that those position may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authority accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are classified income tax expense comprehensive income loss comprehensive income loss is comprised of net income loss and other comprehensive income loss other comprehensive income loss consists of unrealized gain and loss on cash flow hedge and available for sale marketable security and foreign currency translation adjustment that have been excluded from the determination of net income loss stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for cost related to all share based payment including stock option restricted stock unit rsus and our employee stock purchase plan the espp the fair value of stock option award with only service condition and the espp is estimated on the grant or offering date using the black scholes option pricing model the fair value of rsus is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock stock based compensation expense is recognized on straight line basis over the requisite service period net of actual forfeiture in the period prior to net of estimated projected forfeiture stock based compensation associated with award assumed from the acquisition of solarcity corporation solarcity is measured of the acquisition date using the relevant assumption and recognized on straight line basis over the remaining requisite service period net of actual forfeiture in the period prior to net of estimated projected forfeiture for performance based award stock based compensation expense is recognized over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance milestone when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes probable for performance based award with vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance and market condition stock based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market condition over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance and market condition beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered probable of achievement the fair value of such award is estimated on the grant date using monte carlo simulation see note equity incentive plan we accumulate additional employee stock based award data over time and we incorporate market data related to our common stock we may calculate significantly different volatility and expected life which could materially impact the valuation of our stock based award and the stock based compensation expense that we will recognize in future period stock based compensation expense is recorded in cost of revenue research and development expense and selling general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operation noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest represent third party interest in the net asset under certain funding arrangement or fund that we enter into to finance the cost of solar energy system and vehicle under operating lease we have determined that the contractual provision of the fund represent substantive profit sharing arrangement we have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance that reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangement is balance sheet approach using the hypothetical liquidation at book value hlbv method we therefore determine the amount of the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the net asset of the fund at each balance sheet date using the hlbv method which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet noncontrolling interest in subsidiary and redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiary under the hlbv method the amount reported noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheet represent the amount the third party would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation provision of the fund assuming the net asset of the fund were liquidated at their recorded amount determined in accordance with gaap and with tax law effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third party the third party interest in the result of operation of the fund are determined the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balance in the consolidated balance sheet between the start and end of each reporting period after taking into account any capital transaction between the fund and the third party however the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these third party have the right to redeem their interest in the fund for cash or other asset net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder basic net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder is calculated by dividing net income loss attributable to common stockholder by the weighted average share of common stock outstanding for the period potentially dilutive share which are based on the weighted average share of common stock underlying outstanding stock based award warrant and convertible senior note using the treasury stock method or the if converted method applicable are included when calculating diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder when their effect is dilutive since we intend to settle in cash the principal outstanding under the convertible senior note due in the convertible senior note due in and the convertible senior note due in we use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect if any furthermore in connection with the offering of our bond hedge we entered into convertible note hedge see note long term debt obligation however our convertible note hedge are not included when calculating potentially dilutive share since their effect is always anti dilutive the following table present the potentially dilutive share that were excluded from the computation of diluted net income loss per share of common stock attributable to common stockholder because their effect wa anti dilutive year ended december stock based award convertible senior note warrant business combination we account for business acquisition under asc business combination the total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured the fair value of the asset given equity instrument issued and liability assumed at the acquisition date cost that are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed incurred identifiable asset including intangible asset liability assumed including contingent liability and noncontrolling interest in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair value at the acquisition date we recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest is in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed we recognize bargain purchase gain within other income expense net on the consolidated statement of operation if the net fair value of the identifiable asset acquired and the liability assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interest we include the result of operation of the acquired business in the consolidated financial statement beginning on the acquisition date cash and cash equivalent all highly liquid investment with an original maturity of three month or le at the

the table above account receivable and allowance for doubtful account account receivable primarily include amount related to sale of powertrain system sale of energy generation and storage product receivables from financial institution and leasing company offering various financing product to our customer sale of regulatory credit to other automotive manufacturer and maintenance service on vehicle owned by leasing company we provide an allowance against account receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected we write off account receivable when they are deemed uncollectible we typically do not carry significant account receivable related to our vehicle and related sale customer payment are due prior to vehicle delivery except for amount due from commercial financial institution for approved financing arrangement between our customer and the financial institution mypower customer note receivable we have customer note receivable under the legacy mypower loan program mypower wa offered by solarcity to provide residential customer with the option to finance the purchase of solar energy system through year loan the outstanding balance net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amount are presented on the consolidated balance sheet component of prepaid expense and other current asset for the current portion and mypower customer note receivable net of current portion for the long term portion in determining the allowance and credit quality for customer note receivable we identify significant customer with known dispute or collection issue and also consider our historical level of credit loss and current economic trend that might impact the level of future credit loss customer note receivable that are individually impaired are charged off write off of the allowance for loss since acquisition there have been no new significant customer with known dispute or collection issue and the amount of potentially uncollectible amount ha been insignificant in addition there were no material non accrual or past due customer note receivable of december concentration of risk credit risk financial instrument that potentially subject to concentration of credit risk consist of cash cash equivalent restricted cash account receivable convertible note hedge and interest rate swap our cash balance are primarily invested in money market fund or on deposit at high credit quality financial institution in the these deposit are typically in excess of insured limit of december and no entity represented or more of our total account receivable balance the risk of concentration for our interest rate swap is mitigated by transacting with several highly rated multinational bank supply risk we are dependent on our supplier the majority of which are single source supplier and the inability of these supplier to deliver necessary component of our product in timely manner at price quality level and volume acceptable to or our inability to efficiently manage these component from these supplier could have material adverse effect on our business prospect financial condition and operating result inventory valuation inventory are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is computed using standard cost for vehicle and energy storage product which approximates actual cost on first in first out basis in addition cost for solar energy system is recorded using actual cost we record inventory write down for excess or obsolete inventory based upon assumption about on current and future demand forecast if our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast the excess amount are written off we also review our inventory to determine whether it carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory this requires to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicle le the estimated cost to convert the inventory on hand into finished product once inventory is written down new lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent change in fact and circumstance do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis should our estimate of future selling price or production cost change additional and potentially material increase to this reserve may be required small change in our estimate may result in material charge to our reported financial result operating lease vehicle vehicle that are leased part of our direct vehicle leasing program vehicle delivered to leasing partner with resale value guarantee and buyback option well vehicle delivered to customer with resale value guarantee where exercise is probable are classified operating lease vehicle the related revenue

energy system under lease that qualify operating lease our lease are accounted for in accordance with asc to determine lease classification we evaluate the lease term to determine whether there is transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease whether the lease term is greater than of the useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payment exceed of the fair value at lease inception we utilize periodic appraisal to estimate useful life and fair value at lease inception and residual value at lease termination solar energy system are stated at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows solar energy system leased to customer to year initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost lease term up to year solar energy system held for lease to customer are installed system pending interconnection with the respective utility company and will be depreciated solar energy system leased to customer when they have been interconnected and placed in service solar energy system under construction represents system that are under installation which will be depreciated solar energy system leased to customer when they are completed interconnected and leased to customer initial direct cost related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition cost are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer lease agreement property plant and equipment property plant and equipment including leasehold improvement are recognized at cost le accumulated depreciation depreciation is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the respective asset follows machinery equipment vehicle and office furniture to year building and building improvement to year computer equipment and software to year depreciation for tooling is computed using the unit of production method whereby capitalized cost are amortized over the total estimated productive life of the respective asset of december the estimated productive life for model and model tooling wa vehicle based on our current estimate of production of december the estimated productive life for model tooling wa vehicle based on our current estimate of production leasehold improvement are depreciated on straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the term of the related lease upon the retirement or sale of our property plant and equipment the cost and associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement of operation maintenance and repair expenditure are expensed incurred while major improvement that increase the functionality output or expected life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified useful life interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant capital asset construction capitalized interest on construction in progress is included within property plant and equipment and is amortized over the life of the related asset furthermore we are deemed to be the owner for accounting purpose during the construction phase of certain long lived asset under build to suit lease arrangement because of our involvement with the construction our exposure to any potential cost overrun or our other commitment under the arrangement in these case we recognize build to suit lease asset under construction and corresponding build to suit lease liability on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with asc once construction is completed if lease meet certain sale leaseback criterion we remove the asset and liability and account for the lease an operating lease otherwise the lease is accounted for capital lease long lived asset including acquired intangible asset we review our property plant and equipment long term prepayment and intangible asset for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable we measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow that the asset is expected to generate if the asset is not recoverable it carrying amount would be adjusted down to it fair value for the year ended december we have recognized certain material impairment of our long lived asset refer to note intangible asset for further detail for the year ended december and we have recognized no material impairment of our long lived asset intangible asset with definite life are amortized on straight line basis over their estimated useful life which range from two to thirty year capitalization of software cost for cost incurred in development of internal use software we capitalize cost incurred during the application development stage cost related to preliminary project activity and post implementation activity are expensed incurred internal use software is amortized on straight line basis over it estimated useful life of three to ten year we evaluate the useful life of these asset on an annual basis and we test for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance occur that could impact the recoverability of these asset foreign currency we determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international subsidiary and their operating division based on the primary currency in which they operate in case where the functional currency is not the dollar we recognize cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rate we apply to accumulated deficit including current period income or loss and the balance sheet for each subsidiary we apply the monthly average functional currency rate to it income or loss and the month end functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet foreign currency transaction gain and loss are result of the effect of exchange rate change on transaction denominated in currency other than the functional currency transaction gain and loss are recognized in other income expense net in the consolidated statement of operation for the year ended december and we recorded foreign currency transaction gain of million loss of million and gain of million respectively warranty we provide manufacturer warranty on all new and used vehicle production powertrain component and system and energy storage product we sell in addition we also provide warranty on the installation and component of the solar energy system we sell for period typically between to year we accrue warranty reserve for the product sold by which includes our best estimate of the projected cost to repair or replace item under warranty and recall when identified these estimate are based on actual claim incurred to date and an estimate of the nature frequency and cost of future claim these estimate are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sale and change to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material change to the warranty reserve in the future the warranty reserve doe not include projected warranty cost associated with our vehicle subject to lease accounting and our solar energy system under lease contract or ppas the cost to repair these warranty claim are expensed incurred the portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next month is included within accrued liability and other while the remaining balance is included within other long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet due to the adoption of the new revenue standard automotive sale with resale value guarantee that were previously recorded within operating lease asset require corresponding warranty accrual which is included in the table below warranty expense is recorded component of cost of revenue in the consolidated statement of operation accrued warranty activity consisted of the following in thousand year ended december accrued warranty beginning of period assumed warranty liability from acquisition warranty cost incurred net change in liability for pre existing warranty including expiration and foreign exchange impact additional warranty accrued from adoption of the new revenue standard provision for warranty accrued warranty end of period for the year ended december and warranty cost incurred for vehicle accounted for operating lease or collateralized debt arrangement were million million and million respectively solar energy system performance guarantee we guarantee specified minimum solar energy production output for certain solar energy system leased or sold to customer generally for term of up to year we monitor the solar energy system to ensure that these output are being achieved we evaluate if any amount are due to our customer and make any payment periodically specified in the customer agreement of december and we had recognized liability of million and million respectively within accrued liability and other on the consolidated balance sheet related to these guarantee based on our assessment of the exposure solar renewable energy credit we account for solar renewable energy credit srecs when they are purchased by or sold to third party for srecs generated by solar energy system owned by and minted by government agency we do not recognize any specifically identifiable cost there are no specific incremental cost incurred to generate the srecs for srecs purchased by we record these srecs at their cost subject to impairment testing we recognize revenue from the sale of an srec when the srec is transferred to the buyer and the cost of the srec if any is then recorded to cost of revenue deferred investment tax credit revenue we have solar energy system that are eligible for itcs that accrue to eligible property under the internal revenue code irc under section of the irc and the related regulation lessor of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee the owner of such property for the purpose of claiming the itcs associated with such property these regulation enable the itcs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the itcs under our lease pas through fund arrangement we can make tax election to pas through the itcs to the investor who are the legal lessee of the property therefore we are able to monetize these itcs to the investor who can utilize them in return for cash payment we consider the monetization of itcs to constitute one of the key element of realizing the value associated with solar energy system consequently we consider the proceeds from the monetization of itcs to be component of revenue generated from solar energy system in accordance with the relevant fasb guidance we recognize revenue from the monetization of itcs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery ha occurred or service have been rendered the sale price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured an itc is subject to recapture under the irc if the underlying solar energy system either cease to be qualifying property or undergoes change in ownership within five year of it placed in service date the recapture amount decrease on each anniversary of the placed in service date since we have an obligation to ensure that the solar energy system is in service and operational for term of five year in order to avoid any recapture of the itc we recognize revenue the recapture amount decrease assuming the other revenue recognition criterion above have been met result the monetized itc is initially recorded deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet and subsequently one fifth of the monetized itc is recognized energy generation and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operation on each anniversary of the solar energy system placed in service date over five year discussed in the revenue recognition section above following the adoption of the new revenue standard on january we no longer defer the monetized itc deferred revenue outstanding and have reclassified all itc deferred revenue of december to our opening accumulated deficit we indemnify the investor for any recapture of itcs due to our non compliance we have concluded that the likelihood of recapture event is remote and consequently we have not recognized liability for this indemnification on the consolidated balance sheet nevada tax incentive we have entered into agreement with the state of nevada and storey county in nevada that provide abatement for sale use real property personal property and employer excise tax discount to the base tariff energy rate and transferable tax credit these incentive are available for the applicable period beginning on october and ending on either june or june depending on the incentive under these agreement we were eligible for maximum of million of transferable tax credit subject to capital investment by and our partner for gigafactory of at least billion which we exceeded during and specified hiring target for gigafactory which we exceeded during we record these credit earned when we have evidence there is market for their sale credit are applied cost offset to either employee expense or to capital asset depending on the source of the credit credit earned from employee hire or capital spending by our partner at gigafactory are recorded reduction to operating expense of december and we had earned million and million of transferable tax credit under these agreement respectively recent accounting pronouncement in may the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu no revenue from contract with customer to replace the existing revenue recognition criterion for contract with customer in august the fasb issued asu no deferral of the effective date to defer the effective date of asu no to interim and annual period beginning after december subsequently the fasb issued asu no principal versus agent consideration asu no identifying performance obligation and licensing asu no rescission of sec guidance because of accounting standard update and pursuant to staff announcement at the march eitf meeting asu no narrow scope improvement and practical expedient and asu no technical correction and improvement to clarify and amend the guidance in asu no we adopted the asus on january on modified retrospective basis through cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit the adoption of the asus changed the timing of revenue recognition to be at delivery for certain vehicle sale to customer or leasing partner with resale value guarantee which now qualify to be accounted for sale with right of return opposed to the prior accounting operating lease or collateralized lease borrowing upon adoption of the asus we recorded decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit of million including income tax effect which were immaterial refer to the revenue recognition section above for detail in february the fasb issued asu no lease to require lessee to recognize all lease with limited exception on the balance sheet while recognition on the statement of operation will remain similar to current lease accounting the asu also eliminates real estate specific provision and modifies certain aspect of lessor accounting subsequently the fasb issued asu no codification improvement to topic asu no targeted improvement and asu no narrow scope improvement for lessor to clarify and amend the guidance in asu no the asus are effective for interim and annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted we will adopt the asus on january on modified retrospective basis through cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated deficit balance prior comparative period will not be restated under this method and we will adopt all available practical expedient applicable further solar lease that commence on or after january where we are the lessor and which are currently accounted for lease will no longer meet the definition of lease instead solar lease commencing on or after january will be accounted for under asc in addition to recognizing operating lease that were previously not recognized on the consolidated balance sheet we also expect most of our build to suit lease to be de recognized with net decrease of approximately of million to our beginning accumulated deficit before income tax effect our build to suit lease will no longer qualify for build to suit accounting and will instead be recognized operating lease or finance lease upon adoption our consolidated balance sheet will include an overall reduction in asset in the range of approximately million to million and reduction in liability in the range of approximately million to million the asus are not expected to have material impact on the consolidated statement of operation or the consolidated statement of cash flow in june the fasb issued asu no measurement of credit loss on financial instrument to require

unit with it carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit an entity still ha the option to perform qualitative assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary the asu is effective for interim and annual period beginning after december with early adoption permitted adoption of the asu is prospective we have not yet selected an adoption date though the asu is currently not expected to have material impact on

research and development effort are not completed or are abandoned the ipr might be impaired the fair value of the ipr wa estimated using the replacement cost method under the cost approach based on the historical acquisition cost and expense of the technology adjusted for estimated developer profit opportunity cost and obsolescence factor during the year ended december we concluded that portion of the ipr wa not commercially feasible and consequently recognized an abandonment loss of million in restructuring and other expense in the consolidated statement of operation additionally million of ipr wa put into production during the year ended december and we expect to complete the remaining research and development effort in the first half of the nature of the research and development effort consists principally of planning designing and testing the technology for viability in manufacturing solar cell and module if commercial feasibility is not achieved for the remaining ipr we would likely look to other alternative technology the cost associated with one of the trade name acquired by ha been fully amortized of december we phased out the use of such trade name in our sale and

state that fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant such fair value is market based measurement that should be determined based on assumption that market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability the three tiered fair value hierarchy which prioritizes which input should be used in measuring fair value is comprised of level observable input such quoted price in active market level ii input other than quoted price in active market that are observable either directly or indirectly and level iii unobservable input for which there is little or no market data the fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair value our asset and liability that were measured at fair value on recurring basis were follows in thousand december december fair value level level ii level iii fair value level level ii level iii money market fund cash and cash equivalent restricted cash interest rate swap net total all of our money market fund were classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted price in active market our interest rate swap were classified within level ii of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using alternative

operational milestone are both achieved stock based compensation expense is recognized only when an operational milestone is considered probable of achievement regardless of much additional market capitalization must be achieved in order for tranche to vest at our current market capitalization even the first tranche of the ceo performance award will not vest unless our market capitalization

december current federal state foreign total current deferred federal state foreign total deferred total provision for income tax on december the tax cut and job act tax act wa enacted into law making significant change to the internal revenue code change include but are not limited to federal corporate tax rate decrease from to for tax year beginning after december the transition of international taxation from worldwide tax system to territorial system and one time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings we were required to recognize the effect of the tax law change in the period of enactment such re measuring our deferred tax asset and liability well reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax asset and liability the tax act did not give rise to any material impact on the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of operation due to our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax asset in december the security and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no income tax accounting implication of the tax cut and job act sab which allowed to record provisional amount during measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date such in accordance with sab we completed our analysis during the fourth quarter of considering current

investment in certain financing fund accrual and others total deferred tax asset valuation allowance deferred tax asset net of valuation allowance deferred tax liability depreciation and amortization other investment in certain financing fund total deferred tax liability deferred tax liability net of valuation allowance and deferred tax asset of december we recorded valuation allowance of billion for the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax decreased by million increased by million and increased by million during the year ended december and respectively the change in valuation allowance are primarily due to additional deferred tax asset and liability incurred in the respective year the additional deferred tax asset are net of re measurement from to result of the tax act there have been no material release of the valuation allowance management belief that based on the available information it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized such that full valuation allowance is required against all deferred tax asset we have net million of deferred tax asset in foreign jurisdiction which management belief are more likely than not to be fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdiction the reconciliation of tax at the federal statutory

bargain in purchase gain other reconciling item change in valuation allowance provision for income tax of january upon the adoption of asu no improvement to employee share based payment accounting excess tax benefit from share based award activity incurred from the prior and current year are reflected reduction of the provision for income tax the excess tax benefit result in an increase to our gross deferred tax asset that is offset by corresponding increase to our valuation allowance due to the tax act our deferred tax asset and liability of december were re measured from to the change in tax rate resulted in decrease to our gross deferred tax asset which is offset by corresponding decrease to our valuation allowance of december we had billion of federal and billion of state net operating loss carry forward available to offset future taxable income which will not begin to significantly expire until for federal and for state purpose portion of these loss were generated by solarcity prior to our acquisition in and therefore are subject to change of control provision which limit the amount of acquired tax attribute that can be utilized in given tax year we do not expect these change of control limitation to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attribute of december we had research and development tax credit of million and million for federal and state income tax purpose respectively if not utilized the federal research and development tax credit will expire in various amount beginning in however the state research and development tax credit can be carried forward indefinitely in addition we have other general business tax credit of million for federal income tax purpose which will not begin to significantly expire until collectively we had no foreign earnings of december and therefore wa not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax provision of the tax act however some of our foreign subsidiary do have accumulated earnings no deferred tax liability for foreign withholding tax have been recorded relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiary since all such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial federal and state law can impose substantial restriction on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry forward in the event of an ownership change defined in section of the internal revenue code we have determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry forward due to prior ownership change uncertain tax position the change to our gross unrecognized tax benefit were follows in thousand december increase in balance related to prior year tax position increase in balance related to current year tax position assumed uncertain tax position through acquisition december decrease in balance related to prior year tax position increase in balance related to current year tax position change in balance related to effect of tax law change december decrease in balance related to prior year tax position increase in balance related to current year tax position december of december accrued interest and penalty related to unrecognized tax benefit are classified income tax expense and were immaterial unrecognized tax benefit of million if recognized would not affect our effective tax rate since the tax benefit would increase deferred tax asset that is currently fully offset by full valuation allowance we file income tax return in the california and various state and foreign jurisdiction we are currently under examination by the irs for the year and additional tax year within the period to remain subject to examination for federal income tax purpose and tax year to remain subject to examination for california income tax purpose all net operating loss and tax credit generated to date are subject to adjustment for federal and california income tax purpose tax year to remain subject to examination in other state and foreign jurisdiction the potential outcome of the current examination could result in change to unrecognized tax benefit within the next twelve month however we can not reasonably estimate possible adjustment at this time the tax court issued decision in altera corp commissioner related to the treatment of stock based compensation expense in cost sharing arrangement this decision can be overturned upon appeal we have not recorded any impact of december in addition any potential tax benefit would increase our deferred tax asset which is currently offset with full valuation allowance note commitment and contingency non cancellable lease we have entered into various

exposure from this obligation based on all the information available at that time including any guideline issued by the treasury department on solar energy system valuation for purpose of claiming treasury grant and any audit undertaken by the irs we believe that any payment to the fund investor in excess of the amount already recognized by which were immaterial for this obligation are not probable based on the fact known at the filing date the maximum potential future payment that we could have to make under this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair value of the solar energy system sold or transferred to the fund determined by and the value that the treasury department would determine fair value for the system for purpose of claiming treasury grant or the value the irs would determine the fair value for the system for purpose of claiming itcs or treasury grant we claim treasury grant based on guideline provided by the treasury department and the statutory regulation from the irs we use fair value determined with the assistance of independent third party appraisal commissioned by the basis for determining the itcs that are passed through to and claimed by the fund investor since we can not determine future revision to treasury department guideline governing solar energy system value or how the irs will evaluate system value used in claiming itcs or treasury grant we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum potential future payment that it could have to make under this obligation of each balance sheet date we are eligible to receive certain state and local incentive that are associated with renewable energy generation the amount of incentive that can be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size
