operating result or our financial condition these risk factor include supply and demandthe oil gas and petrochemical business are fundamentally commodity business this mean exxonmobil operation and earnings may be significantly affected by change in oil gas and petrochemical price and by change in margin on refined product oil gas petrochemical and product price and margin in turn depend on local regional and global event or condition that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity or product any material decline in oil or natural gas price could have material adverse effect on

petrochemical is generally linked closely with broad based economic activity and level of prosperity the occurrence of recession or other period of low or negative economic growth will typically have direct adverse impact on our result other factor that affect general economic condition in the world or in major region such change in population growth rate period of civil unrest government

seasonal weather pattern increased competitiveness of or government policy support for alternative energy source change in technology that alter fuel choice such technological advance in energy storage that make wind and solar more competitive for power generation change in consumer preference for our product including consumer demand for alternative fueled or electric transportation or alternative to plastic product and broad based change in personal income level see also climate change and the energy transition below other supply related factor commodity price and margin also vary depending on number of factor affecting supply for example increased supply from the development of new oil and gas supply source and technology to enhance recovery from existing source tends to reduce commodity price to the extent such supply increase are not offset by commensurate growth in demand similarly increase in industry refining or petrochemical manufacturing capacity relative to demand tend to reduce margin on the affected product world oil gas and petrochemical supply level can also be affected by factor that reduce available supply such the level of and adherence by participating country to production quota established by opec or opec and other agreement among sovereign government policy including action intended to reduce greenhouse gas emission that restrict oil and gas production or increase associated cost and the occurrence of war hostile action natural disaster disruption in competitor operation logistics constraint or unexpected unavailability of distribution channel that may disrupt supply technological change can also alter the relative cost for competitor to find produce and refine oil and gas and to manufacture petrochemical other market factor exxonmobil business result are also exposed to potential negative impact due to change in interest rate inflation currency exchange rate and other local or regional market condition in addition to direct potential impact on our cost and revenue market factor such rate of inflation may indirectly impact our result to the extent such factor reduce general rate of economic growth and therefore

their oil and gas resource including by restricting leasing or permitting activity or may place resource off limit from development altogether restriction on production of oil and gas could increase to the extent government view such measure viable approach for pursuing national and global energy and climate policy restriction on foreign investment in the oil and gas sector tend to increase in time of high commodity price when national government may have le need for outside source of private capital many country also restrict the import or export of certain product based on point of origin restriction on business exxonmobil is subject to law and sanction imposed by the united state or by other jurisdiction where we business that may prohibit exxonmobil or it affiliate from doing business in certain country or restricting the kind of business that may be conducted such restriction may provide competitive advantage to competitor who may not be subject to comparable restriction lack of legal certainty country in which we do business lack well developed legal system or have not yet adopted or may be unable to maintain clear regulatory framework for oil and gas development lack of legal certainty expose our operation to increased risk of adverse or unpredictable action by government official and also make it more difficult for to enforce our contract in some case these risk can be partially offset by agreement to arbitrate dispute in an international forum but the adequacy of this remedy may still depend on the local legal system to enforce an award regulatory and litigation risk even in country with well developed legal system where exxonmobil doe business we remain exposed to change in law or interpretation of settled law including change that result from international treaty and accord and change in policy that could adversely affect our result such increase in tax duty or government royalty rate including retroactive claim price control change in environmental regulation or other law that increase our cost of compliance or reduce or delay available business opportunity including change in law affecting offshore drilling operation water use emission hydraulic fracturing or production or use of new or recycled plastic action by policy maker regulator or other actor to delay or deny necessary license and permit restrict the availability of oil and gas lease or the transportation of our product or otherwise require change in the company business or strategy that could result in reduced return adoption of regulation mandating efficiency standard the use of alternative fuel or uncompetitive fuel component adoption of government payment transparency regulation that could require to disclose competitively sensitive commercial information or that could cause to violate the non disclosure law of other country and government action to cancel contract redenominate the official currency renounce or default on obligation renegotiate term unilaterally or expropriate asset legal remedy available to compensate for expropriation or other taking may be inadequate we also may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation especially in country such the united state in which large and unpredictable punitive damage award may occur by government enforcement proceeding alleging non compliance with applicable law or regulation or by state and local government actor well private plaintiff acting in parallel that attempt to use the legal system to promote public policy agenda including seeking to reduce the production and sale of hydrocarbon product through litigation targeting the company or other industry participant gain political notoriety or obtain monetary award from the company the adoption of similar legal practice in the european union or elsewhere would broaden this risk and ha begun to be applied to some of our competitor in the european union security concern successful operation of particular facility or project may be disrupted by civil unrest act of sabotage or terrorism cybersecurity attack the application of national security law or policy that result in restricting our ability to do business in particular jurisdiction and other local security concern such concern may be directed specifically at our company our industry or part of broader movement and may require to incur greater cost for security or to shut operation for period of time climate change and the energy transition net zero scenario driven by concern over the risk of climate change number of country have adopted or are considering the adoption of regulatory framework to reduce greenhouse gas emission including emission from the production and use of oil and gas and their product these action are taken both independently by national and regional government and within the framework of united nation conference of the party summit under which many country of the world have endorsed objective to reduce the atmospheric concentration of over the coming decade with an ambition ultimately to achieve net zero net zero mean that emission of greenhouse gas from human activity would be balanced by action that remove such gas from the atmosphere expectation for transition of the world energy system to lower emission source and ultimately net zero derive from hypothetical scenario that reflect many assumption about the future and reflect substantial uncertainty the company objective to play leading role in the energy transition including the company announced ambition ultimately to achieve net zero with respect to scope and emission from operation where exxonmobil is the operator carry risk that the transition including underlying technology policy and market discussed in more detail below will not develop at the pace or in the manner expected by current net zero scenario the success of our strategy for the energy transition will also depend on our ability to recognize key signpost of change in the global energy system on timely basis and our corresponding ability to direct investment to the technology and business at the appropriate stage of development to best capitalize on our competitive strength greenhouse gas restriction government action intended to reduce greenhouse gas emission include adoption of cap and trade regime carbon tax carbon based import duty or other trade tariff minimum renewable usage requirement restrictive permitting increased mileage and other efficiency standard mandate for sale of electric vehicle mandate for use of specific fuel or technology and other incentive or mandate designed to support transitioning to lower emission energy source political and other actor and their agent also increasingly seek to advance climate change objective indirectly such by seeking to reduce the availability or increase the cost of financing and investment in the oil and gas sector and taking action intended to promote change in business strategy for oil and gas company depending on policy are formulated and applied such policy could negatively affect our investment return make our hydrocarbon based product more expensive or le competitive lengthen project implementation time and reduce demand for hydrocarbon well shift hydrocarbon demand toward relatively lower carbon alternative current and pending greenhouse gas regulation or policy may also increase our compliance cost such for monitoring or sequestering emission technology and lower emission solution achieving societal ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emission and ultimately achieve net zero will require new technology to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy source well technology such carbon capture and storage cc cc technology focused initially on capturing and sequestering emission from high intensity industrial activity can assist in meeting society objective to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas level also helping ensure the availability of the reliable and affordable energy the world requires exxonmobil ha established low carbon solution lcs business unit to advance the development and deployment of these technology and project including cc hydrogen and lower emission fuel breakthrough energy efficiency process advanced energy saving material and other technology the company effort include both in house research and development well collaborative effort with leading university and with commercial partner involved in advanced lower emission energy technology our future result and ability to grow our lcs business help nation meet their emission reduction goal and succeed through the energy transition will depend in part on the success of these research and collaboration effort and on our ability to adapt and apply the strength of our current business model to providing the energy product of the future in cost competitive manner policy and market development the scale of the world energy system mean that in addition to development in technology discussed successful energy transition will require appropriate support from government and private participant throughout the global economy our ability to develop and deploy cc and other lower emission energy technology at commercial scale and the growth and future return of lcs and other emerging business in which we invest will depend in part on the continued development of supportive government policy and market failure or delay of these policy or market to materialize or be maintained could adversely impact these investment policy and other action that result in restricting the availability of hydrocarbon product without commensurate reduction in demand may have unpredictable adverse effect including increased commodity price volatility period of significantly higher commodity price and resulting inflationary pressure and local or regional energy shortage such effect in turn may depress economic growth or lead to rapid or conflicting shift in policy by different actor with resulting adverse effect on our business in addition the existence of supportive policy in any jurisdiction is not guarantee that those policy will continue in the future see also the discussion of supply and demand government and political factor and operational and other factor in this item operational and other factorsin addition to external economic and political factor our future business result also depend on our ability to manage successfully those factor that are at least in part within our control the extent to which we manage these factor will impact our performance relative to competition for project in which we are not the operator we depend on the management effectiveness of one or more co venturer we do not control exploration and development program our ability to maintain and grow our oil and gas production depends on the success of our exploration and development effort among other factor we must continuously improve our ability to identify the most promising resource prospect and apply our project management expertise to bring discovered resource online scheduled and within budget project and portfolio management the long term success of exxonmobil upstream and product solution business well the future success of lcs and other emerging lower emission investment depends on complex long term capital intensive project these project in turn require high degree of project management expertise to maximize efficiency specific factor that can affect the performance of major project include our ability to negotiate successfully with joint venturer partner government supplier customer or others model and optimize reservoir performance develop market for project output whether through long term contract or the development of effective spot market manage change in operating condition and cost including cost of third party equipment or service such drilling rig and shipping supply chain disruption and inflationary cost pressure prevent to the extent possible and respond effectively to unforeseen technical difficulty that could delay project start or cause unscheduled project downtime and influence the performance of project operator where exxonmobil doe not perform that role in addition to the effective management of individual project exxonmobil success including our ability to mitigate risk and provide attractive return to shareholder depends on our ability to successfully manage our overall portfolio including diversification among type and location of our project product produced and strategy to divest asset we may not be able to divest asset at price or on the timeline we contemplate in our strategy additionally we may retain certain liability following divestment and could be held liable for past use or for different liability anticipated the term project used in this report can refer to variety of different activity and doe not necessarily have the meaning in any government payment transparency report operational efficiency an important component of exxonmobil competitive performance especially given the commodity based nature of many of our business is our ability to operate efficiently including our ability to manage expense and improve production yield on an ongoing basis this requires continuous management focus including technology improvement cost control productivity enhancement regular reappraisal of our asset portfolio and the recruitment development and retention of high caliber employee research and development and technological change to maintain our competitive position especially in light of the technological nature of our business and the need for continuous efficiency improvement exxonmobil technology research and development organization must be successful and able to adapt to changing market and policy environment including developing technology to help reduce greenhouse gas emission to remain competitive we must also continuously adapt and capture the benefit of new and emerging technology including successfully applying advance in the ability to process very large amount of data to our business safety business control and environmental risk management our result depend on management ability to minimize the inherent risk of oil gas and petrochemical operation to effectively control our business activity and to minimize the potential for human error we apply rigorous management system and continuous focus on workplace safety and avoiding spill or other adverse environmental event for example we work to minimize spill through combined program of effective operation integrity management ongoing upgrade key equipment replacement and comprehensive inspection and surveillance similarly we are implementing cost effective new technology and adopting new operating practice to reduce emission not only in response to government requirement but also to address community priority we employ comprehensive enterprise risk management system to identify and manage risk across our business we also maintain disciplined framework of internal control and apply control management system for monitoring compliance with this framework substantial liability and other adverse impact could result if we do not timely identify and mitigate applicable risk or if our management system and control do not function intended cybersecurity exxonmobil is regularly subject to attempted cybersecurity disruption from variety of source including state sponsored actor exxonmobil defensive preparedness includes multi layered technological capability for prevention and detection of cybersecurity disruption non technological measure such threat information sharing with governmental and industry group annual internal training and awareness campaign including routine testing of employee awareness and an emphasis on resiliency including business response and recovery if the measure we are taking to protect cybersecurity disruption prove to be insufficient or if our proprietary data is otherwise not protected exxonmobil well our customer employee or third party could be adversely affected we are also exposed to potential harm from cybersecurity event that may affect the operation of third party including our partner supplier service provider including provider of cloud hosting service for our data or application and customer cybersecurity disruption could cause physical harm to people or the environment damage or destroy asset compromise business system result in proprietary information being altered lost or stolen result in employee customer or third party information being compromised or otherwise disrupt our business operation we could incur significant cost to remedy the effect of major cybersecurity disruption in addition to cost in connection with resulting regulatory action litigation or reputational harm preparedness our operation may be disrupted by severe weather event natural disaster human error and similar event for example hurricane may damage our offshore production facility or coastal refining and petrochemical plant in vulnerable area our facility are designed engineered constructed and operated to withstand variety of extreme climatic and other condition with safety factor built in to cover number of uncertainty including those associated with wave wind and current intensity marine ice flow pattern permafrost stability storm surge magnitude temperature extreme extreme rainfall event and earthquake our consideration of changing weather condition and inclusion of safety factor in design cover the engineering uncertainty that climate change and other event may potentially introduce our ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these event depends in part upon the effectiveness of our robust facility engineering our rigorous disaster preparedness and response and business continuity planning insurance limitation the ability of the corporation to insure against many of the risk it face described in this item is limited by the availability and cost of coverage which may not be economic well the capacity of the applicable insurance market which may not be sufficient competition noted in item above the energy and petrochemical industry are highly competitive we face competition not only from other private firm but also from state owned company that are increasingly competing for opportunity outside of their home country and partner with other private firm in some case these state owned company may pursue opportunity in furtherance of strategic objective of their government owner with le focus on financial return than company owned by private shareholder such exxonmobil technology and expertise provided by industry service company may also enhance the competitiveness of firm that may not have the internal resource and capability of exxonmobil or reduce the need for resource owning country to partner with private sector oil and gas company in order to monetize national resource described in more detail above our hydrocarbon based energy product are also subject to growing and in many case government supported competition from alternative energy source reputation our reputation is an important corporate asset factor that could have negative impact on our reputation include an operating incident or significant cybersecurity disruption change in consumer view concerning our product perception by investor or others that the corporation is making insufficient progress with respect to our ambition to play leading role in the energy transition or that pursuit of this ambition may result in allocation of capital to investment with reduced return and other adverse event such those described in this item negative impact on our reputation could in turn make it more difficult for to compete successfully for new opportunity obtain necessary regulatory approval obtain financing and attract talent or they could reduce consumer demand for our branded product exxonmobil reputation may also be harmed by event which negatively affect the image of our industry whole projection estimate and description of exxonmobil plan and objective included or incorporated in item and of this report are forward looking statement actual future result including project completion date

weather event price effect on production sharing contract change in the amount and timing of capital investment that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment international trade pattern and relation and other factor described in item risk factor the estimation of proved reserve which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluation commercial and market assessment and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such flow rate and reservoir pressure furthermore the corporation only record proved reserve for project which have received significant funding commitment by management toward the development of the reserve although the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserve will be produced the timing and amount recovered can be affected by number of factor including completion of development project reservoir performance regulatory approval government policy consumer preference and significant change in crude oil and natural gas price level in addition proved reserve could be affected by an extended period of low price which could reduce the level of the corporation capital spending and also impact our partner capacity to fund their share of joint project technology used in establishing proved reserve addition in to exxonmobil proved reserve in were based on estimate generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological engineering and production data utilizing well established technology that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent result data used in these integrated assessment included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores such well log reservoir core sample fluid sample static and dynamic pressure information production test data and surveillance and performance information the data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurement including high quality and seismic data calibrated with available well control information the tool used to interpret the data included seismic processing software reservoir modeling and simulation software and data analysis package in some circumstance where appropriate analog reservoir were available reservoir parameter from these analog were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserve estimate qualification of reserve technical oversight group and internal control over proved reservesexxonmobil ha dedicated global reserve and resource group that provides technical oversight and is separate from the operating organization primary responsibility of this group include oversight of the reserve estimation process for compliance with security and exchange commission sec rule and regulation review of annual change in reserve estimate and the reporting of exxonmobil proved reserve this group also maintains the official company reserve estimate for exxonmobil proved reserve of crude oil natural gas liquid bitumen synthetic oil and natural gas in addition the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting process within exxonmobil and it affiliate the global reserve and resource manager ha more than year of experience in reservoir engineering and reserve assessment ha degree in engineering and served on the oil and gas reserve committee of the society of petroleum engineer spe the group is staffed with individual that have an average of more than year of technical experience in the petroleum industry including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserve under sec guideline this group includes individual who hold degree in either engineering or geology the global reserve and resource group maintains central database containing the official company reserve estimate appropriate control including limitation on database access and update capability are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database an annual review of the system control is performed by internal audit key component of the reserve estimation process include technical evaluation commercial and market assessment analysis of well and field performance and long standing approval guideline no change may be made to the reserve estimate in the central database including addition of any new initial reserve estimate or subsequent revision unless these change have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professional within the operating organization in addition change to reserve estimate that exceed certain threshold require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization the change may be made in the central database endorsement by the global reserve and resource group for all proved reserve change is mandatory component of this review process after all change are made review are held with senior management for final endorsement proved undeveloped reservesat year end approximately billion oil equivalent barrel goeb of exxonmobil proved reserve were classified proved undeveloped this represents percent of the goeb reported in proved reserve this compare to goeb of proved undeveloped reserve reported at the end of during the year exxonmobil conducted development activity that resulted in the transfer of approximately goeb from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserve by year end the largest transfer were related to development activity in the united state mozambique guyana and the united arab emirate during extension and discovery primarily in the united state and guyana resulted in the addition of approximately goeb of proved undeveloped reserve along with an increase of approximately goeb due to purchase in asia also the corporation reclassified approximately goeb of proved undeveloped reserve which no longer met the sec definition of proved reserve primarily in the united state and canada overall investment of billion were made by the corporation during to progress the development of reported proved undeveloped reserve including billion for oil and gas producing activity along with additional investment for other non oil and gas producing activity such the construction of support infrastructure and other related facility these investment represented percent of the billion in total reported upstream capital and exploration expenditure one of exxonmobil requirement for reporting proved reserve is that management ha made significant funding commitment toward the development of the reserve exxonmobil ha disciplined investment strategy and many major field require long lead time in order to be developed development project typically take several year from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserve to the start of production and can exceed five year for large and complex project proved undeveloped reserve in australia kazakhstan the united state and the united arab emirate have remained undeveloped for five year or more primarily due to constraint on the capacity of infrastructure well the time required to complete development for very large project the corporation is reasonably certain that these proved reserve will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by number of factor including completion of development project reservoir performance regulatory approval government policy consumer preference the pace of co venturer government funding change in the amount and timing of capital investment and significant change in crude oil and natural gas price level of the proved undeveloped reserve that have been reported for five or more year over percent are contained

scenario we strive to play leading role in the energy transition bringing to bear these same advantage while retaining investment flexibility across portfolio of evolving opportunity to grow shareholder value with advance in technology and the support of clear and consistent government policy we aim to achieve net zero operated scope and greenhouse gas emission by to this end we have taken comprehensive approach to create greenhouse gas emission reduction roadmaps for our major operated asset the roadmaps build on the company emission reduction plan and notably include reaching net zero emission scope and in our unconventional permian basin operated asset by we completed these roadmaps in many of the required reduction step are unaffordable with today technology and policy support we plan to update the roadmaps needed to reflect technology policy and other necessary development including the development and acquisition of major operated asset compared to level our emission reduction plan include percent reduction in corporate wide greenhouse gas intensity percent reduction in upstream greenhouse gas intensity percent reduction in company wide methane intensity and percent reduction in corporate wide hydrocarbon flaring intensity in achieving these objective we also expect to see absolute reduction in corporate wide greenhouse gas emission by approximately percent upstream greenhouse gas emission of approximately percent corporate wide hydrocarbon flaring of approximately percent corporate wide methane emission by approximately percent and world bank zero routine flaring by these emission reduction plan cover scope and emission from asset we operate since formally launching exxonmobil low carbon solution business in early the corporation ha significantly grown the pipeline of emission reduction opportunity in carbon capture and storage hydrogen and lower emission fuel low carbon solution leverage the corporation unique combination of existing asset technical capability project management skill and broad relationship with industry and government to accelerate emission reduction for customer and help to reduce emission in our existing business the corporation plan to invest in initiative to lower greenhouse gas emission these investment are designed to reduce emission in the company operation and are also directed toward reducing others emission through commercializing and scaling carbon capture and storage hydrogen and lower emission fuel policy support along with technology advancement are important to the development and deployment of lower emission technology necessary for net zero future recent business environment prior to the covid pandemic many company in the industry invested below the level needed to maintain or increase production capacity to meet anticipated demand during the covid pandemic this decline in investment accelerated industry revenue collapsed resulting in underinvestment and supply tightness demand for petroleum and petrochemical product recovered in addition industry rationalization of refining asset resulted in more than million barrel per day of capacity being taken offline across late and the first half of these reduction along with supply chain constraint and continuation of demand recovery led to steady increase in oil and natural gas price and refining margin demand for petroleum and petrochemical product grew in with the corporation financial result benefiting from stronger price and margin notably for crude oil and natural gas well refining product the rate and pace of recovery however ha varied across geography and business line with industry chemical margin falling below the bottom of the year range late in reflecting weakening global demand and capacity addition commodity and product price are expected to remain volatile given the current global economic uncertainty and geopolitical event affecting supply and demand the general rate of inflation across major country experienced brief decline in the initial stage of the covid pandemic before starting to increase steadily in due to an imbalance in supply and demand the underlying factor include but are not limited to time cycle of capacity investment supply chain disruption shipping bottleneck labor constraint and side effect from monetary and fiscal expansion

benchmark price for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicator of change in the earnings experienced in any particular period in the very competitive petroleum and petrochemical environment earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price level of product sold refining margin are function of the difference between what refiner pay for it raw material primarily crude oil and the market price for the range of product produced these price in turn depend on global and regional supply demand balance inventory level refinery operation import export balance and weather the global energy market can give rise to extended period in which market condition are adverse to one or more of the corporation business such condition along with the

intersegment sale are at market based price the product bought and sold between segment can also be acquired in worldwide market that have substantial liquidity capacity and transportation capability refer to note for additional information on intersegment revenue although price level of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global economic condition political event decision by opec and other major government resource owner and other factor industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand the corporation evaluates investment over range of price including estimated greenhouse gas emission cost even in jurisdiction without current greenhouse gas pricing policy the corporation ha an active asset management program in which nonstrategic asset are considered for divestment the asset management program includes disciplined regular review to ensure that asset are contributing to the corporation strategic objective risk managementthe corporation size strong capital structure geographic diversity and the complementary nature of it business segment reduce the corporation enterprise wide risk from change in commodity price currency rate and interest rate in addition the corporation us commodity based contract including derivative to manage commodity price risk and to generate return from trading the corporation commodity derivative are not accounted for under hedge accounting at time the corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivative none of which are material to the corporation financial position of december and or result of operation for the year ended and credit risk associated with the corporation derivative position is mitigated by several factor including the use of derivative clearing exchange and the quality of and financial limit placed on derivative counterparties no material market or credit risk to the corporation financial position result of operation or liquidity exist result of the derivative described in note the corporation maintains system of control that includes the authorization reporting and monitoring of derivative activity the corporation is exposed to change in interest rate primarily on it short term debt and the portion of long term debt that carry floating interest rate the impact of basis point change in interest rate affecting the corporation debt would not be material to earnings or cash flow the corporation ha access to significant capacity of long term and short term liquidity internally

joint venture partner are dependent on the credit market and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint venture project the corporation conduct business in many foreign currency and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flow related to sale expense financing and investment transaction fluctuation in exchange rate are often offsetting and the impact on exxonmobil geographically and functionally diverse operation are varied the corporation make limited use of currency exchange contract to mitigate the impact of change in currency value and exposure related to

financial reporting fairly reflect it integrated business model involving exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas manufacture trade transport and sale of crude oil natural gas petroleum product petrochemical and wide variety of specialty product and pursuit of lower emission business opportunity including carbon capture and storage hydrogen and lower emission fuel the preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires management to make estimate and judgment that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue and expense and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability the corporation accounting policy are summarized in note oil and natural gas reservesthe estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volume is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluation commercial and market assessment and detailed analysis of well information such flow rate and reservoir pressure decline development and production cost and other factor the estimation of proved reserve is controlled by the corporation through long standing approval guideline reserve change are made within well established disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professional assisted by the global reserve and resource group which ha significant technical experience culminating in review with and approval by senior management notably the corporation doe not use specific quantitative reserve target to determine compensation key feature of the reserve estimation process are covered in disclosure of reserve in item oil and natural gas reserve include both proved and unproved reserve proved oil and natural gas reserve are determined in accordance with security and exchange commission sec requirement proved reserve are those quantity of oil and natural gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible under existing economic and operating condition and government regulation proved reserve are determined using the average of first of month oil and natural gas price during the reporting year proved reserve can be further subdivided into developed and undeveloped reserve proved developed reserve include amount which are expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method proved undeveloped reserve include amount expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled proved acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for completion proved undeveloped reserve are recognized only if development plan ha been adopted indicating that the reserve are scheduled to be drilled within five year unless specific circumstance support longer period of time the corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserve will be produced however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by number of factor including completion of development project reservoir performance regulatory approval government policy consumer preference and significant change in oil and natural gas price level unproved reserve are quantity of oil and natural gas with le than reasonable certainty of recoverability and include probable reserve probable reserve are reserve that together with proved reserve are likely not to be recovered revision in previously estimated volume of proved reserve for existing field can occur due to the evaluation or evaluation of already available geologic reservoir or production data new geologic reservoir or production data or change in the average of first of month oil and natural gas price and or cost that are used in the estimation of reserve revision can also result from significant change in development strategy or production equipment and facility capacity unit of production depreciation oil and natural gas reserve volume are used the basis to calculate unit of production depreciation rate for most upstream asset depreciation is calculated by taking the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserve or proved developed reserve applied to actual production the volume produced and asset cost are known while proved reserve are based on estimate that are subject to some variability in the event that the unit of production method doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset an alternative method is used the straight line method is used in limited situation where the expected life of the asset doe not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserve for example certain asset used in the production of oil and natural gas have shorter life than the reserve and such the corporation us straight line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of it useful life to the extent that proved reserve for property are substantially de booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life asset will be depreciated using unit of production method based on reserve determined at the most recent sec price which result in more meaningful quantity of proved reserve appropriately adjusted for production and technical change management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsimpairment the corporation test asset or group of asset for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable the corporation ha robust process to monitor for indicator of potential impairment across it asset group throughout the year this process is aligned with the requirement of asc and asc and relies in part on the corporation planning and budgeting cycle because the lifespan of the vast majority of the corporation major asset are measured in decade the future cash flow of these asset are predominantly based on long term oil and natural gas commodity price and industry margin development cost and production cost significant reduction in the corporation view of oil or natural gas commodity price or margin range especially the longer term price and margin and change in the development plan including decision to defer reduce or eliminate planned capital spending can be an indicator of potential impairment other event or change in circumstance including indicator outlined in asc can be indicator of potential impairment well in general the corporation doe not view temporarily low price or margin an indication of impairment management belief that price over the long term must be sufficient to generate investment in energy supply to meet global demand although price will occasionally drop significantly industry price over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamental on the supply side industry production from mature field is declining this is being offset by investment to generate production from new discovery field development and technology and efficiency advancement opec investment activity and production policy also have an impact on world oil supply the demand side is largely function of general economic activity alternative energy source and level of prosperity during the lifespan of it major asset the corporation expects that oil and gas price and industry margin will experience significant volatility consequently these asset will experience period of higher earnings and period of lower earnings or even loss in assessing whether event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation considers recent period of operating loss in the context of it longer term view of price and margin outlook for energy and cash flow assessment the annual planning and budgeting process known the corporate plan is the mechanism by which resource capital operating expense and people are allocated across the corporation the foundation for the assumption supporting the corporate plan is the outlook for energy outlook which contains the corporation demand and supply projection based on it assessment of current trend in technology government policy consumer preference geopolitics economic development and other factor reflective of the existing global policy environment the outlook doe not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world or the corporation to meet net zero by future policy and technology advancement emerge they will be incorporated into the outlook and the corporation business plan will be updated accordingly if event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation estimate the future undiscounted cash flow of the affected property to judge the recoverability of carrying amount in performing this assessment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset cash flow used in recoverability assessment are based on the assumption developed in the corporate plan which is reviewed and approved by the board of director and are consistent with the criterion management us to evaluate investment opportunity these evaluation make use of the corporation assumption of future capital allocation crude oil and natural gas commodity price including price differential refining and chemical margin volume development and operating cost including greenhouse gas emission price and foreign currency exchange rate notably when assessing future cash flow the corporation includes the estimated cost in support of reaching it greenhouse gas emission reduction plan including it goal of net zero greenhouse gas emission scope and from unconventional operated asset in the permian basin volume are based on projected field and facility production profile throughput or sale management estimate of upstream production volume used for projected cash flow make use of proved reserve quantity and may include risk adjusted unproved reserve quantity exxonmobil considers range of scenario including remote scenario to help inform perspective of the future and enhance strategic thinking over time while third party scenario such the international energy agency net zero emission by may be used for these purpose they are not used basis for developing future cash flow for impairment assessment part of the corporate plan the company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission cost even for jurisdiction without current greenhouse gas pricing policy fair value of impaired asset an asset group is impaired if it estimated undiscounted cash flow are le than the asset group carrying value impairment are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value the assessment of fair value is based upon the view of likely market participant the principal parameter used to establish fair value include estimate of acreage value and flowing production metric from comparable market transaction market based estimate of historical cash flow multiple and discounted cash flow input and assumption used in discounted cash flow model include estimate of future production volume throughput and product sale volume commodity price which are consistent with the average of third party industry expert and government agency refining and chemical margin drilling and development cost operating cost and discount rate which are reflective of the characteristic of the asset group management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsother impairment estimate unproved property are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired significant unproved property are assessed for impairment individually and valuation allowance against the capitalized cost are recorded based on the corporation future development plan the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the property property that are not individually significant are aggregated by group and amortized based on development risk and average holding period long lived asset that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with it fair value le the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value le cost to sell the asset are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value judgment is required to determine if asset are held for sale and to determine the fair value le cost to sell investment accounted for by the equity method are assessed for possible impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable example of key indicator include history of operating loss negative earnings and cash flow outlook significant downward revision to oil and gas reserve and the financial condition and prospect for the investee business segment or geographic region if the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value in the absence of market price for the investment discounted cash flow are used to ass fair value which requires significant judgment recent impairment in early in response to russia military action in ukraine the corporation announced that it planned to discontinue operation on the sakhalin project sakhalin and develop step to exit the venture the corporation first quarter result included after tax charge of billion representing the impairment of it upstream operation related to sakhalin refer to note for further information on russia other after tax impairment charge of billion and billion were recognized in upstream and energy product respectively in largely result of change to upstream development plan the corporation recognized after tax impairment charge of approximately billion in part of the corporation annual review and approval of it business and strategic plan decision wa made to no longer develop significant portion of the dry gas portfolio in the united state canada and argentina the impairment of these asset resulted in after tax charge of billion in upstream other after tax impairment charge of billion across the year related mainly to impairment of property plant and equipment goodwill and equity method investment factor which could put further asset at risk of impairment in the future include reduction in the corporation price or margin outlook change in the allocation of capital or development plan reduced long term demand for the corporation product and operating cost increase which exceed the pace of efficiency or the pace of oil and natural gas price or margin increase however due to the inherent difficulty in predicting future commodity price or margin and the relationship between industry price and cost it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the existence or range of any potential future impairment charge related to the corporation long lived asset for further information regarding impairment in goodwill equity method investment property plant and equipment and suspended well refer to note and respectively asset retirement obligationsthe corporation is subject to retirement obligation for certain asset the fair value of these obligation are recorded liability on discounted basis which is typically at the time the asset are installed in the estimation of fair value the corporation us assumption and judgment regarding such factor the existence of legal obligation for an asset retirement obligation technical assessment of the asset estimated amount and timing of settlement discount rate and inflation rate see note for further information regarding asset retirement obligation suspended exploratory well coststhe corporation continues capitalization of exploratory well cost when it ha found sufficient quantity of reserve to justify completion producing well and the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project exploratory well cost not meeting these criterion are charged to expense assessing whether the corporation is making sufficient progress on project requires careful consideration of the fact and circumstance the fact and circumstance that support continued capitalization of suspended well at year end are disclosed in note management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationspension benefitsthe corporation and it affiliate sponsor defined benefit pension plan in country the pension and other postretirement benefit footnote note provides detail on pension obligation fund asset and pension expense some of these plan primarily non provide pension benefit that are paid directly by their sponsoring affiliate out of corporate cash flow rather than separate pension fund because applicable tax rule and regulatory practice do not encourage advance funding book reserve are established for these plan the portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed service are rendered the portion attributable to the increase in pension obligation due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligation which end when all benefit are paid the primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plan is that pension expense for funded plan also includes credit for the expected long term return on fund asset for funded plan including those in the pension obligation are financed in advance through segregated asset or insurance arrangement these plan are managed in compliance with the requirement of governmental authority and meet or exceed required funding level measured by relevant actuarial and government standard at the mandated measurement date in determining liability and required contribution these standard often require approach and assumption that differ from those used for accounting purpose the corporation will continue to make contribution to these funded plan necessary all defined benefit pension obligation regardless of the funding status of the underlying plan are fully supported by the financial strength of the corporation or the respective sponsoring affiliate pension accounting requires explicit assumption regarding among others the long term expected earnings rate on fund asset the discount rate for the benefit obligation and the long term rate for future salary increase pension assumption are reviewed annually by outside actuary and senior management these assumption are adjusted appropriate to reflect change in market rate and outlook the long term expected earnings rate on pension plan asset in wa percent the year and year actual return on pension plan asset were percent and percent respectively the corporation establishes the long term expected rate of return by developing forward looking long term return assumption for each pension fund asset class taking into account factor such the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation single long term rate of return is then calculated the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentage and the long term return assumption for each asset class worldwide reduction of percent in the long term rate of return on asset would increase annual pension expense by approximately million before tax difference between actual return on fund asset and the long term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs such difference are deferred along with other actuarial gain and loss and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employee litigation and tax contingenciesa variety of claim have been made against the corporation and certain of it consolidated subsidiary in number of pending lawsuit the corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingency where the incurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated for contingency where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and significant the corporation discloses the nature of the contingency and where feasible an estimate of the possible loss management ha regular litigation review including update from corporate and outside counsel to ass the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingency the status of significant claim is summarized in note management judgment is required related to contingent liability and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict however the corporation ha been successful in defending litigation in the past payment have not had material adverse effect on our operation or financial condition in the corporation experience large claim often do not result in large award large award are often reversed or substantially reduced result of appeal or settlement the corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdiction around the world the benefit of uncertain tax position that the corporation ha taken or expects to take in it income tax return are recognized in the financial statement if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authority for position that is likely to be sustained the benefit recognized in the financial statement is measured at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingency and tax dispute because the outcome are often difficult to predict the corporation unrecognized tax benefit and description of open tax year are summarized in note management

liability revenue and expense and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability actual result could differ from these estimate prior year data have been reclassified in certain case to conform to the presentation basis summary of accounting policiesprinciples of consolidation and accounting for investmentsthe consolidated financial statement include the account of subsidiary the corporation control and any variable interest entity where it is deemed the primary beneficiary they also include the corporation share of the undivided interest in certain upstream asset liability revenue and expense amount representing the corporation interest in entity that it doe not control but over which it exercise significant influence are included in investment advance and long term receivables under the equity method of accounting the corporation recognizes it share of the net income of these company in income from equity affiliate majority ownership is normally the indicator of control that is the basis on which subsidiary are consolidated however certain factor may indicate that majority owned investment is not controlled and therefore should be accounted for using the equity method of accounting these factor occur where the minority shareholder are granted by law or by contract substantive participating right these include the right to approve operating policy expense budget financing and investment plan and management compensation and succession plan investment accounted for by the equity method are assessed for possible impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable example of key indicator include history of operating loss negative earnings and cash flow outlook significant downward revision to oil and gas reserve and the financial condition and prospect for the investee business segment or geographic region if the decline in value of the investment is other than temporary the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value in the absence of market price for the investment discounted cash flow are used to ass fair value the corporation share of the cumulative foreign exchange translation adjustment for equity method investment is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income investment in equity security other than consolidated subsidiary and equity method investment are measured at fair value with change in fair value recognized in net income the corporation us the modified approach for equity security that do not have readily determinable fair value this modified approach measure investment at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus change resulting from observable price change in orderly transaction in similar investment of the same issuer revenue recognitionthe corporation generally sell crude oil natural gas and petroleum and chemical product under short term agreement at prevailing market price in some case natural gas product may be sold under long term agreement with periodic price adjustment to reflect market condition revenue is recognized at the amount the corporation expects to receive when the customer ha taken control which is typically when title transfer and the customer ha assumed the risk and reward of ownership the price of certain sale are based on price index that are sometimes not available until the next period in such case estimated realization are accrued when the sale is recognized and are finalized when the price is available such adjustment to revenue from performance obligation satisfied in previous period are not significant payment for revenue transaction is typically due within day future volume delivery obligation that are unsatisfied at the end of the period are expected to be fulfilled through ordinary production or purchase these performance obligation are based on market price at the time of the transaction and are fully constrained due to market price volatility purchase and sale of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another are combined and recorded exchange measured at the book value of the item sold sale and other operating revenue and note and account receivable include revenue and receivables both within the scope of asc revenue from contract with customer and those outside the scope of asc long term receivables are primarily from receivables outside the scope of asc contract asset are mainly from marketing assistance program and are not significant contract liability are mainly customer prepayment and accrual of expected volume discount and are not significant note to consolidated financial statementsincome and other taxesthe corporation excludes from the consolidated statement of income certain sale and value added tax imposed on and concurrent with revenue producing transaction with customer and collected on behalf of governmental authority similar tax for which the corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government are reported on gross basis included in both sale and other operating revenue and other tax and duty the corporation account for tax on global intangible low taxed income an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred derivative instrumentsthe corporation may use derivative instrument for trading purpose and to offset exposure associated with commodity price foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate that arise from existing asset liability firm commitment and forecasted transaction all derivative instrument except those designated normal purchase and normal sale are recorded at fair value derivative asset and liability with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criterion are met collateral payable or receivables are netted against derivative asset and derivative liability respectively recognition and classification of the gain or loss that result from adjusting derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative all gain and loss from derivative instrument for which the corporation doe not apply hedge accounting are immediately recognized in earnings the corporation may designate derivative fair value or cash flow hedge for fair value hedge the gain or loss from derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings for cash flow hedge the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affect earnings fair valuefair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant hierarchy level and are term for the priority of input to valuation technique used to measure fair value hierarchy level input are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability hierarchy level input are input other than quoted price included within level that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability hierarchy level input are input that are not observable in the market inventoriescrude oil product and merchandise inventory are carried at the lower of current market value or cost generally determined under the last in first out method lifo inventory cost include expenditure and other charge including depreciation directly and indirectly incurred in bringing the inventory to it existing condition and location selling expense and general and administrative expense are reported period cost and excluded from inventory cost inventory of material and supply are valued at cost or le property plant and equipmentcost basis the corporation us the successful effort method to account for it exploration and production activity under this method cost are accumulated on field by field basis cost incurred to purchase lease or otherwise acquire property whether unproved or proved are capitalized when incurred exploratory well cost are carried an asset when the well ha found sufficient quantity of reserve to justify it completion producing well and where the corporation is making sufficient progress assessing the reserve and the economic and operating viability of the project exploratory well cost not meeting these criterion are charged to expense other exploratory expenditure including geophysical cost and annual lease rental are expensed incurred development cost including cost of productive well and development dry hole are capitalized interest cost incurred to finance expenditure during the construction phase of multiyear project are capitalized part of the historical cost of acquiring the constructed asset the project construction phase commences with the development of the detailed engineering design and end when the constructed asset are ready for their intended use capitalized interest cost are included in property plant and equipment and are depreciated over the service life of the related asset note to consolidated financial statementsdepreciation depletion and amortization depreciation depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit of production method or the straight line method which is based on estimated asset service life taking obsolescence into consideration acquisition cost of proved property are amortized using unit of production method computed on the basis of total proved oil and natural gas reserve volume capitalized exploratory drilling and development cost associated with productive depletable extractive property are amortized using the unit of production rate based on the amount of proved developed reserve of oil and gas that are estimated to be recoverable from existing facility using current operating method under the unit of production method oil and natural gas volume are considered produced once they have been measured through meter at custody transfer or sale transaction point at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank in the event that the unit of production method doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the economic life of an upstream asset an alternative method is used the straight line method is used in limited situation where the expected life of the asset doe not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserve for example certain asset used in the production of oil and natural gas have shorter life than the reserve and such the corporation us straight line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of it useful life to the extent that proved reserve for property are substantially de booked and that property continues to produce such that the resulting depreciation charge doe not result in an equitable allocation of cost over the expected life asset will be depreciated using unit of production method based on reserve determined at the most recent sec price which result in more meaningful quantity of proved reserve appropriately adjusted for production and technical change investment in refinery chemical process and lube basestock manufacturing equipment are generally depreciated on straight line basis over year life service station building and fixed improvement are generally depreciated over year life maintenance and repair including planned major maintenance are expensed incurred major renewal and improvement are capitalized and the asset replaced are retired impairment assessment the corporation test asset or group of asset for recoverability on an ongoing basis whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among the event or change in circumstance which could indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable are the following significant decrease in the market price of long lived asset significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in it physical condition including significant decrease in current and projected reserve volume significant adverse change in legal factor or in the business climate that could affect the value including an adverse action or assessment by regulator an accumulation of project cost significantly in excess of the amount originally expected current period operating loss combined with history and forecast of operating or cash flow loss and current expectation that more likely than not long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life the corporation ha robust process to monitor for indicator of potential impairment across it asset group throughout the year this process is aligned with the requirement of asc and asc and relies in part on the corporation planning and budgeting cycle asset valuation analysis profitability review and other periodic control process assist the corporation in assessing whether event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of any of it asset may not be recoverable because the lifespan of the vast majority of the corporation major asset are measured in decade the future cash flow of these asset are predominantly based on long term oil and natural gas commodity price and industry margin development cost and production cost significant reduction in the corporation view of oil or natural gas commodity price or margin range especially the longer term price and margin and change in the development plan including decision to defer reduce or eliminate planned capital spending can be an indicator of potential impairment other event or change in circumstance can be indicator of potential impairment well note to consolidated financial statementsin general the corporation doe not view temporarily low price or margin an indication of impairment management belief that price over the long term must be sufficient to generate investment in energy supply to meet global demand although price will occasionally drop significantly industry price over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand fundamental on the supply side industry production from mature field is declining this is being offset by investment to generate production from new discovery field development and technology and efficiency advancement opec investment activity and production policy also have an impact on world oil supply the demand side is largely function of general economic activity alternative energy source and level of prosperity during the lifespan of it major asset the corporation expects that oil and gas price and industry margin will experience significant volatility consequently these asset will experience period of higher earnings and period of lower earnings or even loss in assessing whether event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation considers recent period of operating loss in the context of it longer term view of price and margin in the upstream the standardized measure of discounted cash flow included in the supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activity is required to use price based on the average of first of month price in the year these price represent discrete point in time and could be higher or lower than the corporation price assumption which are used for impairment assessment the corporation belief the standardized measure doe not provide reliable estimate of the expected future cash flow to be obtained from the development and production of it oil and gas property or of the value of it oil and gas reserve and therefore doe not consider it relevant in determining whether event or change in circumstance indicate the need for an impairment assessment outlook for energy and cash flow assessment the annual planning and budgeting process known the corporate plan is the mechanism by which resource capital operating expense and people are allocated across the corporation the foundation for the assumption supporting the corporate plan is the outlook for energy outlook which contains the corporation demand and supply projection based on it assessment of current trend in technology government policy consumer preference geopolitics economic development and other factor reflective of the existing global policy environment the outlook doe not attempt to project the degree of necessary future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world or the corporation to meet net zero by future policy and technology advancement emerge they will be incorporated into the outlook and the corporation business plan will be updated accordingly if event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable the corporation estimate the future undiscounted cash flow of the affected property to judge the recoverability of carrying amount in performing this assessment asset are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flow that are largely independent of the cash flow of other group of asset cash flow used in recoverability assessment are based on the assumption developed in the corporate plan which is reviewed and approved by the board of director and are consistent with the criterion management us to evaluate investment opportunity these evaluation make use of the corporation assumption of future capital allocation crude oil and natural gas commodity price including price differential refining and chemical margin volume development and operating cost including greenhouse gas emission price and foreign currency exchange rate notably when assessing future cash flow the corporation includes the estimated cost in support of reaching it greenhouse gas emission reduction plan including it goal of net zero greenhouse gas emission scope and from unconventional operated asset in the permian basin volume are based on projected field and facility production profile throughput or sale management estimate of upstream production volume used for projected cash flow make use of proved reserve quantity and may include risk adjusted unproved reserve quantity cash flow estimate for impairment testing exclude the effect of derivative instrument part of the corporate plan the company considers estimated greenhouse gas emission cost even for jurisdiction without current greenhouse gas pricing policy fair value of impaired asset an asset group is impaired if it estimated undiscounted cash flow are le than the asset group carrying value impairment are measured by the excess of the carrying value over fair value the assessment of fair value is based upon the view of likely market participant the principal parameter used to establish fair value include estimate of acreage value and flowing production metric from comparable market transaction market based estimate of historical cash flow multiple and discounted cash flow input and assumption used in discounted cash flow model include estimate of future production volume throughput and product sale volume commodity price which are consistent with the average of third party industry expert and government agency refining and chemical margin drilling and development cost operating cost and discount rate which are reflective of the characteristic of the asset group other impairment related to property plant and equipment unproved property are assessed periodically to determine whether they have been impaired significant unproved property are assessed for impairment individually and valuation allowance against the capitalized cost are recorded based on the corporation future development plan the estimated economic chance of success and the length of time that the corporation expects to hold the property property that are not individually significant are aggregated by group and amortized based on development risk and average holding period long lived asset that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with it fair value le the cost to sell if the net book value exceeds the fair value le cost to sell the asset are considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value gain on sale of proved and unproved property are only recognized when there is neither uncertainty about the recovery of cost applicable to any interest retained nor any substantial obligation for future performance by the corporation note to consolidated financial statementsenvironmental liabilitiesliabilities for environmental cost are recorded when it is probable that obligation have been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated these liability are not reduced by possible recovery from third party and projected cash expenditure are not discounted foreign currency translationthe corporation selects the functional reporting currency for it international subsidiary based on the currency of the primary economic environment in which each subsidiary operates operation in the product solution business use the local currency however the dollar is used in country with history of high inflation primarily in latin america and singapore which predominantly sell into the dollar export market upstream operation which are relatively self contained and integrated within particular country such in canada and europe use the local currency

result from significant change in either development strategy or production equipment facility capacity proved reserve include percent of each majority owned affiliate participation in proved reserve and exxonmobil ownership percentage of the proved reserve of equity company but exclude royalty and quantity due others natural gas reserve exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquid expected to be removed from the natural gas on lease at field facility and at gas processing plant these liquid are included in net proved reserve of crude oil and natural gas liquid in the proved reserve table consolidated reserve and equity company reserve are reported separately however the corporation doe not view equity company reserve any differently than those from consolidated company reserve reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreement are based on the economic interest defined by the specific fiscal term in the agreement the production and reserve reported for these type of arrangement typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price change oil and natural gas price increase the cash flow and value received by the company increase however the production volume and reserve required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher price when price decrease the opposite effect generally occurs the percentage of total proved reserve consolidated subsidiary plus equity company at year end that were associated with production sharing contract arrangement wa percent on an oil equivalent basis natural gas is converted to an oil equivalent basis at six billion cubic foot per one million barrel net proved developed reserve are those volume that are expected to be recovered through existing well with existing equipment and operating method or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of new well net proved undeveloped reserve are those volume that are expected to be recovered from new well on undrilled acreage or from existing well where relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion crude oil natural gas liquid and natural gas production quantity shown are the net volume withdrawn from exxonmobil oil and natural gas reserve the natural gas quantity differ from the quantity of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function reported in the upstream operational result due to volume consumed or flared and inventory change the change between year end proved reserve and year end proved reserve include worldwide production of billion oil equivalent barrel goeb asset sale of goeb primarily in the united state and other downward revision of goeb including the impact of the russia expropriation goeb addition to proved reserve include goeb from purchase in asia and goeb from extension and discovery primarily in the united state and guyana the change between year end proved reserve and year end proved reserve reflect upward revision of billion barrel of bitumen at kearl and billion barrel of bitumen at cold lake primarily result of improved price in addition extension and discovery of approximately goeb occurred primarily in the united state goeb brazil goeb and guyana goeb worldwide production in wa goeb the downward revision in primarily result of low price during include billion barrel of bitumen at kearl billion barrel of
