within the wireless communication service industry include pricing market saturation service and product offering customer experience network investment and quality development and deployment of technology availability of additional spectrum license and regulatory change competitor have shown willingness to use aggressive pricing source of differentiation other competitor have sought to add ancillary service like mobile video or music streaming service to enhance their offering taken together the competitive factor we face continue to put pressure on growth and margin company compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customer employeesas of december we employed approximately full time and part time employee including network retail administrative and customer support function regulation the fcc regulates many key aspect of our business including licensing construction the operation and use of our network modification of our network control and ownership of our license and authorization the sale transfer and acquisition of certain license domestic roaming arrangement and interconnection agreement pursuant to it authority under the communication act of amended communication act the fcc ha number of complex requirement that affect our operation and pending proceeding regarding additional or modified requirement that could increase our cost or diminish our revenue for example the fcc ha rule regarding provision of and service porting telephone number interconnection roaming internet openness or net neutrality disability access privacy and cybersecurity consumer protection and the universal service and lifeline program many of these and other issue are considered in ongoing proceeding and we not predict whether or such action will affect our business financial condition or result of operation our ability to provide service and generate revenue could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or change to existing law and regulation in addition regulation of company that offer competing service can impact our business indirectly except for operation in certain unlicensed frequency band wireless communication service provider generally must be licensed by the fcc to provide communication service at specified spectrum frequency within specified geographic area and must comply with the rule and policy governing the use of the spectrum adopted by the fcc the fcc issue each license for fixed period of time typically year depending on the particular license while the fcc ha generally renewed license given to operating company like the fcc ha authority to both revoke license for cause and to deny license renewal if renewal is not in the public interest furthermore we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty for failure to comply with fcc regulation even if any such non compliance wa unintentional in extreme case penalty can include revocation of our license the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business result of operation and financial condition additionally congress and the fcc allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service cmrs which includes cellular pc miscellaneous wireless service and specialized mobile radio could significantly increase and intensify competition we can not ass the impact that any development that may occur in the economy or any future spectrum allocation by the fcc may have on license value fcc spectrum auction and other market of contentsdevelopments may adversely affect the market value of our license in the future significant decline in the value of our license could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operation in addition the fcc periodically review it policy on how to evaluate carrier spectrum holding change in these policy could affect spectrum resource and competition among and other carrier congress and the fcc have imposed limitation on foreign ownership of cmrs licensee that exceed direct ownership or indirect ownership through an entity controlling the licensee the fcc ha ruled that higher level of indirect foreign ownership even up to are presumptively consistent with the public interest but must be reviewed and approved consistent with that established policy the fcc ha issued declaratory ruling authorizing up to ownership of our company by dt this declaratory ruling and our license are conditioned on dt and the company compliance with network security agreement with the department of justice the federal bureau of investigation and the department of homeland security failure to comply with the term of this agreement could result in fine injunction and other penalty including potential revocation of our spectrum license while the communication act generally preempt state and local government from regulating the entry of or the rate charged by wireless communication service provider certain state and local government regulate other term and condition of wireless service including billing termination of service arrangement and the imposition of early termination fee advertising network outage the use of device while driving zoning and land use additionally after the fcc adoption of the restoring internet freedom rif order reclassifying broadband internet access service title non common carrier service number of state have sought to impose state specific net neutrality and privacy requirement on provider broadband service the fcc ruling broadly preempted such state effort which are inconsistent with the fcc federal deregulatory approach recently however the dc circuit issued ruling largely upholding the rif order but also vacating the portion of the ruling broadly preempting state local net neutrality law the court left open the prospect that particular state law could still unlawfully conflict with the fcc net neutrality rule and be preempted petition seeking rehearing of the decision ha been filed court challenge to some of the state enactment also remain pending while most state are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rule there are difference in some state notably california which ha passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation there are also effort within congress to pas federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirement while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirement including the california law if not rescinded separate state requirement will impose significant business cost and could also result in increased litigation cost and enforcement risk state authority over wireless broadband service will remain unsettled final action by the court or congress in addition the federal trade commission ftc and other federal agency have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of non common carrier service further the fcc and the federal aviation administration regulate the siting lighting and construction of transmitter tower and antenna tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning well federal statute regarding environmental and historic preservation the future cost to comply with all relevant regulation are to some extent unknown and change to regulation or the applicability of regulation could result in higher operating and capital expense or reduced revenue in the future available informationthe sec maintains an

ability to attract and retain customer and adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we have multiple wireless competitor some of which have greater resource than we have and compete for customer based principally on service device offering price network coverage speed and quality and customer service we expect market saturation to continue to cause the wireless industry customer growth rate to be moderate in comparison with historical growth rate or possibly negative leading to ongoing competition for customer we also expect that our customer appetite for data service will place increasing demand on our network capacity this competition and our capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing and margin company compete for potential customer our ability to compete will depend on among other thing continued absolute and relative improvement in network quality and customer service effective marketing and selling of product and service innovation attractive pricing and cost management all of which will involve significant expense joint venture merger acquisition and strategic alliance in the wireless sector have resulted in and are expected to result in larger competitor competing for limited number of customer the two largest national wireless communication service provider currently serve significant percentage of all wireless customer and hold significant spectrum and other resource our largest competitor may be able to enter into exclusive handset device or content arrangement execute pervasive advertising and marketing campaign or otherwise improve their cost position relative to in addition refusal of our large competitor to provide critical access to resource and input such roaming service on reasonable term could improve their position within the wireless broadband mobile service industry we face intense and increasing competition from other service provider industry sector converge such cable telecom service and content satellite and other service provider company like comcast and at with acquisition of directv and time warner inc will have the scale and asset to aggressively compete in converging industry verizon through it acquisition of aol inc and yahoo inc is also significant competitor focusing on premium content offering to diversify outside of core wireless further some of our competitor provide content service in addition to voice and broadband service and consumer are increasingly accessing video content from internet based provider and application all of which create increased competition in this area these factor together with the effect of the increasing aggregate penetration of wireless service in all metropolitan area and the ability of our larger competitor to use resource to build out their network and to quickly deploy advanced technology such could make it more difficult for to continue to attract and retain customer and may adversely affect our competitive position and ability to grow which would have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result the scarcity and cost of additional wireless spectrum and regulation relating to spectrum use may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we will need to acquire additional spectrum in order to continue our customer growth expand and deepen our coverage maintain our quality of service meet increasing customer demand and deploy new technology we will be at competitive disadvantage and possibly experience erosion in the quality of service in certain geographic area if we fail to gain access to necessary spectrum reaching network capacity result we are actively seeking to make additional investment in spectrum which could be significant the continued interest in and acquisition of spectrum by existing carrier and others may reduce our ability to acquire and or increase the cost of acquiring spectrum in the secondary market or negatively impact our ability to gain access to spectrum through other mean including government auction we may need to enter into spectrum sharing or leasing arrangement which are subject to certain risk and uncertainty and may involve significant expenditure in addition our return on investment in spectrum depends on our ability to attract additional customer and to provide additional service and usage to existing customer result the return on any investment in spectrum that we make may not be much we anticipate or take longer than expected additionally the fcc may not be able to provide sufficient additional spectrum to auction or we may be unable to secure the spectrum we need in any auction we may elect to participate in or in the secondary market on favorable term or at all the fcc may impose condition on the use of new wireless broadband mobile spectrum that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area additional condition that may be imposed by the fcc include heightened build out requirement limited license term or renewal right and clearing obligation that may make it le attractive or le economical to acquire spectrum in addition rule may be established for future government of contentsspectrum auction that may negatively impact our ability to obtain spectrum economically or in appropriate configuration or coverage area if we can not acquire needed spectrum from the government or otherwise if competitor acquire spectrum that will allow them to provide service competitive with our service or if we can not deploy service over acquired spectrum on timely basis without burdensome condition at reasonable cost and while maintaining network quality level our ability to attract and retain customer and our business financial condition and operating result could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to take advantage of technological development on timely basis we may experience decline in demand for our service or face challenge in implementing or evolving our business strategy significant technological change continue to impact the communication industry in general these technological change enhance communication and enable broader array of company to offer service competitive with ours in order to grow and remain competitive with new and evolving technology in our industry we will need to adapt to future change in technology continually invest in our network increase network capacity enhance our existing offering and introduce new offering to address our current and potential customer changing demand enhancing our network including our network is subject to risk from equipment change and migration of customer from older technology and the potential inability to secure mid band spectrum that is necessary to add capacity to advanced technology adopting new and sophisticated technology may result in implementation issue such scheduling and supplier delay unexpected or increased cost technological constraint regulatory permitting issue customer dissatisfaction and other issue that could cause delay in launching new technological capability which in turn could result in significant cost or reduce the anticipated benefit of the upgrade in general the development of new service in the wireless telecommunication industry will require to anticipate and respond to the continuously changing demand of our customer which we may not be able to do accurately or timely if our new service fail to retain or gain acceptance in the marketplace or if cost associated with these service are higher than anticipated this could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we could be harmed by data loss or other security breach whether directly or indirectly our business like that of most retailer and wireless company involves the receipt storage

of confidential information in august and november we notified affected customer of incident involving unauthorized access to certain customer information not involving credit card information financial data social security number or password while we do not believe these security incident were material we expect to continue to be the target of cyber attack data breach or security incident which may in the future have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial condition and operating result cyber attack such denial of service and other malicious attack could disrupt our internal system and application impair our ability to provide service to our customer and have other adverse effect on our business and that of others who depend on our service telecommunication

addition we provide confidential proprietary and personal information to third party service provider part of our business operation these third party service provider have experienced data breach and other attack that included unauthorized access to confidential information in the past and face security challenge common to all party that collect and process information past data breach include breach of the network of one of our credit decisioning provider in september during which subset of record containing current and potential customer information wa acquired by an external party our procedure and safeguard to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data and to defend against attack seeking to disrupt our service must be continually evaluated and revised to address the ever evolving threat landscape we can not make assurance that all preventive action taken will adequately repel significant attack or prevent information security breach or the misuse of data unauthorized

effect on our business we continue implementing new customer billing system that involves new third party supported platform and utilization of phased deployment approach element of the billing system have been placed into service and are operational and we plan to operate both the existing and new billing system in parallel to aid in the transition to the new system until all phase of the conversion are complete the ongoing implementation may cause major system or business disruption or we may fail to implement the new billing system in it entirety or in timely or effective manner in addition we or the supporting vendor may experience error cyber attack or other operational disruption that could negatively impact and over which we may have limited control interruption and or failure of this billing service system could disrupt our operation and impact our ability to provide or bill for our service retain customer attract new customer or negatively impact overall customer experience any occurrence of the foregoing could cause material adverse effect on our operation and financial condition material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and reputational damage we rely on third party to provide product and service for the operation of our business and the failure or inability of such party to provide these product or service could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we depend heavily on supplier service provider their subcontractor and other third party for to efficiently operate our business due to the complexity of our business it is not unusual to engage diverse set of supplier to help develop maintain and troubleshoot product and service such network component software development service and billing and customer service support some of our supplier may provide service from outside of the united state which carry additional regulatory and legal obligation we commonly rely on supplier to provide with contractual assurance and to disclose accurate information regarding risk associated with their provision of product or service in accordance with our of contentspolicies and standard including our supplier code of conduct and our third party risk management practice the failure of our supplier to comply with our expectation and policy could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result many of the product and service we use are available through multiple source and supplier however there are limited number of supplier who can support or provide billing service voice and data communication transport service network infrastructure equipment handset other device and payment processing service among other product and service disruption or failure of such supplier to adequately perform could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result in the past our supplier service provider and their subcontractor may not have always performed at the level we expected or at the level required by their contract our business could be severely disrupted if critical supplier or service provider fail to comply with their contract or if we experience delay or service degradation during any transition to new outsourcing provider or other supplier or if we are required to replace the supplied product or service with those from another source especially if the replacement becomes necessary on short notice any such disruption could have material adverse effect on our business financial

which may be more vulnerable to weak economic condition particularly our subprime customer we may have greater difficulty in gaining new customer within this segment and existing customer may be more likely to terminate service and default on device financing plan due to an inability to pay weak economic condition and credit condition may also adversely impact our supplier dealer and mvnos some of which may file for or may be considering bankruptcy or may experience cash flow or liquidity problem or may be unable to obtain or refinance credit such that may no longer be able to operate any of these could adversely impact our ability to distribute market or sell our product and service in addition instability in the global financial market could lead to periodic volatility in the credit equity and fixed income market this volatility could limit our access to the credit market leading to higher borrowing cost or in some case the inability to obtain financing on term that are

our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business or the communication industry or pursuing growth opportunity reducing the amount of cash available for other operational or strategic need and placing at competitive disadvantage to competitor who are le leveraged than we are any hedging agreement we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation may not offer complete protection from these risk or may be unsuccessful and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt and any portion not subject to such hedging agreement would have full exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation applicable we are exposed to credit related loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our hedging agreement the primary credit exposure that we have with respect to our hedging agreement is that counterparty will default on payment due which could result in to acquire replacement derivative from different counterparty at higher cost or we may be unable to find suitable replacement the counterparties to our hedging agreement are all major financial institution however this not eliminate our exposure to credit risk with these institution in addition any netting and or set off right we may have through master netting arrangement with these counterparties may not apply to affiliate of counterparty with we may have various other financial arrangement if any financial institution that are party to our hedging agreement were to default on their payment obligation to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent we would be unhedged against the underlying exposure any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result additionally under some of our hedging agreement the counterparties and our obligation are required to be secured by cash or treasury security subject to defined threshold any additional posting of collateral by under these arrangement would negatively impact our liquidity the modification or termination of our hedging agreement could also negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metric some of our debt ha variable rate of interest linked to various index if the change in index result in interest rate increase our debt service requirement will increase which could adversely affect our cash flow and operating result in particular some or all of our variable rate indebtedness may use the london inter bank offered rate libor or similar rate benchmark for establishing the rate libor will be discontinued after and will be replaced with an alternative reference rate the consequence of this development can not be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness failure to maintain effective internal control in accordance with section of

disclosure or failure to prevent fraud if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting investor confidence regarding our financial statement and our business could be materially adversely affected our financial condition and operating result will be impaired if we experience high fraud rate related to device financing credit card dealer or subscription our operating cost could increase substantially result of fraud including any fraud related to device financing customer credit card subscription or dealer if our fraud detection strategy and process are not successful in detecting and controlling fraud whether directly or by way of the system process and operation of third party such national retailer dealer and others the resulting loss of revenue or increased expense could have material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating result we rely on highly skilled personnel throughout all level of our business our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel hire qualified personnel or maintain our corporate culture the market for highly skilled worker and leader in our industry is extremely competitive we believe that our future success depends in substantial part on our ability to recruit hire motivate develop and retain talented and highly skilled personnel for all area of our organization including our ceo the other member of our senior leadership team and highly skilled employee in technical marketing and staff position so may be difficult due to many factor including fluctuation in economic and industry condition change to immigration policy competitor hiring practice employee tolerance for the significant amount of change within and demand on our company and our industry and the effectiveness of our compensation program our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain and motivate our existing employee and to attract new employee if we do not succeed in retaining and motivating our existing key employee and attracting new key personnel we may not be able to meet our business plan and result our revenue growth and profitability may be materially adversely affected in addition certain member of our senior leadership team including our ceo have term employment agreement with our inability to extend the term of these employment agreement or to replace these member or our senior leadership team at the end of their term with qualified and capable successor could hinder our strategic planning and execution in november we announced that john legere would retire our chief executive officer on april our ability to execute our business strategy and retain key executive may be adversely affected by the transition to our successor michael sievert any acquisition investment or merger may subject to significant risk any of which may harm our business we may pursue acquisition of investment in or merger with business technology service and or product that complement or expand our business some of these potential transaction could be significant relative to the size of our business and operation any such transaction would involve number of risk and could present financial managerial and operational challenge including diversion of management attention from running our existing business increased cost to integrate the network spectrum technology personnel customer base and business practice of the business involved in any such transaction with our business difficulty in effectively integrating the financial and operational system of the business involved in any such transaction into or supplanting such system with our financial and operational reporting infrastructure and internal control framework in an effective and timely manner potential exposure to material liability not discovered in the due diligence process or result of any litigation arising in connection with any such transaction significant transaction expense in connection with any such transaction whether consummated or not risk related to our ability to obtain any required regulatory approval necessary to consummate any such transaction acquisition financing may not be available on reasonable term or at all and any such financing could significantly increase our outstanding indebtedness or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit rating and any business technology service or product involved in any such transaction may significantly under perform relative to our expectation and we may not achieve the benefit we expect from the transaction which could among other thing also result in write of goodwill and other intangible asset associated with such transaction for any or all of these reason our pursuit of an acquisition investment or merger may have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result of contentsrisks related to legal and regulatory matterschanges in regulation or in the regulatory framework under which we operate could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result the fcc regulates the licensing construction modification operation ownership sale and interconnection of wireless communication system do some state and local regulatory agency in particular the fcc imposes significant regulation on licensee of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensee the nature of the service that licensee may offer and how the service may be offered and the resolution of issue of interference spectrum band additionally the ftc and other federal and state agency have asserted that they have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practice with respect to the provision of wireless product and service we are subject to regulatory oversight by various federal state and local agency well judicial review and action on issue related to the wireless industry that include but are not limited to roaming interconnection spectrum allocation and licensing facility siting pole attachment intercarrier compensation universal service fund usf net neutrality service consumer protection consumer privacy and cybersecurity we are also subject to regulation in connection with other aspect of our business including handset financing and insurance activity we can not assure that the fcc or any other federal state or local agency will not adopt regulation or take enforcement or other action that would adversely affect our business impose new cost or require change in current or planned operation for example under the obama administration the fcc established net neutrality and privacy regime that applied to our operation both set of rule potentially subjected some of our initiative and practice to more burdensome requirement and heightened scrutiny by federal and state regulator the public edge provider and private litigant regarding whether such initiative or practice are compliant while the fcc rule are now largely rolled back under the trump administration some state and other jurisdiction have enacted or are considering enacting law in these area including for example the ccpa cited below perpetuating the risk and uncertainty regarding the regulatory environment and compliance around these issue in addition state are increasingly focused on the quality of service and support that wireless communication service provider provide to their customer and several state have proposed or enacted new and potentially burdensome regulation in this area we also face potential investigation by and inquiry from or action by state public utility commission we also can not assure you that congress will not amend the communication act from which the fcc obtains it authority and which serf to limit state authority or enact other legislation in manner that could be adverse to our business additionally in june california passed the california consumer privacy act the ccpa effective january creating new data privacy right for california resident and new compliance obligation for we have incurred and will continue to incur significant implementation cost to ensure compliance with the ccpa and we could see increased litigation cost with the law now in effect the california attorney general ha proposed related ccpa regulation which could be adopted in form that increase our cost and or litigation exposure if we are unable to put proper control and procedure in place to ensure compliance it could have an adverse effect on our business california ballot initiative ha recently been introduced by the original proponent of the ccpa that would provide additional data privacy right and require additional implementation process if passed other state such nevada and washington have passed or are considering similar legislation which if passed could create more risk and potential cost for especially to the extent the specific requirement of these law vary significantly from those in california nevada and other existing law failure to comply with applicable regulation could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we could be subject to fine forfeiture and other penalty including in extreme case revocation of our spectrum license for failure to comply with fcc or other governmental regulation even if any such non compliance wa unintentional the loss of any license or any related fine or forfeiture could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result unfavorable outcome of legal proceeding may adversely affect our business financial condition and operating result we are regularly involved in number of legal proceeding before various state and federal court the fcc the ftc other federal agency and state and local regulatory agency including state attorney general such legal proceeding can be complex costly and highly disruptive to our business operation by diverting the attention and energy of management and other key personnel the assessment of the outcome of legal proceeding including our potential liability if any is highly subjective process that requires judgment about future event that are not within our control the amount ultimately received or paid upon settlement or pursuant to final judgment order or decree may differ materially from amount accrued in our financial statement in addition litigation or similar proceeding could impose restraint on our current or future manner of of contentsdoing business such potential outcome including judgment award settlement or order could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we offer highly regulated financial service product these product expose to wide variety of state and federal regulation the financing of device through our eip and jump on demand program ha expanded our regulatory compliance obligation failure to remain compliant with applicable regulation may increase our risk exposure in the following area consumer complaint and potential examination or enforcement action by federal and state regulatory agency including but not limited to the consumer financial protection bureau state attorney general the fcc and the ftc and regulatory fine penalty enforcement action civil litigation and or class action lawsuit failure to comply with applicable regulation and the realization of any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result we may not be able to adequately protect the intellectual property right on which our business depends or may be accused of infringing intellectual property right of third party we rely on combination of patent service mark trademark and trade secret law and contractual restriction to establish and protect our proprietary right all of which offer limited protection the step we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary right we may not have the ability in certain jurisdiction to adequately protect intellectual property right moreover others may independently develop process and technology that are competitive to ours also we may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary right unauthorized use of our intellectual property right may increase the cost of protecting these right or reduce our revenue we can not be sure that any legal action against such infringers will be successful even when our right have been infringed we can not assure you that our pending or future patent application will be granted or enforceable or that the right granted under any patent that may be issued will provide with any competitive advantage in addition we can not assure you that any trademark or service mark registration will be issued with respect to pending or future application or will provide adequate protection of our brand we do not have insurance coverage for intellectual property loss and such charge for an anticipated settlement or an adverse ruling awarding damage represents an unplanned loss event any of these factor could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result third party may claim we infringe their intellectual property right we are defendant in numerous intellectual property lawsuit including patent infringement lawsuit which expose to the risk of adverse financial impact either by way of significant settlement amount or damage award we adopt new technology and new business system and provide customer with new product and or service we may face additional infringement claim these claim could require to cease certain activity or to cease selling relevant product and service these claim can be time consuming and costly to defend and divert management resource and expose to significant damage award or settlement any or all of which could have material adverse effect on our operation and financial condition in addition to litigation directly involving our company our vendor and supplier can be threatened with patent litigation and or subjected to the threat of disruption or blockage of sale use or importation of product posing the risk of supply chain interruption to particular product and associated service which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result our business may be impacted by new or amended tax law or regulation judicial interpretation of same or administrative action by federal state and or local taxing authority in connection with the product and service we sell we calculate collect and remit various federal state and local tax fee and regulatory charge tax or tax to numerous federal state and local governmental authority including federal usf contribution and common carrier regulatory fee in addition we incur and pay state and local tax and fee on purchase of good and service used in our business tax law are dynamic and subject to change new law are passed and new interpretation of the law are issued or applied in many case the application of existing newly enacted or amended tax law such the tax cut and job act of may be uncertain and subject to differing interpretation especially when evaluated against new technology and telecommunication service such broadband internet access and cloud related service change in tax law could also impact revenue reported on tax inclusive plan of contentsin the event that we have incorrectly described disclosed determined calculated assessed or remitted amount that were due to governmental authority we could be subject to additional tax fine penalty or other adverse action which could materially impact our business financial condition and operating result in the event that federal state and or local municipality were to significantly increase tax on our network operation or service or seek to impose new tax it could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result our wireless license are subject to renewal and may be revoked in the event that we violate applicable law our existing wireless license are subject to renewal upon the expiration of the year or year period for which they are granted historically the fcc ha approved our license renewal application however the communication act provides that license may be revoked for cause and license renewal application denied if the fcc determines that renewal would not serve the public interest in addition our license are subject to our compliance with the term set forth in the agreement pertaining to national security among dt the federal bureau of investigation the department of justice and the department of homeland security the failure of dt or the company to comply with the term of this agreement could result in fine injunction and other penalty including potential revocation or non renewal of our spectrum license if we fail to timely file to renew any wireless license or fail to meet any regulatory requirement for renewal including construction and substantial service requirement we could be denied license renewal many of our wireless license are subject to interim or final construction requirement and there is no guarantee that the fcc will find our construction or the construction of prior licensee sufficient to meet the build out or renewal requirement accordingly we can not assure you that the fcc will renew our wireless license upon their expiration if any of our wireless license were to be revoked or not renewed upon expiration we would not be permitted to provide service under that license which could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result our business could be adversely affected by finding of product liability for health or safety risk from wireless device and transmission equipment well by change to regulation or radio frequency emission standard we do not manufacture the device or other equipment that we sell and we depend on our supplier to provide defect free and safe equipment supplier are required by applicable law to manufacture their device to meet certain governmentally imposed safety criterion however even if the device we sell meet the regulatory safety criterion we could be held liable with the equipment manufacturer and supplier for any harm caused by product we sell if such product are later found to have design or manufacturing defect we generally seek to enter into indemnification agreement with the manufacturer who supply with device to protect from loss associated with product liability but we can not guarantee that we will be protected in whole or in part against loss associated with product that is found to be defective allegation have been made that the use of wireless handset and wireless transmission equipment such cell tower may be linked to various health concern including cancer and brain tumor lawsuit have been filed against manufacturer and carrier in the industry claiming damage for alleged health problem arising from the use of wireless handset in addition the fcc ha from time to time gathered data regarding wireless handset emission and it assessment of this issue may evolve based on it finding the medium ha also reported incident of handset battery malfunction including report of battery that have overheated these allegation may lead to change in regulatory standard there have also been other allegation regarding wireless technology including allegation that wireless handset emission may interfere with various electronic medical device including hearing aid and pacemaker airbags and anti lock brake defect in the product of our supplier such the recall by handset original equipment manufacturer of one of it smartphone device could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result any of these allegation or risk could result in customer purchasing fewer device and wireless service and could also result in significant legal and regulatory liability additionally there are safety risk associated with the use of wireless device while operating vehicle or equipment concern over any of these risk and the effect of any legislation rule or regulation that have been and may be adopted in response to these risk could limit our ability to sell our wireless service risk related to ownership of our common stockwe are controlled by dt whose interest may differ from

experienced significant price and volume fluctuation which may continue for the foreseeable future this volatility ha had significant impact on the trading price of security issued by many company including company in the communication industry these change frequently occur irrespective of the operating performance of the affected company hence the trading price of our common stock could

repurchase any dollar amount or number of share of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline the timing and actual number of share repurchased under any such stock repurchase program depends on variety of factor including the timing of open trading window the price of our common stock corporate and regulatory requirement and other market condition we may effect repurchase under any stock repurchase program from time to time in the open market in privately negotiated transaction or otherwise including accelerated stock repurchase arrangement repurchase pursuant to any such stock repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase it volatility the existence of stock repurchase program could also cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock there can be no assurance that any stock repurchase will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the level at which we repurchased share of common stock although our stock repurchase program

related to integration and the combined companyalthough we expect that the transaction will result in synergy and other benefit those synergy and benefit may not be realized or may not be realized within the expected time frame and risk associated with the foregoing may increase result of the extended delay in the completion of the transaction our ability to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction will depend to large extent on the combined company ability to integrate our and sprint business in manner that facilitates growth opportunity and achieves the projected standalone cost saving and revenue growth trend identified by each company without adversely affecting current revenue and investment in future growth in addition some of the anticipated synergy are not expected to occur for significant time period following the completion of the transaction and will require substantial capital expenditure in the near term to be fully realized moreover additional delay in the completion of the transaction may delay reduce or eliminate the anticipated synergy and other benefit of the transaction including result of the delay in the integration of or inability to integrate the network of mobile and sprint to launch broad and deep nationwide network and increasing cost and expense incurred by mobile and sprint during the pendency of the transaction even if the combined company is able to integrate the two company successfully the anticipated benefit of the transaction including the expected synergy and network benefit may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected our business and sprint business may not be integrated successfully or such integration may be more difficult time consuming or costly than expected operating cost customer loss and business disruption including difficulty in of contentscompleting the divestiture transaction satisfying all of the government commitment and maintaining relationship with employee customer supplier or vendor may be greater than expected following the transaction revenue following the transaction may be lower than expected the combination of two independent business is complex costly and time consuming and may divert significant management attention and resource to combining our and sprint business practice and operation this process well the divestiture transaction and the government commitment may disrupt our business or otherwise impact our ability to compete the failure to meet the challenge involved in combining our and sprint business and to realize the anticipated benefit of the transaction could cause an interruption of or loss of momentum in the activity of the combined company and could adversely affect the result of operation of the combined company the overall combination of our and sprint business the completion of the divestiture transaction and compliance with the government commitment may also result in material unanticipated problem expense liability competitive response and impact and loss of customer and other business relationship the difficulty of combining the operation of the company completing the divestiture transaction and

property and communication system administrative and information technology infrastructure and financial reporting and internal control system challenge in conforming standard control procedure and accounting and other policy business culture and compensation structure between the two company difference in control environment culture and auditor expectation may result in future material weakness significant deficiency and or control deficiency while we work to integrate the company and align guideline and practice alignment of key performance measurement may result in greater need to

divestiture process for the divestiture transaction and the ongoing commercial and transition service arrangement to be entered into in connection with the divestiture transaction known or potential unknown liability arising in connection with the divestiture transaction that are larger than expected an increase in competition from dish and other third party that dish may enter into commercial agreement with who are significantly larger than we are and enjoy greater resource and scale advantage compared to difficulty in satisfying the large number of government commitment in the required timeframes and cost incurred in the tracking and monitoring of them including the network build out obligation under the government commitment known or potential unknown liability of sprint that are larger than expected and other potential adverse consequence and unforeseen increased expense or liability associated with the transaction the divestiture transaction and the government commitment some of these factor are outside of our control and or will be outside the control of the combined company and any one of them could result in lower revenue higher cost and diversion of management time and energy which could materially impact the business financial condition and result of operation of the combined company in addition even if the operation of our and sprint business are integrated successfully the full benefit of the merger may not be realized including among others the synergy cost saving or sale or growth opportunity that are expected including result of the divestiture transaction the government commitment and or the other action and condition we have agreed to in connection with the transaction or otherwise these benefit may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all further additional unanticipated cost may be incurred in the integration of our and sprint business and in connection with the divestiture transaction and the government commitment including potential penalty that could arise if we fail to fulfill our obligation thereunder all of these factor could suppress the earnings per share of the combined company decrease or delay the projected accretive effect of the merger and negatively impact the price of our common stock following the merger result it can not be assured that the combination of mobile and sprint will result in the realization of the full benefit expected from the transaction within the anticipated time frame or at all of contentsthe indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the transaction will be substantially greater than the indebtedness of each of mobile and sprint on standalone basis prior to the execution of the business combination agreement this increased level of indebtedness could adversely affect the combined company business flexibility and increase it borrowing cost in connection with the transaction we and sprint have conducted and expect to conduct certain pre merger financing transaction which will be used in part to prepay portion of our and sprint existing indebtedness and to fund liquidity need after giving effect to the pre merger financing transaction and the transaction we anticipate that the combined company will have consolidated indebtedness of up to approximately billion to billion based on estimated december debt and cash balance and excluding tower obligation and operating lease liability our substantially increased indebtedness following the transaction could have the effect among other thing of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business economic market and industry condition and increasing the amount of cash required to meet interest payment in addition this increased level of indebtedness following the transaction may reduce fund available to support effort to combine our and sprint business and realize the expected benefit of the transaction and may also reduce fund available for capital expenditure share repurchase and other activity that may put the combined company at competitive disadvantage relative to other company with lower debt level further it may be necessary for the combined company to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restriction contained in it debt instrument which could increase the risk associated with the capital structure of the combined company because of the substantial indebtedness of the combined company following the completion of the transaction there is risk that the combined company may not be able to service it debt obligation in accordance with their term the ability of the combined company to service it substantial debt obligation following the transaction will depend on future performance which will be affected by business economic market and industry condition and other factor including the ability of the combined company to achieve the expected benefit of the transaction there is no guarantee that the combined company will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service it debt obligation when due if the combined company is unable to meet such obligation or fails to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenant contained in the agreement governing such debt obligation it may be required to refinance all or part of it debt sell important strategic asset at unfavorable price or make additional borrowing the combined company may not be able to at any given time refinance it debt sell asset or make additional borrowing on commercially reasonable term or at all which could have material adverse effect on it business financial condition and result of operation after the transaction some or all of the combined company variable rate indebtedness may use libor benchmark for establishing the rate libor will be discontinued after and will be replaced with an alternative reference rate the consequence of this development can not be entirely predicted but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness in addition any hedging agreement we have and may continue to enter into to limit our exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation may not offer complete protection from these risk or may be unsuccessful and consequently may effectively increase the interest rate we pay on our debt or the exchange rate with respect to such debt and any portion not subject to such hedging agreement would have full exposure to interest rate increase or foreign currency fluctuation applicable if any financial institution that are party to our hedging agreement were to default on their payment obligation to declare bankruptcy or become insolvent we would be unhedged against the underlying exposure any posting of collateral by under our hedging agreement and the modification or termination of any of our hedging agreement could negatively impact our liquidity or other financial metric any of these risk could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating result the agreement governing the combined company indebtedness and other financing will include restrictive covenant that limit the combined company operating flexibility the agreement governing the combined company indebtedness and other financing will impose material operating and financial restriction on the combined company these restriction subject in certain case to customary basket exception and maintenance and incurrence based financial test may limit the combined company ability to engage in transaction and pursue strategic business opportunity including the following incurring additional indebtedness and issuing preferred stock paying dividend redeeming capital stock or making other restricted payment or investment selling or buying asset property or license developing asset property or license which the combined company ha or in the future may procure of content creating lien on asset securing indebtedness or other obligation participating in future fcc auction of spectrum or private sale of spectrum engaging in merger acquisition business combination or other transaction entering into transaction with affiliate and placing restriction on the ability of subsidiary to pay dividend or make other payment these restriction could limit the combined company ability to obtain debt financing make share repurchase refinance or pay principal on it outstanding indebtedness complete acquisition for cash or indebtedness or react to business economic market and industry condition and other change in it operating environment or the economy any future indebtedness that the combined company incurs may contain similar or more restrictive covenant any failure to comply with the restriction of the combined company debt agreement may result in an event of default under these agreement which in turn may result in default or acceleration of obligation under these and other agreement giving the combined company lender the right to terminate any commitment they had made to provide it with further fund and to require the combined company to repay all amount then outstanding plus any interest fee penalty or premium and which may include requiring the combined company to sell certain asset securing indebtedness the financing of the transaction is not assured we have received commitment for billion in debt financing to fund the transaction which is comprised of billion secured revolving credit facility ii billion term loan credit facility and iii billion secured bridge loan facility furthermore the merger financing commitment currently expire on may and if the completion of the transaction continues to be delayed any extension of the financing commitment or new financing commitment may not be obtained on the expected term or at all our reliance on the financing from the billion secured bridge loan facility commitment is intended to be reduced through one or more secured note offering or other long term financing prior to the merger closing however there can be no assurance that we will be able to issue any such secured note or other long term financing on term we find acceptable or at all especially in light of recent debt market volatility in which case we may have to exercise some or all of the commitment under the secured bridge facility to fund the transaction the obligation of the lender to provide these debt financing facility is subject to number of condition and the financing of the transaction may not be obtained on the expected term or at all accordingly the cost of financing for the transaction may be higher than expected credit rating downgrade could adversely affect the business cash flow

coordinating our and sprint business operation policy and procedure portion of the transaction cost related to the transaction will be incurred regardless of whether the transaction are completed while we have assumed that certain level of transaction expense will be incurred factor beyond our control could affect the total amount or the timing of these expense many of the expense that will be

arrangement see note sale of certain receivables of the note to the consolidated financial statement for further information critical accounting policy and estimatesour significant accounting policy are fundamental to understanding our result of operation and financial condition they require that we use estimate and assumption that may affect the value of our asset or liability and financial result see note summary of significant accounting policy of the note to the consolidated financial statement for further information eight of these policy discussed below are critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgment about matter that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amount would be reported under different condition or using different assumption actual result could differ from those estimate management and the audit committee of the board of director have reviewed and approved these critical accounting policy leaseswe adopted the new lease standard on january and recognized right of use asset and lease liability for operating lease that have not previously been recorded significant judgment the most significant judgment and impact upon adoption of the standard include the following in evaluating contract to determine if they qualify lease we consider factor such if we have obtained or transferred substantially all of the right to the underlying asset through exclusivity if we can or if we have transferred the ability to direct the use of the asset by making decision about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor ha substantive substitution right identification of lease may require significant judgment we recognized right of use asset and operating lease liability for operating lease that have not previously been recorded the lease liability for operating lease is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payment the right of use asset for operating lease is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amount such prepaid rent and deferred rent which we remeasured at adoption due to the application of hindsight to our lease term estimate deferred and prepaid rent will no longer be presented separately of content capital lease asset previously included within property and equipment net were reclassified to financing lease right of use asset and capital lease liability previously included in short term debt and long term debt were reclassified to financing lease liability in our consolidated balance sheet certain line item in the consolidated statement of cash flow and the supplemental disclosure of cash flow information have been renamed to align with the new terminology presented in the new lease standard repayment of capital lease obligation is now presented repayment of financing lease obligation and asset acquired under capital lease obligation is now presented financing lease right of use asset obtained in exchange for lease obligation in the operating activity section of the consolidated statement of cash flow we have added operating lease right of use asset and short and long term operating lease liability which represent the change in the operating lease asset and liability respectively additionally in the supplemental disclosure of cash flow information section of the consolidated statement of cash flow we have added operating lease payment and in the noncash investing and financing activity section we have added operating lease right of use asset obtained in exchange for lease obligation in determining the discount rate used to measure the right of use asset and lease liability we use rate implicit in the lease or if not readily available we use our incremental borrowing rate our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of risk free libor rate plus credit spread secured by our asset determining credit spread secured by our asset may require significant judgment certain of our lease agreement include rental payment based on change in the consumer price index cpi lease liability are not remeasured result of change in the cpi instead change in the cpi are treated variable lease payment and are excluded from the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability these payment are recognized in the period in which the related obligation wa incurred our lease agreement do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenant we elected the use of hindsight whereby we applied current lease term assumption that are applied to new lease in determining the expected lease term period for all cell site upon adoption of the new lease standard and application of hindsight our expected lease term ha shortened to reflect payment due for the initial non cancelable lease term only this assessment corresponds to our lease term assessment for new lease and aligns with the payment that have been disclosed lease commitment in prior year result the average remaining lease term for cell site ha decreased from approximately nine to five year based on lease contract in effect at transition on january the aggregate impact of using hindsight is an estimated decrease in total operating expense of million in fiscal year we were also required to reassess the previously failed sale leasebacks of certain mobile owned wireless communication tower site and determine whether the transfer of the asset to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criterion in the revenue standard and whether sale should be recognized determining whether the transfer of control criterion ha been met requires significant judgement we concluded that sale ha not occurred for the tower site transferred to crown castle international corp cci pursuant to master prepaid lease arrangement therefore these site will continue to be accounted for failed sale leasebacks we concluded that sale should be recognized for the tower site transferred to cci pursuant to the sale of subsidiary and for the tower site transferred to phoenix tower international pti upon adoption on january we derecognized our existing long term financial obligation and the tower related property and equipment associated with these previously failed sale leaseback tower site and recognized lease liability and right of use asset for the leaseback of the tower site the impact from the change in accounting conclusion are primarily decrease in other revenue of million and decrease in interest expense of million in fiscal year rental revenue and expense associated with co location tower site are presented on net basis under the new lease standard these revenue and expense were presented on gross basis under the former lease standard of contentslease expensewe have operating lease for cell site retail location corporate office and dedicated transportation line some of which have escalating rental during the initial lease term and during subsequent optional renewal period we recognize right of use asset and lease liability for operating lease based on the net present value of future minimum lease payment lease expense is recognized on straight line basis over the non cancelable lease term and renewal period that are considered reasonably certain we consider several factor in assessing whether renewal period are reasonably certain of being exercised including the continued maturation of our network nationwide technological advance within the telecommunication industry and the availability of alternative site see note summary of significant accounting policy and note lease of the note to the consolidated financial statement for further information revenue recognitionwe primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless service to customer and selling or leasing device and accessory our contract with customer may involve multiple performance obligation which include wireless service wireless device or combination thereof and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on it relative standalone selling price significant judgmentsthe most significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contract with our customer include the following item revenue for service contract that we ass are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received collectibility is re assessed when there is significant change in fact or circumstance our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent well certain contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see allowance below for more discussion on how we ass credit risk promotional eip bill credit offered to customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether substantive penalty is deemed to exist determining whether contingent eip bill credit result in substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment the identification of distinct performance obligation within our service plan may require significant judgment revenue is recorded net of cost paid to another party for performance obligation where we arrange for the other party to transfer good or service to the customer when we are acting an agent for example performance obligation relating to service provided by third party content provider where we neither control right to the content provider service control the underlying service are presented net because we are acting an agent the determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires at time significant judgment for transaction where we recognize significant financing component judgment is required to determine the discount rate for eip sale the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk of the customer customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see allowance below for more discussion on how we ass credit risk our product are generally sold with right of return which is accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize device return level are estimated based on the expected value method there are large number of contract with similar characteristic and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others historical return rate experience is significant input to our expected value methodology of content sale of equipment to indirect dealer who have been identified our customer referred to the sell in model often include credit subsequently paid to the dealer reimbursement for any discount promotion offered to the end consumer these credit payment to customer are accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sale of equipment to indirect dealer and are estimated based on historical experience and other factor such expected promotional activity the determination of the standalone selling price for contract that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment such when the selling price of good or service is not readily observable for capitalized contract cost determining the amortization period over which such cost are recognized well assessing the indicator of impairment may require significant judgment see note summary of significant accounting policy and note revenue from contract with customer of the note to the consolidated financial statement for further information allowanceswe maintain an allowance for credit loss which is management estimate of such loss inherent in our receivables portfolio comprised of account receivable and eip receivable segment change in the allowance for credit loss and therefore in related provision for credit loss bad debt expense can materially affect earnings credit risk characteristic are assessed for each receivable segment in applying the judgment and review required to determine the allowance for credit loss management considers number of factor including receivable volume receivable delinquency status historical loss experience and other condition influencing loss expectation such macro economic condition while our methodology attribute portion of the allowance to specific portfolio segment the entire allowance for credit loss is available to absorb credit loss inherent in the total receivables portfolio management also considers an amount that represents management judgment of risk inherent in the process and assumption used in establishing the allowance for credit loss including process risk and other subjective factor including industry trend and emerging risk assessment to the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trend or assumption the appropriate allowance level for realized credit loss could differ from the estimate we write off account balance if collection effort are unsuccessful and the receivable balance is deemed uncollectible based on factor such customer credit rating and the length of time from the original billing date we offer certain retail customer the option to pay for their device and other purchase in installment over period of up to month using an eip eip receivables not held for sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge offs allowance for credit loss and unamortized discount receivables held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value at the time of an installment sale we impute discount for interest if the eip term exceeds month there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables the eip receivables are recorded at their present value which is determined by discounting future cash payment at the imputed interest rate the difference between the recorded amount of the eip receivables and their unpaid principal balance the contractual amount due from the customer result in discount which is allocated to the performance obligation of the arrangement and recorded reduction in transaction price we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables result we do not recognize separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance the effect of uncertainty about future cash flow resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable the imputed discount on eip receivables is amortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized other revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount we ass the need for and if necessary recognize an allowance for credit loss to the extent the amount of estimated probable loss on the gross eip receivable balance exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balance deferred purchase price assetsin connection with the sale of certain service and eip account receivable pursuant to the sale arrangement we have deferred purchase price asset measured at fair value that are based on discounted cash flow model using unobservable level input including customer default rate and credit worthiness dilution and recovery see note sale of certain receivables of the note to the consolidated financial statement for further information of contentsdepreciationdepreciation commences asset have been placed in service we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected loss depreciable life study are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable life for certain category of property plant and equipment these study consider actual usage physical wear and tear replacement history and assumption about technology evolution when these factor indicate that the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment the remaining book value are depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life see note summary of significant accounting policy and note property and equipment of the note to the consolidated financial statement for information regarding depreciation of asset including management underlying estimate of useful life evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset for impairmentwe ass the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate such asset might be impaired we have identified two reporting unit for which discrete financial information is available and result are regularly reviewed by management wireless and the reporting unit consists of the asset and liability of tv inc which wa acquired in january the wireless reporting unit consists of the remaining asset and liability of mobile inc excluding tv inc we separately evaluate these reporting unit for impairment when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment for reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we employed qualitative approach to ass the wireless reporting unit the fair value of the wireless reporting unit is determined using market approach which is based on market capitalization we recognize market capitalization is subject to volatility and will monitor change in market capitalization to determine whether decline if any necessitate an interim impairment review in the event market capitalization doe decline below it book value we will consider the length severity and reason for the decline when assessing whether potential impairment exists including considering whether control premium should be added to the market capitalization we believe short term fluctuation in share price may not necessarily reflect the underlying aggregate fair value we employed quantitative approach to ass the reporting unit the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using an income approach which is based on estimated discounted future cash flow we made estimate and assumption regarding future cash flow discount rate and long term growth rate to determine the reporting unit estimated fair value the key assumption used were follows expected cash flow underlying the business plan for the period through which took into account estimate of subscriber for tvision service average revenue and content cost per subscriber operating cost and capital expenditure cash flow beyond were projected to grow at long term growth rate estimated at estimating long term growth rate requires significant judgment about future business strategy well micro and macro economic environment that are inherently uncertain we used discount rate of to risk adjust the cash flow projection in determining the estimated fair value the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded it carrying value by approximately of december delay in the national launch of tvision service or cash flow that do not meet our projection could result in goodwill impairment of in the future the carrying value of the goodwill associated with the reporting unit wa million of december of contentswe test our spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology which is an income approach to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition the greenfield methodology value the spectrum license by calculating the cash flow generating potential of hypothetical start up company that go into business with no asset except the asset to be valued in this case spectrum license the value of the spectrum license can be considered equal to the present value of the cash flow of this hypothetical start up company we base the assumption underlying the greenfield methodology on combination of market participant data and our historical result trend and business plan future cash flow in the greenfield methodology are based on estimate and assumption of market participant revenue ebitda margin network build out period and long term growth rate for market participant the cash flow are discounted using weighted average cost of capital the valuation approach utilized to estimate fair value for the purpose of the impairment test of goodwill and spectrum license require the use of assumption and estimate which involve degree of uncertainty if actual result or future expectation are not consistent with the assumption this may result in the recording of significant impairment charge on goodwill or spectrum license the most significant assumption within the valuation model are the discount rate revenue ebitda margin capital expenditure and the long term growth rate see note summary of significant accounting policy and note goodwill spectrum license transaction and other intangible asset of the note to the consolidated financial statement for information regarding our annual impairment test and impairment charge income taxesdeferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on temporary difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when these difference are realized valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we ass whether it is more likely than not that tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merit of the position and adjust the

preparation of financial statement in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle gaap requires our management to make estimate and assumption which affect the financial statement and accompanying note estimate are based on historical experience where applicable and other assumption which our management belief are reasonable under the circumstance these estimate are inherently subject to judgment and actual result could differ from these estimate certain prior year amount have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation see accounting pronouncement adopted during the current year below cash and cash equivalentscash equivalent consist of highly liquid money market fund and treasury security with remaining maturity of three month or le at the date of purchase receivables and allowance for credit lossesaccounts receivable consist primarily of amount currently due from customer other carrier and third party retail channel account receivable not held for sale are reported in the balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge offs and the allowance for credit loss account receivable held for sale are reported at the lower of amortized cost or fair value we have an arrangement to sell the majority of service account receivable on revolving basis which are treated sale of financial asset we offer certain retail customer the option to pay for their device and certain other purchase in installment typically over period of but up to month using an eip eip receivables not held for sale are reported in our consolidated balance sheet at outstanding principal adjusted for any charge offs allowance for credit loss and unamortized discount at the time of an installment sale we impute discount for interest if the eip term exceeds month there is no stated rate of interest on the eip receivables the eip receivables are recorded at their present value which is determined by discounting future cash payment at the imputed interest rate the difference between the recorded amount of the eip receivables and their unpaid principal balance the contractual amount due from the customer result in discount which is allocated to the performance obligation in the arrangement and recorded reduction in transaction price in total service revenue and equipment revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income we determine the imputed discount rate based primarily on current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk on the eip receivables result we do not recognize separate credit loss allowance at the time of issuance the effect of uncertainty about future cash flow resulting from credit risk are included in the initial present value measurement of the receivable the imputed discount on eip receivables is for note to the consolidated financial statementsamortized over the financed installment term using the effective interest method and recognized other revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income subsequent to the initial determination of the imputed discount we ass the need for and if necessary recognize an allowance for credit loss to the extent the amount of estimated probable loss on the gross eip receivable balance exceed the remaining unamortized imputed discount balance total imputed discount and allowance were approximately and of the total amount of gross account receivable including eip receivables at december and respectively the current portion of the eip receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables net and the long term portion of the eip receivables is included in equipment installment plan receivables due after one year net in our consolidated balance sheet we have an arrangement to sell certain eip receivables on revolving basis which are treated sale of financial asset we maintain an allowance for credit loss and determine it appropriateness through an established process that ass the loss inherent in our receivables portfolio we develop and document our allowance methodology at the portfolio segment level account receivable portfolio and eip receivable portfolio segment while we attribute portion of the allowance to our respective account receivable and eip portfolio segment the entire allowance is available to absorb credit loss inherent in the total receivables portfolio our process involves procedure to appropriately consider the unique risk characteristic of our account receivable and eip receivable portfolio segment for each portfolio segment loss are estimated collectively for group of receivables with similar characteristic our allowance level are influenced by receivable volume receivable delinquency status historical loss experience and other condition influencing loss expectation such macro economic condition inventoriesinventories consist primarily of wireless device and accessory which are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost is determined using standard cost which approximates average cost shipping and handling cost paid to wireless device and accessory vendor and cost to refurbish used device recovered through our device upgrade program are included in the standard cost of inventory net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business le reasonably predictable cost of completion disposal and transportation we record inventory write down to net realizable value for obsolete and slow moving item based on inventory turnover trend and historical experience long lived assetslong lived asset include asset that do not have indefinite life such property and equipment and other intangible asset all of our long lived asset are located in the including puerto rico and the virgin island we ass potential impairment to our long lived asset when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable if any indicator of impairment are present we test recoverability the carrying value of long lived asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flow expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group if the undiscounted cash flow do not exceed the asset or asset group carrying amount then an impairment loss is recorded measured the amount by which the carrying amount of long lived asset or asset group exceeds it fair value property and equipmentproperty and equipment consists of building and equipment wireless communication system leasehold improvement capitalized software leased wireless device and construction in progress building and equipment include certain network server equipment wireless communication system include asset to operate our wireless network and it data center including tower asset and leasehold improvement and asset related to the liability for the retirement of long lived asset leasehold improvement include asset improvement other than those related to the wireless network property and equipment are recorded at cost le accumulated depreciation and impairment if any in property and equipment net on our consolidated balance sheet we generally depreciate property and equipment over the period the property and equipment provide economic benefit depreciable life study are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable life for certain category of property and equipment these study take into account actual usage physical wear for note to the consolidated financial statementsand tear replacement history and assumption about technology evolution when these factor indicate the useful life of an asset is different from the previous assessment the remaining book value is depreciated prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life leasehold improvement are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful life or the related lease term jump on demand allows customer to lease device over period of up to month and upgrade it for new device up to one time per month to date all of our leased device were classified operating lease at operating lease inception leased wireless device are transferred from inventory to property and equipment leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected loss revenue associated with the leased wireless device net of incentive are generally recognized over the lease term upon device upgrade or at lease end customer must return or purchase their device returned device transferred from property and equipment net are recorded inventory and are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value with any write down recognized cost of equipment sale in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income cost of major replacement and improvement are capitalized repair and maintenance expenditure which do not enhance or extend the asset useful life are charged to operating expense incurred construction cost labor and overhead incurred in the expansion or enhancement of our wireless network are capitalized capitalization commences with pre construction period administrative and technical activity which includes obtaining lease zoning approval and building permit and cease at the point at which the asset is ready for it intended use we capitalize interest associated with the acquisition or construction of certain property and equipment capitalized interest is reported reduction in interest expense and depreciated over the useful life of the related asset we record an asset retirement obligation for the fair value of legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived asset and corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset in the period in which the obligation is incurred in period subsequent to initial measurement we recognize change in the liability resulting from the passage of time and revision to either the timing or the amount of the original estimate over time the liability is accreted to it present value and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset our obligation relate primarily to certain legal obligation to remediate leased property on which our network infrastructure and administrative asset are located we capitalize certain cost incurred in connection with developing or acquiring internal use software capitalization of software cost commences once the final selection of the specific software solution ha been made and management authorizes and commits to funding the software project capitalized software cost are included in property and equipment net in our consolidated balance sheet and are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset cost incurred during the preliminary project stage well maintenance and training cost are expensed incurred other intangible assetsintangible asset that do not have indefinite useful life are amortized over their estimated useful life customer list are amortized using the sum of the year digit method over the expected period in which the relationship is expected to contribute to future cash flow the remaining finite lived intangible asset are amortized using the straight line method goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assetsgoodwillgoodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net asset acquired in business combination goodwill is allocated to our two reporting unit wireless and spectrum licensesspectrum license are carried at cost incurred to acquire the spectrum license and the cost to prepare the spectrum license for their intended use such cost to clear acquired spectrum license the federal communication commission fcc issue spectrum license which provide with the exclusive right to utilize designated radio frequency spectrum within specific geographic service area to provide wireless communication service while spectrum license are issued for fixed period of time typically for up to fifteen year the fcc ha granted license renewal routinely and at nominal cost the spectrum license held by expire at various date we believe we will be able to meet all requirement necessary to secure renewal of our spectrum license at nominal cost moreover we determined there are currently no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factor that limit the useful life of our spectrum license therefore we determined the spectrum license should be treated indefinite lived intangible asset for note to the consolidated financial statementsat time we enter into agreement to sell or exchange spectrum license upon entering into the arrangement if the transaction ha been deemed to have commercial substance spectrum license are reviewed for impairment and transferred at their carrying value net of any impairment to asset held for sale included in other current asset in our consolidated balance sheet until approval and completion of the exchange or sale upon closing of the transaction spectrum license acquired part of an exchange of nonmonetary asset are valued at fair value and the difference between the fair value of the spectrum license obtained book value of the spectrum license transferred and cash paid if any is recognized gain and included in gain on disposal of spectrum license in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income our fair value estimate of spectrum license are based on information for which there is little or no observable market data if the transaction lack commercial substance or the fair value is not measurable the acquired spectrum license are recorded at the book value of the asset transferred or exchanged impairmentwe ass the carrying value of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset such our spectrum license for potential impairment annually of december or more frequently if event or change in circumstance indicate such asset might be impaired when assessing goodwill for impairment we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment for reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary if we do not perform qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the two reporting unit wireless and is le than it carrying amount we perform quantitative test we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit fair value however the loss recognized would not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit we test our spectrum license for impairment on an aggregate basis consistent with our management of the overall business at national level we may elect to first perform qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an intangible asset is le than it carrying value if we do not perform the qualitative assessment or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is le than it carrying amount we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset if the estimated fair value of the spectrum license is lower than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference we estimate fair value using the greenfield methodology which is an income approach based on discounted cash flow associated with the intangible asset to estimate the price at which an orderly transaction to sell the asset would take place between market participant at the measurement date under current market condition guarantee liabilitieswe offer device trade in program just upgrade my phone jump which provides eligible customer specified price trade in right to upgrade their device upon enrollment participating customer must finance the purchase of device on an eip and have qualifying mobile monthly wireless service plan which is treated an arrangement with multiple performance obligation when entered into at or near the same time upon qualifying jump program upgrade the customer remaining eip balance is settled provided they trade in their eligible used device in good working condition and purchase new device from on new eip for customer who enroll in jump we recognize liability and reduce revenue for the portion of revenue which represents the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the guarantee liability is valued based on various economic and customer behavioral assumption which requires judgment including estimating the customer remaining eip balance at trade in the expected fair value of the used device at trade in and the probability and timing of trade in when customer upgrade their device the difference between the eip balance credit to the customer and the fair value of the returned device is recorded against the guarantee liability all assumption are reviewed periodically fair value measurementswe carry certain asset and liability at fair value fair value is defined an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date the three tier hierarchy for input used in measuring fair value which prioritizes the input based on the observability of the measurement date is follows for note to the consolidated financial statementslevel quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable input other than the quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability andlevel unobservable input for which there is little or no market data which require to develop assumption of what market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability asset and liability are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of asset and liability being measured within the fair value hierarchy the carrying value of cash and cash equivalent short term investment account receivable account receivable from affiliate and account payable approximate fair value due to the short term maturity of these instrument the carrying value of eip receivables approximate fair value the receivables are recorded at their present value net of unamortized discount and allowance for credit loss there were no financial instrument with carrying value materially different from their fair value based on quoted market price or rate for the same or similar instrument or internal valuation model derivative financial instrumentsderivative financial instrument are recognized either asset or liability and are measured at fair value we do not use derivative for trading or speculative purpose for derivative instrument designated cash flow hedge associated with forecasted debt issuance change in fair value are reported component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until reclassified into interest expense in the same period the hedged transaction affect earnings generally over the life of the related debt unrealized gain on derivative designated cash flow hedge are recorded at fair value asset and unrealized loss on derivative designated cash flow hedge are recorded at fair value liability revenue recognition effective january we primarily generate our revenue from providing wireless service to customer and selling or leasing device and accessory our contract with customer may involve multiple performance obligation which include wireless service wireless device or combination thereof and we allocate the transaction price between each performance obligation based on it relative standalone selling price significant judgmentsthe most significant judgment affecting the amount and timing of revenue from contract with our customer include the following item revenue for service contract that we ass are not probable of collection is not recognized until the contract is completed or terminated and cash is received collectibility is re assessed when there is significant change in fact or circumstance our assessment of collectibility considers whether we may limit our exposure to credit risk through our right to stop transferring additional service in the event the customer is delinquent well certain contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see receivables and allowance for credit loss above for more discussion on how we ass credit risk promotional eip bill credit offered to customer on an equipment sale that are paid over time and are contingent on the customer maintaining service contract may result in an extended service contract based on whether substantive penalty is deemed to exist determining whether contingent eip bill credit result in substantive termination penalty may require significant judgment the identification of distinct performance obligation within our service plan may require significant judgment revenue is recorded net of cost paid to another party for performance obligation where we arrange for the other party to transfer good or service to the customer when we are acting an agent for example performance obligation relating to service provided by third party content provider where we neither control right to the content provider service nor control the underlying service itself are presented net because we are acting an agent the determination of whether we control the underlying service or right to the service prior to our transfer to the customer requires at time significant judgment for note to the consolidated financial statement for transaction where we recognize significant financing component judgment is required to determine the discount rate for eip sale the discount rate used to adjust the transaction price primarily reflects current market interest rate and the estimated credit risk of the customer customer credit behavior is inherently uncertain see receivables and allowance for credit loss above for more discussion on how we ass credit risk our product are generally sold with right of return which is accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize device return level are estimated based on the expected value method there are large number of contract with similar characteristic and the outcome of each contract is independent of the others historical return rate experience is significant input to our expected value methodology sale of equipment to indirect dealer who have been identified our customer referred to the sell in model often include credit subsequently paid to the dealer reimbursement for any discount promotion offered to the end consumer these credit payment to customer are accounted for variable consideration when estimating the amount of revenue to recognize from the sale of equipment to indirect dealer and are estimated based on historical experience and other factor such expected promotional activity the determination of the standalone selling price for contract that involve more than one performance obligation may require significant judgment such when the selling price of good or service is not readily observable for capitalized contract cost determining the amortization period over which such cost are recognized well assessing the indicator of impairment may require significant judgment wireless service revenuewe generate our wireless service revenue from providing access to and usage of our wireless communication network service revenue also include revenue earned for providing value added service to customer such handset insurance service service contract are billed monthly either in advance or arrears or are prepaid generally service revenue is recognized we satisfy our performance obligation to transfer service to our customer we typically satisfy our stand ready performance obligation including unlimited wireless service evenly over the contract term for usage based and prepaid wireless service we satisfy our performance obligation when service are rendered consideration payable to customer is treated reduction of the total transaction price unless the payment is in exchange for distinct good or service such certain commission paid to dealer federal universal service fund usf and other fee are assessed by various governmental authority in connection with the service we provide to our customer and are included in cost of service when we separately bill and collect these regulatory fee from customer they are recorded gross in total service revenue in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended december and we recorded approximately million million and million respectively of usf fee on gross basis we have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the measurement of the transaction price all tax assessed by governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transaction and collected by from customer sale use value added and some excise tax equipment revenueswe generate equipment revenue from the sale or lease of mobile communication device and accessory for performance obligation related to equipment contract we typically transfer control at point in time when the device or accessory is delivered to and accepted by the customer or dealer we have elected to account for shipping and handling activity that occur after control of the related good transfer fulfillment activity instead of assessing such activity performance obligation we estimate variable consideration device return or certain payment to indirect dealer primarily based on historical experience equipment sale not probable of collection are generally recorded payment are received our assessment of collectibility considers contract term such down payment that reduce our exposure to credit risk we offer certain customer the option to pay for device and accessory in installment using an eip generally we recognize reduction of the total transaction price the effect of financing component in contract where customer purchase their device and accessory on an eip with term of more than one year including those financing component that are not considered to be significant to the contract however we have elected the practical expedient to not recognize the effect of for note to the consolidated financial statementssignificant financing component for contract where we expect at contract inception that the period between the transfer of performance obligation to customer and the customer payment for that performance obligation will be one year or le in addition for customer who enroll in our jump program we recognize liability based on the estimated fair value of the specified price trade in right guarantee the fair value of the guarantee is deducted from the transaction price and the remaining transaction price is allocated to other element of the contract including service and equipment performance obligation see guarantee liability above for further information jump on demand allows customer to lease device over period of up to month and upgrade it for new device up to one time per month to date all of our leased wireless device are accounted for operating lease and estimated contract consideration is allocated between lease element and non lease element such service and equipment performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation in the contract lease revenue are recorded equipment revenue and recognized earned on straight line basis over the lease term lease revenue on contract not probable of collection are limited to the amount of payment received see property and equipment above for further information contract balancesgenerally our device and service plan are available at standard price which are maintained on price list and published on our website and or within our retail store for contract that involve more than one product or service that are identified separate performance obligation the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligation based on their relative standalone selling price the standalone selling price is the price at which we would sell the good or service separately to customer and is most commonly evidenced by the price at which we sell that good or service separately in similar circumstance and to similar customer contract asset is recorded when revenue is recognized in advance of our right to receive consideration we must perform additional service in order to receive consideration amount are recorded receivables when our right to consideration is unconditional when consideration is received or we have an unconditional right to consideration in advance of delivery of good or service contract liability is recorded the transaction price can include non refundable upfront fee which are allocated to the identifiable performance obligation contract asset are included in other current asset and other asset and contract liability are included in deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet contract modificationsour service contract allow customer to frequently modify their contract without incurring penalty in many case each time contract is modified we evaluate the change in scope or price of the contract to determine if the modification should be treated separate contract if there is termination of the existing contract and creation of new contract or if the modification should be considered change associated with the existing contract we typically do not have significant impact from contract modification contract costswe incur certain incremental cost to obtain contract that we expect to recover such sale commission we record an asset when these incremental cost to obtain contract are incurred and amortize them on systematic basis that is consistent with the transfer to the customer of the good or service to which the asset relates we amortize deferred cost incurred to obtain service contract on straight line basis over the term of the initial contract and anticipated renewal contract to which the cost relate currently month for postpaid service contract however we have elected the practical expedient permitting expensing of cost to obtain contract when the expected amortization period is one year or le for prepaid service contract incremental cost to obtain equipment contract commission paid on device and accessory sale are recognized when the equipment is transferred to the customer for note to the consolidated financial statementssee note summary of significant accounting policy included in our annual report on form for the year ended december for more discussion regarding the accounting policy that governed revenue recognition prior to january advertising expensewe expense the cost of advertising and other promotional expenditure to market our service and product incurred for the year ended december and advertising expense included in selling general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income were billion billion and billion respectively income taxesdeferred tax asset and liability are recognized based on temporary difference between the financial statement and tax base of asset and liability using enacted tax rate expected to be in effect when these difference are realized valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of deferred tax asset will not be realized the ultimate realization of deferred tax asset depends on the ability to generate sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction within the carryforward period available we account for uncertainty in income tax recognized in the financial statement in accordance with the accounting guidance for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax position taken or expected to be taken in tax return we ass whether it is more likely than not that tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merit of the position and adjust the unrecognized tax benefit in light of change in fact and circumstance such change in tax law interaction with taxing authority and development in case law other comprehensive income loss other comprehensive income loss consists of adjustment net of tax related to unrealized gain loss on cash flow hedge and available for sale security this is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss separate component of stockholder equity until realized in earnings stock based compensationstock based compensation cost for stock award which include restricted stock unit rsus and performance based restricted stock unit prsus is measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized expense net of expected forfeiture over the related service period the fair value of stock award is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant rsus are recognized expense using the straight line method prsus are recognized expense following graded vesting schedule with their performance re assessed and updated on quarterly basis or more frequently change in fact and circumstance warrant earnings per sharebasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholder by the weighted average number of common share outstanding for the period diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive common share outstanding during the period potentially dilutive common share consist of outstanding stock option rsus and prsus calculated using the treasury stock method and prior to the conversion of our preferred stock in december potentially dilutive common share included mandatory convertible preferred stock calculated using the if converted method see note earnings per share for further information variable interest entitiesvies are entity that lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance it activity without additional subordinated financial support from other party have equity investor that do not have the ability to make significant decision relating to the entity operation through voting right do not have the obligation to absorb the expected loss or do not have the right to receive the residual return of the entity the most common type of vie is special purpose entity spe spes are commonly used in securitization transaction in order to isolate certain asset and distribute the cash flow from those asset to investor spes are generally structured to insulate investor from claim on the spe asset by creditor of other entity including the creditor of the seller of the asset for note to the consolidated financial statementsthe primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the asset and liability of the vie the primary beneficiary is the party which ha both the power to direct the activity of an entity that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and through it interest in the vie the obligation to absorb loss or the right to receive benefit from the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie we consolidate vies when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or when the vie can not be deconsolidated in assessing which party is the primary beneficiary all the fact and circumstance are considered including each party role in establishing the vie and it ongoing right and responsibility this assessment includes first identifying the activity that most significantly impact the vie economic performance and second identifying which party if any ha power over those activity in general the party that make the most significant decision affecting the vie such asset manager and servicers or have the right to unilaterally remove those decision maker are deemed to have the power to direct the activity of vie accounting pronouncement adopted during the current yearleasesin february the financial accounting standard board fasb issued asu lease topic and ha since modified the standard with several asus collectively the new lease standard the new lease standard wa effective for and we adopted the standard on january we adopted the standard by recognizing and measuring lease at the adoption date with cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date of initial application and result not restate the prior period presented in the consolidated financial statement the new lease standard provides for number of optional practical expedient in transition we did not elect the package of practical expedient and result reassessed under the new lease standard our prior accounting conclusion about lease identification lease classification and initial direct cost we elected to use hindsight for determining the reasonably certain lease term we did not elect the practical expedient pertaining to land easement it is not applicable to the new lease standard provides practical expedient and policy election for an entity ongoing accounting generally we elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non lease component in arrangement whereby we are the lessee for arrangement in which we are the lessor of wireless device we did not elect this practical expedient we did not elect the short term lease recognition exemption which includes the recognition of right of use asset and lease liability for existing short term lease at transition we have also applied this election to all active lease at transition the most significant judgment and impact upon adoption of the standard include the following in evaluating contract to determine if they qualify lease we consider factor such if we have obtained or transferred substantially all of the right to the underlying asset through exclusivity if we can or if we have transferred the ability to direct the use of the asset by making decision about how and for what purpose the asset will be used and if the lessor ha substantive substitution right we recognized right of use asset and operating lease liability for operating lease that have not previously been recorded the lease liability for operating lease is based on the net present value of future minimum lease payment the right of use asset for operating lease is based on the lease liability adjusted for the reclassification of certain balance sheet amount such prepaid rent and deferred rent which we remeasured at adoption due to the application of hindsight to our lease term estimate deferred and prepaid rent are no longer presented separately capital lease asset previously included within property and equipment net were reclassified to financing lease right of use asset and capital lease liability previously included in short term debt and long term debt were reclassified to financing lease liability in our consolidated balance sheet certain line item in the consolidated statement of cash flow and the supplemental disclosure of cash flow information have been renamed to align with the new terminology presented in the new lease standard repayment of capital lease obligation is now presented repayment of financing lease obligation and asset acquired under capital lease obligation is now presented financing lease right of use asset obtained in exchange for lease obligation in the operating activity section of the consolidated statement of cash flow we have added operating lease right of use asset and short and long term operating lease liability which represent the change for note to the consolidated financial statementsin the operating lease asset and liability respectively additionally in the supplemental disclosure of cash flow information section of the consolidated statement of cash flow we have added operating lease payment and in the noncash investing and financing activity section we have added operating lease right of use asset obtained in exchange for lease obligation in determining the discount rate used to measure the right of use asset and lease liability we use rate implicit in the lease or if not readily available we use our incremental borrowing rate our incremental borrowing rate is based on an estimated secured rate comprised of risk free libor rate plus credit spread secured by our asset determining credit spread secured by our asset may require significant judgment certain of our lease agreement include rental payment based on change in the consumer price index cpi lease liability are not remeasured result of change in the cpi instead change in the cpi are treated variable lease payment and are excluded from the measurement of the right of use asset and lease liability these payment are recognized in the period in which the related obligation wa incurred our lease agreement do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenant we elected the use of hindsight whereby we applied current lease term assumption that are applied to new lease in determining the expected lease term period for all cell site upon adoption of the new lease standard and application of hindsight our expected lease term ha shortened to reflect payment due for the initial non cancelable lease term only this assessment corresponds to our lease term assessment for new lease and aligns with the payment that have been disclosed lease commitment in prior year result the average remaining lease term for cell site ha decreased from approximately nine to five year based on lease contract in effect at transition on january the aggregate impact of using hindsight is an estimated decrease in total operating expense of million in fiscal year we were also required to reassess the previously failed sale leasebacks of certain mobile owned wireless communication tower site and determine whether the transfer of the asset to the tower operator under the arrangement met the transfer of control criterion in the revenue standard and whether sale should be recognized determining whether the transfer of control criterion ha been met requires significant judgement we concluded that sale ha not occurred for the tower site transferred to crown castle international corp cci pursuant to master prepaid lease arrangement therefore these site will continue to be accounted for failed sale leasebacks we concluded that sale should be recognized for the tower site transferred to cci pursuant to the sale of subsidiary and for the tower site transferred to phoenix tower international pti upon adoption on january we derecognized our existing long term financial obligation and the tower related property and equipment associated with these previously failed sale leaseback tower site and recognized lease liability and right of use asset for the leaseback of the tower site the impact from the change in accounting conclusion are primarily decrease in other revenue of million and decrease in interest expense of million in fiscal year rental revenue and expense associated with co location tower site are presented on net basis under the new lease standard these revenue and expense were presented on gross basis under the former lease standard for note to the consolidated financial statementsincluding the impact from change in the accounting conclusion on the previously failed sale leaseback tower site the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard on january is follows january in million beginning balancecumulative effect adjustmentbeginning balance adjustedassetsother current asset property and equipment operating lease right of use asset financing lease right of use asset other intangible asset other liability and stockholder equityaccounts payable and accrued other current short term and long term tower deferred tax deferred rent short term and long term operating lease liability short term and long term financing lease liability other long term accumulated deficit including the impact from the change in the accounting conclusion on the previously failed sale leaseback tower site and the change in presentation on the income statement of the tower site for which sale did not occur the cumulative effect of initially applying the new lease standard for the year ended december are estimated follows the aggregate impact is decrease in other revenue of million decrease in total operating expense of million decrease in interest expense of million and an increase to net income of million the impact on our consolidated statement of cash flow is decrease in net cash provided by operating activity of million and decrease in net cash used in financing activity of million for arrangement where we are the lessor including arrangement to lease device to our service customer the adoption of the new lease standard did not have material impact on our financial statement these lease are classified operating lease device lease payment are presented equipment revenue and recognized earned on straight line basis over the lease term recognition of equipment revenue on lease contract that are determined to not be probable of collection is limited to the amount of payment received we have made an accounting policy election to exclude from the consideration in the contract all tax assessed by governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transaction and collected by from customer sale use value added and some excise tax at operating lease inception leased wireless device are transferred from inventory to property and equipment net leased wireless device are depreciated to their estimated residual value over the period expected to provide utility to which is generally shorter than the lease term and considers expected loss returned device transferred from property and equipment net are recorded

standard the new credit loss standard requires financial asset or group of financial asset measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit loss is based on relevant information about past event including historical experience current condition and reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new credit loss standard will become effective for beginning on january and requires cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated deficit of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective that is modified retrospective approach we will adopt the new credit loss standard on january and plan to recognize lifetime expected credit loss at the inception of our credit risk exposure whereas we currently recognize credit loss only when it is probable that they have been incurred we will also recognize expected credit loss on our eip receivables excluding consideration of any unamortized discount on those receivables resulting from the imputation of interest we currently offset our estimate of incurred loss on our eip receivables by the amount of the related unamortized discount on those receivables we have developed an expected credit loss model and are refining the input including the forward looking loss indicator the estimated impact of the new credit loss standard on our receivables portfolio of december would be an increase to our allowance for credit loss of million to million decrease to our net deferred tax
