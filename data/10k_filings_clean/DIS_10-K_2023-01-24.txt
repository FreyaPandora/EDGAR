new employment agreement with mr iger chief executive officer with an end date of december in june the board agreed to extend mr chapek employment agreement based on mr chapek work navigating the company through the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic and growing the company streaming business the board continued to spend significant time discussing the leadership of the company in the month that followed and determined that mr chapek wa no longer the right person to serve in the ceo role the significant development and change in the broader macroeconomic environment over this period informed how the board viewed the appropriate leader in light of the rapidly evolving industry and market dynamic the board therefore concluded that disney embarks on an increasingly complex period of industry transformation mr iger is best situated to lead the company while an appropriate longer term successor is identified on november after fiscal the board decided to exercise it right to terminate mr chapek employment without cause in connection with this termination in the event that mr chapek successfully completes all of the term of his post employment consulting agreement and

the filing of this report the property ha not been sold the treatment of the equity award held by mr chapek and mr morrell at their respective termination date under their employment agreement is described below in the section titled executive compensation compensation table termination pursuant to company termination right other than for cause or by executive for good reason it is the standard practice of the compensation committee to only approve termination payment for senior executive within the obligation of the company plan and current employment agreement the committee approved the termination payment and condition for mr morrell due to unique factor specific to his situation that involved an international move for mr morrell and his family this decision wa made in the best interest of the company and we believe will mitigate further disruption to the company the termination provision included in our executive officer employment agreement serve variety of purpose including providing the benefit of equity incentive plan to the executive and the executive family in case of death or disability defining when the executive may be terminated with cause and receive no further compensation and clearly defining right in the event of termination in other circumstance the availability nature and amount of compensation on termination differ depending on whether employment terminates because of death or disability the company termination of the executive pursuant to the company termination right or the executive decision to terminate because of action the company take or fails to take the company termination of the executive for cause or expiration of an employment agreement retirement or other voluntary termination the compensation that each of our neos may receive under each of these termination circumstance is described below it is important to note that the amount of compensation set forth in the table below are based on the specific assumption noted and do not predict the actual compensation that our neos would receive actual compensation received would be function of number of factor that are unknowable at this time including the date of the executive termination of employment the executive base salary at the time of termination the executive age and service with the company at the time of termination and because many element of the compensation are performance based pursuant to the company compensation philosophy described in executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis above the future performance of the company moreover the option and restricted stock unit acceleration amount in case of termination without cause or by the executive for good reason assume that these award immediately accelerate which is not the case in the absence of change in control rather option and unit continue to vest over time and in most case are subject to the same performance measure that apply if there had been no termination the performance measure do not apply to vesting of restricted stock unit award when termination is due to death or disability and the test to assure deductibility under section doe not apply if it is not necessary to preserve deductibility in each of the circumstance described below our neos are eligible to receive earned unpaid salary through the date of termination and benefit that are unconditionally accrued of the date of termination pursuant to policy applicable to all employee this includes the deferred compensation and earnings on these deferred amount described under the fiscal non qualified deferred compensation table this earned compensation is not described or quantified below because these amount represent earned vested benefit that are not contingent on the

accrued benefit include the pension benefit described under executive compensation compensation table pension benefit which become payable to all participant who have reached retirement age because they have reached early retirement or retirement age under the plan mr chapek mccarthy and mr richardson would have been eligible to receive these benefit if their employment had terminated at the end of fiscal because the pension benefit do not differ from those described under executive compensation compensation table pension benefit except in way that are equally applicable to all salaried employee the nature and amount of their pension benefit are not described or quantified below death and disability the employment agreement of each neo provides for payment of any unpaid bonus for any fiscal year that had been completed at the time of the executive death or termination of employment due to disability the amount of the bonus will be determined by the compensation committee using the same criterion used for determining bonus if the executive remained employed in addition to the compensation and right in employment agreement the stock incentive plan and award agreement thereunder

measurement ha not been made at the time of death or disability all restricted stock unit awarded to the participant under the stock incentive plan will to the extent the unit had not previously been forfeited fully vest and become payable upon the death or disability of the participant if performance measurement ha been made at the time of death or disability with respect to restricted stock unit the restricted stock unit will vest and accelerate based on the performance measurement the following table set forth the value of the estimated payment and benefit each of our neos would have received under our compensation plan and their employment agreement if their employment had terminated at the close of business on the last day of fiscal result of death or disability the value of option acceleration is equal to the difference between the closing market price of share of the company common stock on september the last trading day in fiscal and the weighted average exercise price of option with an exercise price le than the market price time the number of share subject to such option that would accelerate result of termination the value of restricted stock unit acceleration is

the committee also understands that executive with the background needed to manage company such have career option with compensation opportunity that normally exceed those available in most other
