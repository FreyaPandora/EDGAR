various industry economic regulatory and other risk and uncertainty our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and prospect could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factor and by additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial risk of declining gross margin in the pbm retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy industry the pbm industry ha been experiencing margin pressure result of competitive pressure and increased client demand for lower price enhanced service offering and or higher service level in that regard we maintain contractual relationship with generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturer that provide for purchase discount and or rebate on drug dispensed by pharmacy in our retail network and by our mail order pharmacy all or portion of which may be passed on to client manufacturer rebate often depend on pbm ability to meet contractual market share or other requirement including in some case the placement of manufacturer product on the pbm formulary if we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturer or if the discount or rebate provided by pharmaceutical manufacturer decline our business and financial result could be adversely affected further competitive pressure in the pbm industry have resulted in our client sharing in larger portion of rebate and or discount received from pharmaceutical manufacturer market dynamic and regulatory change have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsor pricing that includes the use of retail differential or spread which could negatively impact our future profitability further change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to patent term extension purchase discount and rebate arrangement with pharmaceutical manufacturer or to formulary management or other pbm service could also reduce the discount or rebate we receive in addition change in federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to claim processing and billing including our ability to collect transmission fee could adversely impact our profitability both our retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy business have also been affected by the margin pressure described above including client demand for lower price generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition competition increase in the market in which we operate significant increase in general pricing pressure could occur and this could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive finally the margin of our ltc business are further affected by the increased effort of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangement these action could also adversely affect the margin of our ltc business effort to reduce reimbursement level and alter health care financing practice the continued effort of health maintenance organization managed care organization pbms government entity and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceutical which normally yield higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drug ha resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payment to retail ltc and mail order pharmacy for generic drug causing reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability ha been mitigated by our effort to negotiate reduced acquisition cost of generic pharmaceutical with manufacturer however in recent year there ha been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factor may enhance the ability of manufacturer to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceutical and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition cost any inability to offset increased cost or to modify our activity to lessen the impact could have significant adverse effect on our result of operation in addition during the past several year the united state health care industry ha been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audit at both the federal and state level effort to control health care cost including prescription drug cost are continuing at the federal and state government level changing political economic and regulatory influence may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practice for example we anticipate that federal and state government will continue to review and ass alternative health care delivery system payment methodology and operational requirement for health care provider including ltc facility and pharmacy change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward program offering lower reimbursement rate could negatively impact our profitability aca made several significant change to medicaid rebate and to reimbursement one of these change wa to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price pricing element

pbm industry express script optumrx catamaran prime therapeutic medimpact and humana include large national pbm company pbms owned by large national health plan and smaller standalone pbms competition may also come from other source in the future in addition change in the overall composition of our pharmacy network or reduced pharmacy access under our network could adversely affect our claim volume and or our competitiveness generally competitor in each of our business area may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to

ability to secure suitable store location under acceptable term and our ability to execute sale leaseback transaction under acceptable term these change in condition could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial result the possibility of client loss and or the failure to win new business our pbm business generates net revenue primarily by contracting with client to provide prescription drug and related health care service to plan member pbm client contract often have term of approximately three year in duration so approximately one third of pbm client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some case however pbm client may negotiate shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of contract in addition the reputational impact of service related incident could negatively affect our ability to grow and retain our client base further the pbm industry ha been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm client is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or portion of the acquired business these circumstance either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial result therefore we continually face challenge in competing for new pbm business and or renewing our existing pbm business there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on term favorable to the present term additionally with respect to our ltc pharmacy business reimbursement under medicare part well reimbursement from certain private third party payors is determined pursuant to agreement that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representative likewise reimbursement from skilled nursing facility for prescription we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreement with those skilled nursing facility the termination of these agreement generally cause our ability to provide service to any of the resident of that facility to cease resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those resident risk related to the frequency and rate of the introduction of generic drug and brand name prescription product the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug product utilization trend are affected by among other factor the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceutical well lower priced generic alternative to existing brand name product accordingly our business could be impacted by slowdown in the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceutical and or generic alternative the sale of which normally yield higher gross profit margin than brand name equivalent the failure or disruption of our information technology system our information security system and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information many aspect of our operation are dependent on our information system and the information collected

on the secure transmission of confidential information over public network our information system are subject to damage or interruption from power outage computer and telecommunication failure computer virus security breach including credit card information breach vandalism catastrophic event and human error although we deploy layered approach to address information security threat and vulnerability including one from cybersecurity standpoint designed to protect confidential information against data security breach compromise of our information security control or of those business with we interact which result in confidential information being accessed obtained damaged or used by unauthorized or improper person could harm our reputation and expose to regulatory action and claim from customer and client financial institution payment card association and other person any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation moreover data security breach could require that we expend significant resource related to our information system and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duty if our information system are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claim adjudication platform we may incur substantial cost to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruption or delay in our ability to perform essential function and implement new and innovative service in addition compliance with change in privacy and information security law and standard may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational process risk relating to the market availability supplier and safety profile of prescription drug that we purchase and sell we dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug from our retail ltc and mail order pharmacy and through our pbm network of retail pharmacy when increased safety risk profile or manufacturing or other supply issue of specific drug or class of drug occur or drug become subject to greater restriction controlled substance physician may cease writing prescription for these drug or the utilization of these drug may be otherwise reduced additionally adverse publicity regarding drug with higher safety risk profile may result in reduced consumer demand for such drug on occasion product are withdrawn by their manufacturer or transition to over the counter product which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda ruling could restrict the supply or increase the cost of product sold to our customer our volume net revenue profitability and cash flow may decline result of such regulatory ruling or market change we acquire substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier our agreement with these supplier are often short term and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may limit our ability to provide service for competing drug during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channel other than certain of these agreement also allow pricing and other term to be adjusted periodically for changing market condition or required service level termination or modification to any of these relationship could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation moreover many product distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredient that are susceptible to supply shortage in the event any product we distribute are in limited supply for significant period of time our financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected regulatory and business change relating to our participation in medicare part medicare part ha resulted in increased utilization and put pressure on pharmacy gross margin rate due to regulatory and competitive pressure further result of aca and change to the retiree drug subsidy rule our pbm client could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible member to the extent this occurs the adverse effect of increasing customer migration into medicare part may outweigh the benefit we realize from growth of our medicare part business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part exceed management expectation or prevent effective program implementation or administration if change to the regulation regarding how drug cost are reported for medicare part are implemented in manner that impact the profitability of our medicare part business if change to the regulation impact our ability to retain fee from third party including network pharmacy if the government alters medicare program requirement or reduces funding because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayer of medicare part or for other reason if we fail to design and maintain program that are attractive to medicare participant if cm imposes restriction on our medicare part business result of audit or other regulatory action if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measure sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restriction that may be imposed by cm or if we are not successful in retaining enrollee or winning contract renewal or new contract under medicare part competitive bidding process our medicare part service and the ability to expand our medicare part service could be negatively impacted reform of the united state health care system congressional effort to reform the united state health care system came to fruition in with the passage of aca which resulted in significant structural change to the health insurance system see business government regulation although many of the change enacted by aca have been implemented some significant provision have not yet been finalized nondiscrimination in health program and activity excise tax on high cost employer sponsored health coverage therefore uncertainty remains to the full impact of aca on our business while these provision may not affect our business directly they affect the coverage and plan design that are or will be provided by many of our health plan client result they could indirectly impact our service and business practice we can not predict the effect if any the remaining aca change may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and pharmacy service business and it is possible that other unanticipated legislative or market driven change in the health care system could also occur possible change in industry pricing benchmark and drug pricing generally it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price awp or wholesale acquisition cost wac which are the pricing reference used for many of our pbm and ltc client contract pharmaceutical purchase agreement retail network contract specialty payor agreement and other contract with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payment future change to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmark used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health program and or other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid program the reimbursement we receive from pbm client and other payors and or our ability to negotiate rebate and or discount with pharmaceutical manufacturer wholesaler pbms and retail pharmacy additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection the effect of these possible change on our business can not be predicted at this time product liability product recall or personal injury issue could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage the product that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition error in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceutical could lead to serious injury or death product liability or injury claim may be asserted against with respect to any of the product or pharmaceutical we sell or service we provide our business involves the provision of professional service including by pharmacist nurse and nurse practitioner that expose to professional liability claim product or other liability issue arise the coverage limit under our insurance program and the indemnification amount available to may not be adequate to protect against claim we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable term in the future damage to our reputation in the event of product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against or product recall could have significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customer and the demand for our product and service including propriety brand the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customer to purchase product in additional category and our proprietary brand failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preference and spending pattern an inability to expand the product being purchased by our client and customer or the failure or inability to obtain or offer particular category of product could negatively affect our relationship with our client and customer and the demand for our product and service we offer our retail customer proprietary brand product that are available exclusively at our retail store and through our online retail site the sale of proprietary product subject to unique risk including potential product liability risk and mandatory or voluntary product recall our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property right and the right of applicable third party and other risk generally encountered by entity that source market and sell private label product any failure to adequately address some or all of these risk could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition additionally an increase in the sale of our proprietary brand may negatively affect our sale of product owned by our supplier which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationship our ability to locate qualified economically stable supplier who satisfy our requirement and to acquire sufficient product in timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other thing that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationship with broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial
