compete with the captive component division of oems aerospace sale our aerospace segment sale were and of our total sale in and our sale to commercial aerospace oems were and of our total sale in and in addition our sale to commercial aftermarket customer of aerospace product and service were and of our total sale in and government sale sale to the government principally by aerospace acting through it various department and agency and through prime contractor amounted to million million and million in and which included sale to the department of defense prime contractor and subcontractor of million million and million in and defense spending decreased in compared to we not expect our overall operating result to be significantly affected by any proposed change in federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government program which impact oems production engineering development program aftermarket spare and repair and overhaul program well our diversified commercial business backlog our total backlog at december and wa million and million we anticipate that approximately million of the backlog will be filled in we believe that backlog is not necessarily reliable indicator of our future sale substantial portion of the order constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer option international operation we are engaged in manufacturing sale service and research and development globally export and non manufactured product are significant to our operation export comprised of our total sale in and in each of and non

building technology performance material and technology safety and productivity solution of total sale export non information related to risk attendant to our foreign operation is included in item risk factor under the caption macroeconomic and industry risk raw material the principal raw material used in our operation are generally readily available although we occasionally experience disruption in raw material supply we experienced no significant problem in the purchase of key raw material or commodity in we are not dependent on any one supplier for material amount of our raw material the cost of certain key raw material including fluorspar copper ethylene and perchloroethylene in performance material and technology and nickel steel titanium and other metal in aerospace are expected to continue to fluctuate we will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increase with formula or long term supply agreement price increase and hedging activity feasible we do not presently anticipate that shortage of raw material will cause any material adverse impact during patent trademark license and distribution right our segment are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patent or any license or distribution right in our judgment our intellectual property right are adequate for the conduct of our business we believe that in the aggregate the right under our patent trademark and license are generally important to our operation we do not consider any individual patent trademark or any licensing or distribution right related to specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business research and development the company principal research and development activity are in the india europe and china research and

million in and environment we are subject to various federal state local and foreign government requirement regarding protection of human health and the environment we believe that general matter our policy practice and procedure are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and of resulting financial liability in connection with our business some risk of environmental damage is however inherent in some of our operation and product it is with other company engaged in similar business we are and have been engaged in the handling manufacture use and disposal of many substance classified hazardous by one or more regulatory agency we believe that general matter our policy practice and procedure are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling manufacture use and disposal of substance are in accord with environmental and safety law and regulation it is also possible that future knowledge or other development such improved capability to detect substance in the environment or increasingly strict environmental law and standard and enforcement policy could bring question our current or past handling manufacture use or disposal of these substance among other environmental requirement we are subject to the federal superfund and similar state and foreign law and regulation under which we have been designated potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup cost associated with current and former operating site and various hazardous waste site some of which are on the environmental protection agency national priority list although there is possibility that responsible party might have to bear more it proportional share of the cleanup cost if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible party we do not anticipate to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi party situation taken whole we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation regulation or international treaty or accord are reasonably likely to have material effect in the foreseeable future on the company business or market that it serf on it result of operation capital expenditure earnings competitive position or financial standing we will continue to monitor emerging development in this area employee we have approximately

our forward looking statement our forward looking statement are also subject to risk and uncertainty that affect our performance in the near and long term these forward looking statement be considered in light of the information included in this form including in particular the factor discussed these factor may be revised or supplemented in subsequent report on form and risk factor our business operating result cash flow and financial condition are subject to the principal risk and uncertainty set forth below any one of which could cause our actual result to vary materially from recent result or from our anticipated future result macroeconomic and industry risk industry and economic condition may adversely affect the market and operating condition of our customer which in turn can affect demand for our product and service and our result of operation aerospace operating result of aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic condition well change in customer buying pattern of aftermarket part supplier stability factory transition and capacity constraint the operating result of our commercial aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturn in the global demand for air travel which impact new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft order delay in launch schedule for new aircraft the retirement of aircraft and global flying hour which impact air transport regional business and general aviation aircraft utilization rate operating result could also be impacted by change in overall trend related to end market demand for the product portfolio operating result in our defense and space business unit may be affected by the mix of and foreign government appropriation for defense and space program and by compliance risk result may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit part into our global supply chain operating result in our transportation system business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobile and truck equipped with turbochargers regulatory change regarding automobile and truck emission and fuel economy consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket product and delay in launch schedule for new automobile and truck platform home and building technology operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity including retrofit and upgrade lower capital spending and operating expenditure on building project le industrial plant expansion change in the competitive landscape including new market entrant and new technology and fluctuation in inventory level in distribution channel performance material and technology operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in capacity utilization for chemical industrial refining petrochemical and semiconductor plant our customer availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion raw material demand and supply volatility product commoditization and our ability to maximize our facility production capacity and minimize downtime in particular the volatility in oil and natural gas price have and will continue to impact our customer operating level and capital spending and thus demand for our product and service safety and productivity solution operating result may be adversely impacted by downturn in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditure including in the oil and gas industry reduced investment in process automation safety monitoring and plant capacity utilization initiative fluctuation in retail market lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trend related to end market demand change in the competitive landscape including new market entrant and technology that may lead to product commoditization and adverse industry economic condition all of which could result in lower market share reduced selling price and lower margin an increasing percentage of our sale and operation is in non jurisdiction and is subject to the economic political regulatory foreign exchange and other risk of international operation our international operation including export represent more than half of the company sale risk related to international operation include exchange control regulation wage and price control antitrust regulation employment regulation foreign investment law import export and other trade restriction such embargo violation by our employee of anti corruption law despite our effort to mitigate these risk change in regulation regarding transaction with state owned enterprise nationalization of private enterprise act of terrorism and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employee in these region instability and uncertainty arising from the global geopolitical environment including the united kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the european union and the evolving political regulatory and economic landscape following the election and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulation worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product marketing pricing or other strategy for growing our business well our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margin operating outside of the united state also expose to foreign exchange risk which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activity however foreign exchange hedging activity bear financial cost and may not always be available to or be successful in eliminating such volatility finally we generate significant amount of cash outside of the united state that is invested with financial and non financial counterparties while we employ comprehensive control regarding global cash management to guard cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operation and commitment material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose honeywell to financial loss risk related to our defined benefit pension plan may adversely impact our result of operation and cash flow significant change in actual investment return on pension asset discount rate and other factor could adversely affect our result of operation and require cash pension contribution in future period change in discount rate and actual asset return different than our anticipated asset return can result in significant non cash actuarial gain or loss which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and if applicable in any quarter in which an interim measurement is triggered with regard to cash pension contribution funding requirement for our pension plan are largely dependent upon interest rate actual investment return on pension asset and the impact of legislative or regulatory change related to pension funding obligation operational risk raw material price fluctuation the ability of key supplier to meet quality and delivery requirement or catastrophic event can increase the cost of our product and service impact our ability to meet commitment to customer and cause to incur significant liability the cost of raw material is key element in the cost of our product particularly in performance material and technology fluorspar copper ethylene and perchloroethylene and in aerospace nickel steel titanium and other metal our inability to offset material price inflation through increased price to customer formula or long term fixed price contract with supplier productivity action or through commodity hedge could adversely affect our result of operation many major component product equipment item and raw material particularly in aerospace are procured or subcontracted on single or sole source basis although we maintain qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that source of supply for raw material and component are generally adequate it is difficult to predict effect shortage or price increase may have in the future our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirement may be constrained by our supplier inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long lead time product during time of volatile demand our inability to fill our supply need would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligation under commercial and government contract which could in turn result in reduced sale and profit contract penalty or termination and damage to customer relationship we may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisition and divestiture may not occur planned we regularly review our portfolio of business and pursue growth through acquisition and seek to divest non core business we may not be able to complete transaction on favorable term on timely basis or at all and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issue in addition our result of operation and cash flow may be adversely impacted by the failure of acquired business to meet or exceed expected return including risk of impairment ii the failure to integrate multiple acquired business into honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and or to achieve expected synergy iii the inability to dispose of non core asset and business on satisfactory term and condition and iv the discovery of unanticipated liability labor relation difficulty or other problem in acquired business for which we lack contractual protection insurance or indemnity or with regard to divested business claim by purchaser to whom we have provided contractual indemnification our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technology and introduce new product that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive market with acceptable margin our future growth rate depends upon number of factor including our ability to identify emerging technological trend in our target end market ii develop and maintain competitive product iii defend our market share against an ever expanding number of competitor including many new and non traditional competitor iv enhance our product by adding innovative feature that differentiate our product from those of our competitor and prevent commoditization of our product develop manufacture and bring compelling new product to market quickly and cost effectively and vi attract develop and retain individual with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customer need to develop new technology and introduce new product the failure of our technology or product to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offering by our competitor could significantly reduce our revenue and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospect failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvement well an inability to successfully execute repositioning project or to effectively manage our workforce may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our business our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvement in addition we seek productivity and cost saving benefit through repositioning action and project such consolidation of manufacturing facility transition to cost competitive region and product line rationalization risk associated with these action include delay in execution of the planned initiative additional unexpected cost realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvement and adverse effect on employee morale we may not realize the full operational or financial benefit we expect the recognition of these benefit may be delayed and these action may potentially disrupt our operation in addition organizational change attrition labor relation difficulty or workforce stoppage could have material adverse effect on our business reputation financial position and result of operation supplier to the government we are subject to unique risk such the right of the government to terminate contract for convenience and to conduct audit and investigation of our operation and performance government contract are subject to termination by the government either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the term of the applicable contract our contract with the government are also subject to government audit that may recommend downward price adjustment and other change appropriate and prudent we have made adjustment and paid voluntary refund in the past and may do in the future we are also subject to government investigation of business practice and compliance with government procurement regulation if result of any such investigation or other government investigation including investigation of violation of certain environmental employment or export law honeywell or one of it business were found to have violated applicable law it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving award of new government contract suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceeding and or have it export privilege suspended our operation and the prior operation of predecessor company expose to the risk of material environmental liability mainly because of past operation and operation of predecessor company we are subject to potentially material liability related to the remediation of environmental hazard and to claim of personal injury or property damage that may be caused by hazardous substance release and exposure we continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean cost for site contamination and are party to lawsuit and claim associated with environmental and safety matter including past production of product containing hazardous substance additional lawsuit claim and cost involving environmental matter are likely to continue to arise in the future various federal state local and foreign government regulate the discharge of material into the environment and can impose substantial fine and criminal sanction for violation and require installation of costly equipment or operational change to limit emission and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance release in addition change in law regulation and enforcement of policy the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual site the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standard with respect to certain contaminant or the imposition of new clean up requirement or remedial technique could require to incur additional cost in the future that would have negative effect on our financial condition or result of operation cybersecurity incident could disrupt business operation result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and result of operation global cybersecurity threat and incident can range from uncoordinated individual attempt to gain unauthorized access to information technology it system to sophisticated and targeted measure known advanced persistent threat directed at the company it product it customer and or it third party service provider including cloud provider our customer including the government are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protection and mandating cybersecurity standard in our product and we may incur additional cost to comply with such demand while we have experienced and expect to continue to experience these type of threat and incident none of them to date have been material to the company we seek to deploy comprehensive measure to deter prevent detect respond to and mitigate these threat including identity and access control data protection vulnerability assessment product software design which we believe are le susceptible to cyber attack continuous monitoring of our it network and system and maintenance of backup and protective system despite these effort cybersecurity incident depending on their nature and scope could potentially result in the misappropriation destruction corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information our or that of third party and the disruption of business operation cybersecurity incident aimed at the software imbedded in our product could lead to third party claim that our product failure have caused similar range of damage to our customer and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our product the potential consequence of material cybersecurity incident include financial loss reputational damage litigation with third party theft of intellectual property fine levied by the federal trade commission diminution in the value of our investment in research development and engineering and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation cost due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threat which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and result of operation legal and regulatory risk our and non tax liability are dependent in part upon the distribution of income among various jurisdiction in which we operate our future result of operation could be adversely affected by change in the effective tax rate result of change in the mix of earnings in country with differing statutory tax rate change in tax law regulation and judicial ruling or change in the interpretation thereof change in generally accepted accounting principle change in the valuation of deferred tax asset and liability change in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore the result of audit and examination of previously filed tax return and continuing assessment of our tax exposure and various other governmental enforcement initiative our tax expense includes estimate of tax reserve and reflects other estimate and assumption including assessment of future earnings of the company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax asset change in tax law or regulation including multi jurisdictional change enacted in response to the guideline provided by the organization for economic co operation and development oecd to address base erosion and profit shifting and potential comprehensive tax reform which among other thing might change certain tax rule impacting the way based multinationals are taxed will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income tax change in legislation or government regulation or policy can have significant impact

foreign subsidiary if the amount held outside of the were to be repatriated under current law they would be subject to federal income tax le applicable foreign tax credit however our intent is to permanently reinvest the vast majority of these fund outside of the it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated and the amount of foreign tax credit that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting income tax liability we monitor the third party depository institution that hold our cash and cash equivalent on daily basis our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those fund we diversify our cash and cash equivalent among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entity source of liquidity is our ability to issue short term debt in the commercial paper market commercial paper note are sold at discount and have maturity of not more

pension contribution in we are not required to make contribution to our pension plan we plan to make contribution of cash and or marketable security of approximately million million of marketable security were contributed in january to our non plan to satisfy regulatory funding standard the timing and amount of contribution to both our and non plan may be impacted by number of factor including the funded status of the plan repositioning action we expect that cash spending for severance and other exit cost necessary to execute repositioning action will approximate million in environmental remediation cost we expect to spend approximately million in for remedial response and voluntary clean up cost we continuously ass the relative strength of each business in our portfolio to strategic fit market position profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business unit that will most benefit from increased investment we identify acquisition

measure of note to financial statement for further discussion on the agreement critical accounting policy the preparation of our consolidated financial statement in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle is based on the selection and application of accounting policy that require to make significant estimate and assumption about the effect of matter that are inherently uncertain we consider the accounting policy discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statement actual result could differ from our estimate and assumption and any such difference could be material to our consolidated financial statement contingent liability we are subject to number of lawsuit investigation and claim some of which involve substantial dollar amount that arise out of the conduct of our global business operation or those of previously owned entity including matter relating to commercial transaction government contract product liability including asbestos prior acquisition and divestiture employee benefit plan intellectual property legal and environmental health and safety matter we continually ass the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to our contingency well potential amount or range of probable loss and recognize liability if any for these contingency based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other expert such analysis includes making judgment concerning matter such the cost associated with environmental matter the outcome of negotiation the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claim and the impact of evidentiary requirement because most contingency are resolved over long period of time liability may change in the future due to new development including new discovery of fact change in legislation and outcome of similar case through the judicial system change in assumption or change in our settlement strategy see note commitment and contingency of note to financial statement for discussion of management judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liability which represent our most significant contingency asbestos related contingency and insurance recovery honeywell involvement in asbestos related personal injury action relates to two predecessor company regarding north american refractory company narco asbestos related claim we accrued for pending claim based on term and condition in agreement with narco it former parent company and certain asbestos claimant and an estimate of the unsettled claim pending of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection we also accrued for the estimated value of future narco asbestos related claim expected to be asserted against the narco trust the estimate of future narco claim is based on commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy court addressing trust and also reflects dispute concerning implementation of the trust distribution procedure by the narco trust lack of sufficient trust claim processing experience well the stay of all narco asbestos claim which remained in place throughout narco chapter case some critical assumption underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claim filing rate disease criterion and payment value contained in the trust distribution procedure estimated approval rate of claim submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological study estimating disease instance the estimated value of future narco claim wa originally established at the time of the narco chapter filing reflecting claim expected to be asserted against narco over fifteen year period this projection resulted in range of estimated liability of million to million we believe that no amount within this range is better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range regarding bendix asbestos related claim we accrued for the estimated value of pending claim using average resolution value for the previous five year we also accrued for the estimated value of future anticipated claim related to bendix for the next five year based on historic claim filing experience and dismissal rate disease classification and average resolution value in the tort system for the previous five year in light of the uncertainty inherent in making long term projection well certain factor unique to friction product asbestos claim we do not believe that we have reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claim beyond the next five year in connection with the recognition of liability for asbestos related matter we record asbestos related insurance recovery that are deemed probable in assessing the probability of insurance recovery we make judgment concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealing and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issue surrounding insurer while the substantial majority of our insurance carrier are solvent some of our individual carrier are insolvent which ha been considered in our analysis of probable recovery projecting future event is subject to various uncertainty that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liability to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded given the inherent uncertainty in making future projection we reevaluate our projection concerning our probable insurance recovery in light of any change to the projected liability our recovery experience or other relevant factor that may impact future insurance recovery see note commitment and contingency of note to financial statement for discussion of management judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liability and related insurance recovery defined benefit pension plan we sponsor both funded and unfunded and non defined benefit pension plan for financial reporting purpose net periodic pension income expense is calculated annually based upon number of actuarial assumption including discount rate for plan obligation and an expected long term rate of return on plan asset change in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan asset could materially affect the annual pension income expense amount annual pension income expense is comprised of potential mark to market adjustment mtm adjustment and service and interest cost assumed return on plan asset and prior service amortization pension ongoing income expense the key assumption used in developing our and net periodic pension income expense for our plan included the following discount rate projected benefit obligation service cost interest cost asset expected rate of return actual rate of return actual year average annual compounded rate of return in and the discount rate methodology wa changed in fourth quarter of see note pension and other postretirement benefit of note to financial statement the mtm adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gain or loss in excess of the corridor net actuarial gain and loss occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumption used to value our pension plan or when assumption change the primary factor contributing to actuarial gain and loss are change in the discount rate used to value pension obligation of the measurement date each year and the difference expected and actual return on plan asset the mark to market accounting method result in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast mtm adjustment mtm charge were million million and million in and we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan asset utilizing historical plan asset return over varying long term period combined with our expectation of future market condition and asset mix consideration see note pension and other postretirement benefit of note to financial statement for detail on the actual various asset class and targeted asset allocation percentage for our pension plan we plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan asset of for this is long term rate based on historical plan asset return over varying long term period combined with our expectation of future market condition and the asset mix of the plan investment the discount rate reflects the market rate on december measurement date for high quality fixed income investment with maturity corresponding to our benefit obligation and is subject to change each year the discount rate can be volatile from year to year it is determined based upon prevailing interest rate of the measurement date we used discount rate to determine benefit obligation of december reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year end in addition to the potential for mtm adjustment change in our expected rate of return on plan asset and discount rate resulting from economic event also affect future pension ongoing income expense the following table highlight the sensitivity of our pension obligation and ongoing income expense to change in these assumption assuming all other assumption remain constant these estimate exclude any potential mtm adjustment impact on pension change in assumption ongoing expense impact on pbo percentage point decrease in discount rate decrease million increase million percentage point increase in discount rate increase million decrease million percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on asset increase million percentage point increase in expected rate of return on asset decrease million pension ongoing income for all of our pension plan is expected to be approximately million in compared with pension ongoing income of million in the expected increase is primarily due to higher asset return in and lower interest cost due to decline in discount rate mainly in our and uk plan also if required an mtm adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of in accordance with our pension accounting method previously described it is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be mtm adjustment in and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be mtm adjustment are primarily driven by event and circumstance beyond the control of the company such change in interest rate and the performance of the financial market long lived asset including tangible and finite lived intangible asset the determination of useful life for depreciation amortization purpose and whether or not tangible and intangible asset are impaired involves the use of accounting estimate and assumption change in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual result differ from such estimate and assumption we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long lived asset whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of long lived asset group may not be fully recoverable the principal factor in considering when to perform an impairment review are follows significant under performance decline in sale earnings or cash flow of business or product line in relation to expectation annual operating plan or five year strategic plan that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of business or product line significant negative industry or economic trend or significant change or planned change in our use of the asset it is determined that an impairment review is necessary recoverability of asset is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flow if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flow the asset grouping is considered to be impaired the impairment is then measured the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and it fair value we endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value which is usually either market price if available level or level of the fair value hierarchy or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow level of the fair value hierarchy the key estimate in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumption to expected industry growth rate sale volume selling price and cost and the discount rate selected these estimate are subject to change in the economic environment including market interest rate and expected volatility management belief the estimate of future cash flow and fair value are reasonable however change in estimate due to variance from assumption could materially affect the valuation goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing goodwill and intangible asset deemed to have indefinite life are not amortized but are subject to annual or more frequent if necessary impairment testing in testing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset the fair value is estimated utilizing discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecast in our five year strategic and annual operating plan adjusted for terminal value assumption these impairment test involve the use of accounting estimate and assumption change in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual result differ from such estimate and assumption to address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimate and assumption income tax on recurring basis we ass the need for valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset by considering all available positive and negative evidence such past operating result projection of future taxable income enacted tax law change and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiative our projection of future taxable income include number of estimate and assumption regarding our volume pricing and cost well the timing and amount of reversal of taxable temporary difference sale recognition on long term contract in we recognized approximately of our

business have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup cost for site contamination and are party to lawsuit and claim associated with environmental and safety matter including past production of product containing hazardous substance additional lawsuit claim and cost involving environmental matter are likely to continue to arise in the future with respect to environmental matter involving site contamination we continually conduct study individually or jointly with other potentially responsible party to determine the feasibility of various remedial technique it is our policy to record appropriate liability for environmental matter when remedial effort or damage claim payment are probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated such liability are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future cost required to complete the remedial work the recorded liability are adjusted periodically remediation effort progress or additional technical regulatory or legal information becomes available given the uncertainty regarding the status of law regulation enforcement policy the impact of other potentially responsible party technology and information related to individual site we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of honeywell international inc note to financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount our recorded liability we expect to fund expenditure for these matter from operating cash flow the timing of cash expenditure depends on number of factor

future completion of study litigation or settlement and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate cost associated with environmental matter can be determined although they could be material to

statement continued dollar in million except per share amount and future narco asbestos claim both honeywell and narco are protected by permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual action in state or federal court and requiring all asbestos related claim based on exposure to narco asbestos containing product to be made against the narco trust the narco trust review submitted claim and determines award amount in accordance with established trust distribution procedure approved by the bankruptcy court which set forth the criterion claimant must meet to qualify for compensation including among other thing exposure and medical criterion that determine the award amount in addition honeywell provided and continues to provide input to the design of control procedure for processing narco claim and ha on going audit right to review and monitor the claim processor adherence to the established requirement of the trust distribution procedure honeywell is obligated to fund narco asbestos claim submitted to the narco trust which qualify for payment under the trust distribution procedure annual contribution claim subject to annual cap of million in the year and and million for each year thereafter however the initial million of claim processed through the narco trust the initial claim amount will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the initial claim amount will roll over to subsequent year until fully utilized in honeywell filed suit against the narco trust in bankruptcy court alleging breach of certain provision of the trust agreement and trust distribution procedure the party agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an month standstill agreement that expires in october claim processing will continue during this period subject to defined dispute resolution process of december honeywell ha not made any payment to the narco trust for annual contribution claim honeywell is also responsible for payment due to claimant pursuant to settlement agreement reached during the pendency of the narco bankruptcy proceeding that provide for the right to submit claim to the narco trust subject to qualification under the term of the settlement agreement and trust distribution procedure criterion pre established unliquidated claim which amount are estimated at million and are expected to be paid during the initial year of trust operation million of which ha been paid since the effective date of the narco trust such payment are not subject to the annual cap described above our consolidated financial statement reflect an estimated liability for pre established unliquidated claim million unsettled claim pending of the time narco filed for bankruptcy protection million and for the estimated value of future narco asbestos claim expected to be asserted against the narco trust million the estimate of future narco claim is based on commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy court addressing trust and also reflects dispute concerning implementation of the trust distribution procedure by the narco trust lack of sufficient trust claim processing experience well the stay of all narco asbestos claim which remained in place throughout narco chapter case some critical assumption underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claim filing rate disease criterion and payment value contained in the trust distribution procedure estimated approval rate of claim submitted to the narco trust and epidemiological study estimating disease instance the estimated value of future narco claim wa originally established at the time of the narco chapter filing reflecting claim expected to be asserted against narco over fifteen year period this projection resulted in range of estimated liability of million to million we believe that no amount within this range is better estimate than any other amount and accordingly we have recorded the minimum amount in the range our insurance receivable corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future narco asbestos claim reflects coverage which reimburses honeywell for portion of narco related indemnity and defense cost and is provided by large number of insurance policy written by dozen of insurance company in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market we conduct analysis to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claim while the substantial majority of our insurance carrier are solvent some of our individual carrier are insolvent which ha been considered in our analysis of probable recovery we made judgment concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealing and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issue surrounding insurer projecting future event is subject to many uncertainty that could cause the narco related asbestos liability or asset to be higher or lower than those projected and recorded given the uncertainty we review our estimate periodically and update them based on our experience and other relevant factor similarly we will reevaluate our projection concerning our probable insurance recovery in light of any change to the projected liability or other development that may impact insurance recovery honeywell international inc note to

is not possible to predict whether resolution value for bendix related asbestos claim will increase decrease or stabilize in the future our consolidated financial statement reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending claim actually filed of the financial statement date and future bendix related asbestos claim we have valued bendix pending and future claim using average resolution value for the previous five year we update the resolution value used to estimate the cost of bendix pending and future claim during the fourth quarter each year the liability for future claim represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claim expected to be asserted against bendix over the next five year such estimated cost of future bendix related asbestos claim is based on historic claim filing experience and dismissal rate disease classification and resolution value in the tort system for the previous five year in light of the uncertainty inherent in making long term projection well certain factor unique to friction product asbestos claim we do not believe that we have reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claim beyond the next five year the methodology used to estimate the liability for future claim is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future narco related asbestos claim our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future bendix asbestos claim reflects coverage which is provided by large number of insurance policy written by dozen of insurance company in both the domestic insurance market and the london excess market based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statement simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claim this determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policy our historical experience with our insurer our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurer judicial determination relevant to our insurance program and our consideration of the impact of any settlement reached with our insurer honeywell international inc note to financial statement continued dollar in million except per share amount honeywell belief it ha sufficient insurance coverage and reserve to cover all pending bendix related asbestos claim and bendix related asbestos claim estimated to be filed within the next five year although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending or future bendix related asbestos claim we do not believe that such claim would have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claim if the rate and type of claim filed the average resolution value of such claim and the period of time over which claim settlement are paid collectively the variable claim factor do not substantially change honeywell would not expect future bendix related asbestos claim to have material adverse effect on our result of operation or operating cash flow in any fiscal year no assurance can be given however that the variable claim factor will not change other matter we are subject to number of other lawsuit investigation and dispute some of which involve substantial amount claimed arising out of the conduct of our business including matter relating to commercial transaction government contract product liability prior acquisition and divestiture employee benefit plan intellectual property and environmental health and safety matter we recognize liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable we continually ass the likelihood of adverse judgment of outcome in these matter well potential range of possible loss taking into consideration any insurance recovery based on careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and if applicable other expert included in these other matter are the following honeywell united auto worker uaw et al in july honeywell filed an action in federal court district of new jersey against the uaw and all former employee who retired under series of master collective bargaining agreement mcbas between honeywell and the uaw seeking declaratory judgment that certain express limitation on it obligation to contribute toward the healthcare coverage of such retiree the cap set forth in the mcbas may be implemented effective january the uaw and certain retiree defendant filed mirror suit in the eastern district of michigan alleging that the mcbas do not provide for cap on the company liability for healthcare coverage the new jersey action wa dismissed and honeywell subsequently answered the uaw complaint in michigan and asserted counterclaim for fraudulent inducement negligent misrepresentation and breach of implied warranty the uaw filed motion to dismiss these counterclaim the court dismissed honeywell fraudulent inducement and negligent misrepresentation claim but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty in the second quarter of the party agreed to stay the proceeding with respect to those retiree who retired before the initial inclusion of the cap in the mcba until the supreme court decided the polymer usa llc tackett case in ruling on january the supreme court held that retiree health insurance benefit provided in collective bargaining agreement do not carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life and that the vesting issue must be decided pursuant to ordinary principle of contract law the stay of the proceeding ha been lifted and the case is proceeding based on the supreme court ruling honeywell is confident that the cap will be upheld and that it liability for healthcare coverage premium with respect to the putative class will be limited negotiated and expressly set forth in the applicable mcbas in the event of an adverse ruling however honeywell other postretirement benefit for pre retiree would increase by approximately million reflecting the estimated value of these cap in december the uaw and certain of the plaintiff filed motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retiree who retired after the initial inclusion of the cap in the mcba the uaw sought ruling that the mcba did not limit honeywell obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for the post retiree that motion remains pending honeywell is confident that the court will find that the mcba in fact limit honeywell retiree healthcare obligation for post retiree in the event of an adverse ruling however honeywell other postretirement benefit for post retiree would increase by approximately million

is possible to develop estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accrual for these matter other than specifically set forth above considering our past experience and existing accrual we do not expect the outcome of these matter either individually or in the aggregate to have material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position because most contingency are resolved over long period of time potential liability are subject to change due to new development change in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirement which could cause to pay damage award or settlement or become subject to equitable remedy that could have material adverse effect on our result of operation or operating cash flow in the period recognized or paid warranty and guarantee in

other postretirement benefit plan reflects the current rate at which the associated liability could be settled at the measurement date of december to determine discount rate for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan we use modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflow of our benefit plan to yield curve constructed from portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instrument we use the single weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio discount rate benchmark the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligation compared to pension plan obligation during the fourth quarter of we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost component of net periodic benefit income cost for our significant pension plan previously we estimated such cost component utilizing single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation the new methodology utilizes full yield curve approach in the estimation of these cost component by applying the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flow and provides more precise measurement of service and interest cost by improving the correlation between projected cash flow and their corresponding spot rate the change did not affect the measurement of our pension obligation and wa applied prospectively change in estimate for our pension plan the single weighted average spot rate used to determine service and interest cost for are and our expected rate of return on plan asset of is long term rate based on
