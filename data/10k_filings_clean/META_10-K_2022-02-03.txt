delaware corporation and appropriate it subsidiary the term family refers to our facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp product for reference to accessing meta product on the web or via website such term refer to accessing such product on personal computer for reference to accessing meta product on mobile such term refers to accessing such product via mobile application or via mobile optimized version of our website such facebook com whether on mobile phone or tablet of contentslimitations of key metric and other datathe number for our key metric are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user account we have historically reported the number of our daily active user daus monthly active user maus and average revenue per user arpu collectively our facebook metric based on user activity on facebook and messenger and not on our other product beginning with our annual report on form for the year ended december we also report our estimate of the number of our daily active people dap monthly active people map and average revenue per person arpp collectively our family metric based on the activity of user visited least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp collectively our family of product during the applicable period of measurement we believe our family metric better reflect the size of our community and the fact that many people are using than one of our product result over time we intend to report our family metric key metric in place of daus maus and arpu in our periodic report filed with the security and exchange commission these number are based on we believe to be reasonable estimate of our user base for the applicable period of measurement are inherent challenge in measuring usage of our product across large online and mobile population around the world the methodology used to measure these metric require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimate of our user base and such estimate may change due to improvement or change in our methodology we regularly review our process for calculating these metric and from time to time we discover inaccuracy in our metric or make adjustment to improve accuracy which can result in adjustment to our historical metric our ability to recalculate our historical metric may be impacted by data limitation or other factor that require to apply different methodology for such adjustment we generally not intend to update previously disclosed family metric for any such inaccuracy or adjustment that are within the error margin disclosed in addition our family metric and facebook metric estimate will differ from estimate published by third party due to difference in methodology family metricsmany people in our community have user account on more than one of our product and people have multiple user account within an individual product accordingly for our family metric we do not seek to count the total number of user account across our product we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metric represent our estimate of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger and whatsapp we do not require people to use common identifier or link their account to use multiple product in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people to calculate these metric we rely upon complex technique algorithm and machine learning model that seek to count the individual people behind user account including by matching multiple user account within an individual product and across multiple product we believe are attributable to single person and counting such group of account one person these technique and model require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitation discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variance and uncertainty we estimate the potential error in our family metric primarily based on user survey data which is subject to error well while we expect the error margin for our family metric to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people and it is possible that the actual number of unique people using our product may vary significantly from our estimate potentially beyond our estimated error margin result it is also possible that our family metric may indicate change or trend in user number that do not match actual change or trend to calculate our estimate of family dap and map we currently use series of machine learning model that are developed based on internal review of limited sample of user account and calibrated user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these model and calculating these estimate for example to match user account within individual product and across multiple product we use data signal such similar device information ip address and user name we also calibrate our model against data from periodic user survey of varying size and frequency across our product which are inherently subject to error the timing and result of such user survey have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to change in our reported family metric from period to period in addition our data limitation may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metric estimate our technique and model rely on variety of data signal from different product and we rely on more limited data signal of contentsfor some product compared to others for example result of limited visibility encrypted product we have fewer data signal from whatsapp user account and primarily rely on phone number and device information to match whatsapp user account with account on our other product similarly although messenger kid user are included in our family metric we do not seek to match their account with account on our other application for purpose of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signal we use in our process for calculating family metric whether result of our product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metric well our ability to report these metric at all our estimate of family metric also may change our methodology evolve including the application of new data signal or technology product change or other improvement in our user survey algorithm or machine learning that may improve our ability to match account within and across our product or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our user in addition such evolution may allow to identify previously undetected violating account defined below we regularly evaluate our family metric to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account we define violating account account which we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service including bot and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating account such estimation is based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behavior associated with facebook and instagram account that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewer we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person ha one or more violating account we do not include such person in our violating account estimation long we believe they have one account that not constitute violating account from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of violating account among our user which may also reduce our dap and map estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account on an annual basis violating account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating account may vary significantly from our estimate the number of family dap and map discussed in this annual report on form well arpp do not include user on our other product unless they would otherwise qualify dap or map respectively based on their other activity on our family product facebook metricswe regularly evaluate our facebook metric to estimate the number of duplicate and false account among our maus duplicate account is one that user maintains in addition to or principal account we divide false account into two category user misclassified account where user have created personal profile for business organization or non human entity such pet such entity are permitted on facebook using page rather than personal profile under our term of service and violating account which represent user profile that we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service such bot and spam the estimate of duplicate and false account are based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate account we use data signal such identical ip address and similar user name and to identify false account we look for name that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewer any loss of access to data signal we use in this process whether result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimate of duplicate and false account our estimate also may change our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology or product change that may allow to identify previously undetected duplicate or false account and may improve our ability to evaluate broader population of our user duplicate and false account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false account may vary significantly from our estimate in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate account is meaningfully higher in developing market such the philippine and vietnam compared to more developed market in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false account can vary result of episodic spike in the creation of such account which we have seen originate more frequently in specific country of contentssuch indonesia nigeria and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of duplicate or false account among our user which may also reduce our dau and mau estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the number of duplicate and false account among our maus on an annual basis the number of daus and maus discussed in this annual report on form well arpu do not include user on instagram whatsapp or our other product unless they would otherwise qualify daus or maus respectively based on their other activity on facebook user geographyour data regarding the geographic location of our user is estimated based on number of factor such the user ip address and self disclosed location these factor may not always accurately reflect the user actual location for example user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user actual location the methodology used to measure our metric are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error and our estimate for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these

marketing our product and service to grow our brand and help build community around the world intellectual property to establish and protect our proprietary right we rely on combination of patent trademark copyright trade secret including know license agreement confidentiality procedure non disclosure agreement with third party employee disclosure and invention assignment agreement and other contractual right in addition to protect our proprietary right from time to time we have purchased patent and patent application from third party we do not believe that our proprietary technology is dependent on any single patent or copyright or group of related patent or copyright we believe the duration of our patent is adequate relative to the expected life of our product government regulation we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad that involve matter central to our business many of which are still evolving and tested in court and could be interpreted in way that could harm our business these law and regulation involve matter including privacy data use data protection and personal information biometrics encryption right of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contract and other communication competition protection of minor consumer protection civil right telecommunication product liability commerce taxation economic or other trade control including sanction anti corruption and political law compliance security law compliance and online payment service in particular we are subject to federal state and foreign law regarding privacy and protection of people data foreign data protection privacy content competition consumer protection and other law and regulation can impose different obligation or penalty or fine for non compliance or be more restrictive than those in the united state of contentsthese federal and state and foreign law and regulation which in some case can be enforced by private party in addition to government entity are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change result the application interpretation and enforcement of these law and regulation are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policy and practice for example regulatory or legislative action affecting the manner in which we display content to our user or obtain consent to various practice or otherwise relating to content that is made available on our product could adversely affect our financial result in the united state there have been and continue to be various effort to remove or restrict the scope of the protection available to online platform under section of the communication decency act and any such change may increase our cost or require significant change to our product business practice or operation which could adversely affect our business and financial result we are also subject to evolving law and regulation that dictate whether how and under what circumstance we can transfer process and or receive certain data that is critical to our operation including data shared between country or region in which we operate and data shared among our product and service if we are unable to transfer data between and among country and region in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our product and service it could affect our ability to provide our service the manner in which we provide our service or our ability to target ad which could adversely affect our financial result for example the privacy shield transfer framework we relied upon for data transferred from the european union to the united state wa invalidated in july by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other base upon which meta relies to transfer such data such standard contractual clause sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny in august we received preliminary draft decision from the irish data protection commission idpc that preliminarily concluded that meta platform ireland reliance on sccs in respect of european user data doe not achieve compliance with the general data protection regulation gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfer of user data from the european union to the united state therefore be suspended we believe final decision in this inquiry may issue early the first half of if new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or rely upon other alternative mean of data transfer from europe to the united state we will likely be unable to offer number of our most significant product and service including facebook and instagram in europe which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation we have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory development in the past and proposed or new legislation and regulation could significantly affect our business for example the gdpr includes operational requirement for company that receive or process personal data of resident of the european union that are different from those previously in place in the european union requires submission of personal data breach notification to our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalty for non compliance with the notification obligation well other requirement of the regulation the gdpr is still relatively new law it interpretation is still evolving and draft decision in investigation by the idpc are subject to review by other european privacy regulator part of the gdpr consistency mechanism which may lead to significant change in the final outcome of such investigation result the interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr well the imposition and amount of penalty for non compliance are subject to significant uncertainty in addition brazil the united kingdom and other country have enacted similar data protection regulation imposing data privacy related requirement on product and service offered to user in their respective jurisdiction the california consumer privacy act which took effect in january and it successor the california privacy right act which will take effect in january also establish certain transparency rule and create new data privacy right for user in addition effective december the european union eprivacy directive includes additional limitation on the use of data across messaging product and includes significant penalty for non compliance change to our product or business practice result of these or similar development may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are number of legislative proposal in the european union the united state at both the federal and state level well other jurisdiction that could impose new obligation or limitation in area affecting our business for example the proposed digital market act in the european union and pending proposal to modify competition law in the united state and other jurisdiction could cause to incur significant compliance cost and could potentially impose new restriction and requirement on company like including in area such the combination of data across service merger and acquisition and product design in addition some country such india are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirement or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirement that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our service new legislation or regulatory decision that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minor may also result in limitation on our advertising service or our ability to offer product and service to minor in certain jurisdiction of contentswe are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigation inquiry data request request for information action and audit by government authority and regulator in the united state europe and around the world particularly in the area of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection civil right content moderation and competition we continue to grow and expand our operation we are also currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory order or consent decree including the modified consent order we entered into with the federal trade commission ftc which took effect in april and among other matter requires to maintain comprehensive privacy program order issued by or inquiry or enforcement action initiated by government or regulatory authority could cause to incur substantial cost expose to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalty including substantial monetary remedy interrupt or require to change our business practice in manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resource and the time and attention of management from our business or subject to other structural or behavioral remedy that adversely affect our business for additional information about government

performance ha been and will continue to be significantly determined by our success in adding retaining and engaging active user of our product that deliver ad impression particularly for facebook and instagram we anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue to generally decline over time the size of our active user base increase in addition we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuation and decline in the size of our active user base in one or more market from time to time particularly in market where we have achieved higher penetration rate user growth and engagement are also impacted by number of other factor including competitive product and service such tiktok that have reduced some user engagement with our product and service well global and regional business and macroeconomic condition for example beginning in the first quarter of we experienced significant increase in the size and engagement of our active user base across number of region result of the covid pandemic more recently we have seen these pandemic related trend subside we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trend may continue to be subject to volatility in the fourth quarter of we experienced slight decline on quarter over quarter basis in the total number of daus on facebook well slight decline on quarter over quarter basis in the number of daus on facebook in the united state canada region any future decline in the size of our active user base may adversely impact our ability to

maintain or increase the frequency and duration of their engagement number of other social networking company that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user base or level of engagement decline in some case precipitously there is no guarantee that we will not experience similar erosion of our active user base or engagement level our user engagement pattern have changed over time and user engagement can be difficult to measure particularly we introduce new and different product and service any number of factor can negatively affect user retention growth and engagement including if user increasingly engage with other competitive product or service we fail to introduce new feature product or service that user find engaging or if we introduce new product or service or make change to existing product and service that are not favorably received user feel that their experience is diminished result of the decision we make with respect to the frequency of

unable to continue to develop product for mobile device that user find engaging that work with variety of mobile operating system and network and that achieve high level of market acceptance there are decrease in user sentiment due to question about the quality or usefulness of our product or our user data practice concern about the nature of content made available on our product or concern related

attract and retain user and engagement are unsuccessful or discontinued whether result of action by third party or otherwise of content third party initiative that may enable greater use of our product including low cost or discounted data plan are scaled back or discontinued or the pricing of data plan otherwise increase there is decreased engagement with our product result of tax imposed on the use of social medium or other mobile application in certain country internet shutdown or other action by government that affect the accessibility of our product in their country we fail to provide adequate customer service to user marketer developer or other partner we developer whose product are integrated with our product or other partner and company in our industry are the subject of adverse medium report or other negative publicity including result of our or their user data practice or our current or future product such our development tool and application programming interface that enable developer to build grow and monetize mobile and web application reduce user activity on our product by making it easier for our user to interact and share on third party mobile and web application from time to time certain of these factor have negatively affected user retention growth and engagement to varying degree if we are unable to maintain or increase our user base and user engagement particularly for our significant revenue generating product like facebook and instagram our revenue and financial result may be adversely affected any significant decrease in user retention growth or engagement could render our product le attractive to user marketer and developer which is likely to have material and adverse impact on our ability to deliver ad impression and accordingly our revenue business financial condition and result of operation our active user growth rate continues to slow we will become increasingly dependent on our ability to maintain or increase level of user engagement and monetization in order to drive revenue growth we generate substantially all of our revenue from advertising the loss of marketer or reduction in spending by marketer could seriously harm our business substantially all of our revenue is currently generated from third party advertising on facebook and instagram is common in the industry our marketer do not have long term advertising commitment with many of our marketer spend only relatively small portion of their overall advertising budget with marketer will not continue to do business with or they will reduce the budget they are willing to commit to if we do not deliver ad in an effective manner if they do not believe that their investment in advertising with will generate competitive return relative to other alternative or if they are not satisfied for any other reason we have implemented and we will continue to implement change to our user data practice some of these change reduce our ability to effectively target ad which ha to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business if we are unable to provide marketer with suitable return on investment the pricing of our ad may not increase or may decline in which case our revenue and financial result may be harmed our advertising revenue can also be adversely affected by number of other factor including decrease in user engagement including time spent on our product our inability to continue to increase user access to and engagement with our product product change or inventory management decision we may make that change the size format frequency or relative prominence of ad displayed on our product or of other unpaid content shared by marketer on our product our inability to maintain

of analytics and measurement solution offered by or third party that demonstrate the value of our ad to marketer or our ability to further improve such tool loss of advertising market share to our competitor including if price to purchase our ad increase or if competitor offer lower priced more integrated or otherwise more effective product limitation on our ability to offer number of our most significant product and service including facebook and instagram in europe result of european regulator court or legislative body determining that our reliance on sccs or other legal base we rely upon

result of decision or recommendation from the independent oversight board developer with mobile and web application that are integrated with our product or other company in our industry reduction of advertising by marketer due to objectionable content made available on our product by third party question about our user data practice or the security of our platform concern about brand safety or potential legal liability or uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligation for example number of marketer announced that they paused advertising with in july due to concern about content on our product the effectiveness of our ad targeting or degree to which user opt in or of the use of data for ad including result of product change and control that we have implemented or may implement in the future in connection with the gdpr eprivacy directive california consumer privacy act ccpa other law regulation regulatory action or litigation or otherwise that impact our ability to use data for advertising purpose the degree to which user cease or reduce the number of time they engage with our ad change in the way advertising on mobile device or on personal computer is measured or priced the success of technology designed to block the display of ad or ad measurement tool change in the composition of our marketer base or our inability to maintain or grow our marketer base and the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical condition whether in the advertising industry in general or among specific type of marketer or within particular geography from time to time certain of these factor have adversely affected our advertising revenue to varying degree the occurrence of any of these or other factor in the future could result in reduction in demand for our ad which may reduce the price we receive for our ad or cause marketer to stop advertising with altogether either of which would negatively affect our revenue and financial result for example macroeconomic condition have affected and may in the future affect marketer ability or willingness to spend with we experienced in with the regional and worldwide economic of contentsdisruption related to the covid pandemic and associated decline in advertising activity on our product the effect of the pandemic previously resulted in reduced demand for our ad related decline in pricing of our ad and additional demand on our technical infrastructure result of increased usage of our service and any similar occurrence in the future may impair our ability to maintain or increase the quantity or quality of ad shown to user and adversely affect our revenue and financial result our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tool that incorporate data signal from user activity on website and service that we do not control and change to the regulatory environment third party mobile operating system and browser and our own product have impacted and we expect will continue to impact the availability of such signal which will adversely affect our advertising revenue we rely on data signal from user activity on website and service that we do not control in order to deliver relevant and effective ad to our user our advertising revenue is dependent on targeting and measurement tool that incorporate these signal and any change in our ability to use such signal will adversely affect our business for example legislative and regulatory development such the gdpr eprivacy directive and ccpa have impacted and we expect will continue to impact our ability to use such signal in our ad product in particular we have seen an increasing number of user opt to control certain type of ad targeting in europe following adoption of the gdpr which will increase further with expanded control over certain third party data part of our eprivacy directive compliance and we have introduced product change that limit data signal use for certain user in california following adoption of the ccpa regulatory guidance or decision or new legislation in these or other jurisdiction may require to make additional change to our product in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signal in addition mobile operating system and browser provider such apple and google have implemented product change and or announced future plan to limit the ability of website and application developer to collect and use these signal to target and measure advertising for example in apple made certain change to it product and data use policy in connection with change to it io operating system that reduce our and other io developer ability to target and measure advertising which ha negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact the size of the budget marketer are willing to commit to and other advertising platform in addition we have implemented and may continue to implement product change that give user the ability to limit our use of such data signal to improve ad and other experience on our product and service including our off facebook activity tool and our worldwide offering of certain product change we implemented in connection with the gdpr these development have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ad on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue for example our advertising revenue in the second half of wa negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenge associated with io change if we are unable to mitigate these development they take further effect in the future our targeting and measurement capability will be materially and adversely affected which would in turn significantly impact our future advertising revenue growth our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile device depend upon effective operation with mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control the substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile device there is no guarantee that popular mobile device will continue to feature our product or that mobile device user will continue to use our product rather than competing product we are dependent on the interoperability of our product with popular mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control such the android and io operating system and mobile browser any change bug or technical issue in such system or change in our relationship with mobile operating system partner handset manufacturer browser developer or mobile carrier or in their term of service or policy that degrade our product functionality reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our product give preferential treatment to competitive product limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ad or charge fee related to the distribution of our product or our delivery of ad could adversely affect the usage of our product and monetization on mobile device for example apple previously released an update to it safari browser that limit the use of third party cooky which reduces our ability to provide the most relevant ad to our user and impact monetization and also released change to io that limit our ability to target and measure ad effectively we expect that any similar change to it google or other browser or mobile platform will further limit our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ad and impact monetization additionally in order to deliver high quality mobile product it is important that our product work well with range of mobile technology product system network and standard that we do not control and that we have good relationship with handset manufacturer mobile carrier and browser developer we may not be successful in maintaining or developing relationship with key participant in the mobile ecosystem or in developing product that operate effectively with these technology product system network or standard in the event that it is of contentsmore difficult for our user to access and use our product on their mobile device or if our user choose not to access or use our product on their mobile device or use mobile product that do not offer access to our product our user growth and user engagement could be harmed from time to time we may also take action regarding the distribution of our product or the operation of our business based on what we believe to be in our long term best interest such action may adversely affect our user and our relationship with the operator of mobile operating system handset manufacturer mobile carrier browser developer other business partner or advertiser and there is no assurance that these action will result in the anticipated long term benefit in the event that our user are adversely affected by these action or if our relationship with such third party deteriorate our user growth engagement and monetization could be adversely affected and our business could be harmed we have in the past experienced challenge in operating with mobile operating system network technology product and standard that we do not control and any such occurrence in the future may negatively impact our user growth engagement and monetization on mobile device which may in turn materially and adversely affect our business and financial result our new product and change to existing product could fail to attract or retain user or generate revenue and profit our ability to retain increase and engage our user base and to increase our revenue depends heavily on our ability to continue to evolve our existing product and to create successful new product both independently and in conjunction with developer or other third party we may introduce significant change to our existing product or acquire or introduce new and unproven product including using technology with which we have little or no prior development or operating experience for example we do not have significant experience with consumer hardware product or virtual or augmented reality technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these product and technology we continue to incur substantial cost and we may not be successful in generating profit in connection with these effort in addition the introduction of new product or change to existing product may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny litigation or other complication that could adversely affect our business and financial result we have also invested and expect to continue to invest significant resource in growing our whatsapp and messenger product to support increasing usage of such product we have historically monetized messaging in only limited fashion and we may not be successful in our effort to generate meaningful revenue or profit from messaging over the long term in addition we are moving forward with plan to implement end to end encryption across our messaging service well facilitate cross app communication between these platform which plan have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny in multiple jurisdiction if our new or enhanced product fail to engage user marketer or developer or if our business plan are unsuccessful we may fail to attract or retain user or to generate sufficient revenue operating margin or other value to justify our investment and our business may be adversely affected we make product and investment decision that may not prioritize short term financial result and may not produce the long term benefit that we expect we frequently make product and investment decision that may not prioritize short term financial result if we believe that the decision are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term for example we have implemented and we will continue to implement change to our user data practice some of these change reduce our ability to effectively target ad which ha to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example our off facebook activity tool enables user to place limit on our storage and use of information about their interaction with advertiser apps and website which reduces our ability to deliver the most relevant and effective ad to our user similarly from time to time we update our news feed ranking algorithm to optimize the user experience and these change have had and may in the future have the effect of reducing time spent and some measure of user engagement with facebook which could adversely affect our financial result from time to time we also change the size frequency or relative prominence of ad part of our product and monetization strategy in addition we have made and we expect to continue to make other change to our product which may adversely affect the distribution of content of publisher marketer and developer and could reduce their incentive to invest in their effort on our product we also may introduce new feature or other change to existing product or introduce new stand alone product that attract user away from property format or use case where we have more proven mean of monetization such our feed product in addition we focus on growing user and engagement across our family of product from time to time these effort have reduced and may in the future reduce engagement with one or more product and service in favor of other product or service that we monetize le successfully or that are not growing quickly for example we plan to continue to promote reel which we do not currently monetize at the rate our feed or story product these decision may adversely affect our business and result of operation and may not produce the long term benefit that we expect of contentswe may not be successful in our metaverse strategy and investment which could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result we believe the metaverse an embodied internet where people have immersive experience beyond two dimensional screen is the next evolution in social technology in we announced shift in our business and product strategy to focus on helping to bring the metaverse to life we expect this will be complex evolving and long term initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technology continued investment in privacy safety and security effort and collaboration with other company developer partner and other participant however the metaverse may not develop in accordance with our expectation and market acceptance of feature product or service we build for the metaverse is uncertain in addition we have limited experience with consumer hardware product and virtual and augmented reality technology which may enable other company to compete more effectively than we may be unsuccessful in our research and product development effort including if we are unable to develop relationship with key participant in the metaverse or develop product that operate effectively with metaverse technology product system network or standard our metaverse effort may also divert resource and management attention from other area of our business we expect to continue to make significant investment in virtual and augmented reality and other technology to support these effort and our ability to support these effort is dependent on generating sufficient profit from other area of our business in addition our metaverse effort evolve we may be subject to variety of existing or new law and regulation in the united state and international jurisdiction including in the area of privacy and commerce which may delay or impede the development of our product and service increase our operating cost require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business result of these or other factor our metaverse strategy and investment may not be successful in the foreseeable future or at all which could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand our ability to expand our base of user marketer and developer may be impaired and our business and financial result may be harmed we believe that our brand have significantly contributed to the success of our business we also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to expanding our base of user marketer and developer many of our new user are referred by existing user maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on our ability to continue to provide useful reliable trustworthy and innovative product which we may not do successfully we may introduce new product or term of service or policy that user do not like which may negatively affect our brand additionally the action of our developer or advertiser may affect our brand if user do not have positive experience using third party mobile and web application integrated with our product or interacting with party that advertise through our product we will also continue to experience medium legislative or regulatory scrutiny of our action or decision regarding user privacy data use encryption content product design algorithm advertising competition and other issue including action or decision in connection with election or the covid pandemic which ha in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our reputation and brand for example beginning in september we became the subject of medium legislative and regulatory scrutiny result of former employee allegation and release of internal company document relating to among other thing our algorithm advertising and user metric and content enforcement practice well misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform and user well being in addition in march we announced development regarding the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy we also may fail to respond expeditiously or appropriately to the sharing of objectionable content on our service or objectionable practice by advertiser or developer or to otherwise enforce our policy or address user concern which ha occurred in the past and which could erode confidence in our brand our brand may also be negatively affected by the action of user that are deemed to be hostile or inappropriate to other user by the action of user acting under false or inauthentic identity by the use of our product or service to disseminate information that is deemed to be misleading or intended to manipulate opinion by perceived or actual effort by government to obtain access to user information for security related purpose or to censor certain content on our platform by the use of our product or service for illicit or objectionable end including for example any such action around the pandemic or election in the united state and around the world by decision or recommendation regarding content on our platform from the independent oversight board by research or medium report concerning the perceived or actual impact of our product or service on user well being or by our decision to remove content or suspend participation on our platform by person who violate our community standard or term of service maintaining and enhancing our brand will require to make substantial investment and these investment may not be successful certain of our action such the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse of data and concern around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content well user well being issue have eroded confidence in our brand and may continue to do so in the future if we of contentsfail to successfully promote and maintain our brand or if we incur excessive expense in this effort our business and financial result may be adversely affected we may not be able to continue to successfully maintain or grow usage of and engagement with mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product we have made and are continuing to make investment to enable developer to build grow and monetize mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product such existing and prospective developer may not be successful in building growing or monetizing mobile and or web application that create and maintain user engagement additionally developer may choose to build on other platform including mobile platform controlled by third party rather than building product that integrate with facebook and our other product we are continuously seeking to balance the distribution objective of our developer with our desire to provide an optimal user experience and we may not be successful in achieving balance that continues to attract and retain such developer for example from time to time we have taken action to reduce the volume of communication from these developer to user on facebook and our other product with the objective of enhancing the user experience and such action have reduced distribution from user engagement with and our monetization opportunity from mobile and web application integrated with our product in addition part of our effort related to privacy safety and security we conduct investigation and audit of platform application from time to time and we also have announced several product change that restrict developer access to certain user data in some instance these action well other action to enforce our policy applicable to developer have adversely affected or will adversely affect our relationship with developer if we are not successful in our effort to maintain or grow the number of developer that choose to build product that integrate with facebook and our other product or if we are unable to continue to build and maintain good relation with such developer our user growth and user engagement and our financial result may be adversely affected risk related to our business operation and financial resultsthe covid pandemic ha previously had and may in the future have significant adverse impact on our advertising revenue and also expose our business to other risk the covid pandemic ha resulted in authority implementing numerous preventative measure from time to time to contain or mitigate the outbreak of the virus such travel ban and restriction limitation on business activity quarantine and shelter in place order these measure have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdown or shutdown in certain affected country and region which have previously significantly impacted our business and result of operation for example in the second quarter of our advertising revenue grew year over year which wa the slowest growth rate for any fiscal quarter since our initial public offering while our advertising revenue growth rate improved in subsequent quarter there can be no assurance that it will not decrease result of the effect of the pandemic in addition we believe that the pandemic previously contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce which in turn increased demand for our advertising service more recently we believe this growth ha moderated in many region and we may experience reduced advertising demand and related decline in pricing in future period to the extent this trend continues which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth the demand for and pricing of our advertising service may be materially and adversely impacted by the pandemic for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such impact with any certainty in addition to the impact on our advertising business the pandemic expose our business operation and workforce to variety of other risk including volatility in the size of our user base and user engagement particularly for our messaging product whether result of shelter in place measure or other factor delay in product development or release or reduction in manufacturing production and sale of consumer hardware result of inventory shortage supply chain or labor shortage increased misuse of our product and service or user data by third party including improper advertising practice or other activity inconsistent with our term contract or policy misinformation or other illicit or objectionable material on our platform election interference or other undesirable activity of content adverse impact to our effort to combat misuse of our product and service and user data result of limitation on our safety security and content review effort while our workforce is working remotely such the necessity to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence to perform task that our workforce is unable to perform significant volatility and disruption of global financial market which could cause fluctuation in currency exchange rate or negatively impact our ability to access capital in the future negative impact on our workforce productivity product development and research and development due to difficulty resulting from our personnel working remotely illness to key employee or significant portion of our workforce which may result in inefficiency delay and disruption in our business and increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial projection we use the basis for estimate used in our financial statement any of these development may adversely affect our business harm our reputation or result in legal or regulatory action against the persistence of covid and the preventative measure implemented to help limit the spread of the illness have impacted and will continue to impact our ability to operate our business and may materially and adversely impact our business financial condition and result of operation our business is highly competitive competition present an ongoing threat to the success of our business we compete with company providing connection sharing discovery and communication product and service to user online well company that sell advertising to business looking to reach consumer and or develop tool and system for managing and optimizing advertising campaign we face significant competition in every aspect of our business including but not limited to company that facilitate the ability of user to share communicate and discover content and information online or enable marketer to reach their existing or prospective audience including for example alphabet google and youtube amazon apple bytedance tiktok microsoft snap snapchat tencent wechat and twitter we compete to attract engage and retain people who use our product to attract and retain business that use our free or paid business and advertising service and to attract and retain developer who build compelling mobile and web application that integrate with our product we also compete with company that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual and augmented reality product and service we introduce or acquire new product our existing product evolve or other company introduce new product and service including part of effort to develop the metaverse we may become subject to additional competition some of our current and potential competitor may have greater resource experience or stronger competitive position in certain product segment geographic region or user demographic than we do for example some of our competitor may be domiciled in different country and subject to political legal and regulatory regime that enable them to compete more effectively than these factor may allow our competitor to respond more effectively than to new or emerging technology and change in market condition we believe that some user particularly younger user are aware of and actively engaging with other product and service similar to or substitute for our product and service and we believe that some user have reduced their use of and engagement with our product and service in favor of these other product and service in the event that user increasingly engage with other product and service we may experience decline in use and engagement in key user demographic or more broadly in which case our business would likely be harmed our competitor may develop product feature or service that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance may undertake more far reaching and successful product development effort or marketing campaign or may adopt more aggressive pricing policy some competitor may gain competitive advantage against in area where we operate including by making acquisition by limiting our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of ad by imposing fee or other charge related to our delivery of ad by making access to our product more difficult or impossible by making it more difficult to communicate with our user or by integrating competing platform application or feature into product they control such mobile device operating system search engine browser or commerce platform for example each of apple and google have integrated competitive product with io and android respectively in addition apple ha released change to io that limit our ability and the ability of others in the digital advertising industry to target and of contentsmeasure ad effectively result our competitor may and in some case will acquire and engage user or generate advertising or other revenue at the expense of our own effort which would negatively affect our business and financial result in addition from time to time we may take action in response to competitive threat but we can not assure you that these action will be successful or that they will not negatively affect our business and financial result we believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factor both within and beyond our control including the popularity usefulness ease of use performance and reliability of our product compared to our competitor product the size and composition of our user base the engagement of user with our product and competing product our ability to attract and retain business who use our free or paid business and advertising service the timing and market acceptance of product including development and enhancement to our or our competitor product our safety and security effort and our ability to protect user data and to provide user with control over their data our ability to distribute our product to new and existing user our ability to monetize our product the frequency size format quality and relative prominence of the ad displayed by or our competitor customer service and support effort marketing and selling effort including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ad and to provide marketer with compelling return on their investment our ability to establish and maintain developer interest in building mobile and web application that integrate with facebook and our other product our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with facebook and our other product change mandated by legislation regulatory authority or litigation some of which may have disproportionate effect on acquisition or consolidation within our industry which may result in more formidable competitor our ability to attract retain and motivate talented employee particularly software engineer designer and product manager our ability to cost effectively manage and grow our operation and our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitor if we are not able to compete effectively our user base level of user engagement and ability to deliver ad impression may decrease we may become le attractive to developer and marketer and our revenue and result of operation may be materially and adversely affected of contentsunfavorable medium coverage negatively affect our business from time to time we receive high degree of medium coverage around the world unfavorable publicity regarding for example our privacy practice advertising policy product change product quality litigation or regulatory activity government surveillance the action of our advertiser the action of our developer whose product are integrated with our product the use of our product or service for illicit or objectionable end the substance or enforcement of our community standard term of service or other policy the action of our user the quality and integrity of content shared on our platform the perceived or actual impact of our product or service on user well being or the action of other company that provide similar service to ours ha in the past and could in the future adversely affect our reputation for example we have been the subject of significant medium coverage involving concern around our handling of political speech and advertising hate speech and other content well user well being issue and we continue to receive negative publicity related to these topic beginning in september we became the subject of significant medium coverage result of allegation and the release of internal company document by former employee in addition we have been and may in the future be subject to negative publicity in connection with our handling of misinformation and other illicit or objectionable use of our product or service including in connection with the covid pandemic and election in the united state and around the world any such negative publicity could have an adverse effect on the size engagement and loyalty of our user base and marketer demand for advertising on our product which could result in decreased revenue and adversely affect our business and financial result and we have experienced such adverse effect to varying degree from time to time our financial result will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict our quarterly financial result have fluctuated in the past and will fluctuate in the future additionally we have limited operating history with the current scale of our business which make it difficult to forecast our future result result you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial result indicator of future performance you should take into account the risk and uncertainty frequently encountered by company in rapidly evolving market our financial result in any given quarter can be influenced by numerous factor many of which we are unable to predict or are outside of our control including our ability to maintain and grow our user base and user engagement particularly for our product that deliver ad impression our ability to attract and retain marketer in particular period our ability to recognize revenue or collect payment from marketer in particular period including result of the effect of the covid pandemic fluctuation in spending by our marketer due to seasonality such historically strong spending in the fourth quarter of each year episodic regional or global event including the covid pandemic or other factor the frequency prominence size format and quality of ad shown to user the success of technology designed to block the display of ad change to third party policy that limit our ability to deliver target or measure the effectiveness of advertising including change by mobile operating system and browser provider such apple and google the pricing of our ad and other product the diversification and growth of revenue source beyond advertising on facebook and instagram our ability to generate revenue from payment or the sale of our consumer hardware product or other product we may introduce in the future change to existing product or service or the development and introduction of new product or service by or our competitor of content user behavior or product change that may reduce traffic to feature or product that we successfully monetize increase in marketing sale and other operating expense that we will incur to grow and expand our operation and to remain competitive including cost related to our data center and technical infrastructure cost related to our privacy safety security and content review effort including result of implementing change to our practice whether voluntarily in connection with law regulation regulatory action or decision or recommendation from the independent oversight board or otherwise cost and expense related to the development manufacturing and delivery of our consumer hardware product our ability to maintain gross margin and operating margin cost related to acquisition including cost associated with amortization and additional investment to develop the acquired technology charge associated with impairment of any asset on our balance sheet our ability to obtain equipment component and labor for our data center and other technical infrastructure in timely and cost effective manner system failure or outage or government blocking which could prevent from serving ad for any period of time breach of security or privacy and the cost associated with any such breach and remediation change in the manner in which we distribute our product or inaccessibility of our product due to third party action fee paid to third party for content or the distribution of our product refund or other concession provided to advertiser share based compensation expense including acquisition related expense adverse litigation judgment settlement or other litigation related cost change in the legislative or regulatory environment including with respect to privacy data protection and content or action by government or regulator including fine order or consent decree the overall tax rate for our business which is affected by the mix of income we earn in the and in jurisdiction with different tax rate the effect of share based compensation the effect of integrating intellectual property from acquisition the effect of change in our business or structure and the effect of discrete item such legal and tax settlement and tax election the impact of change in tax law or judicial or regulatory interpretation of tax law which are recorded in the period such law are enacted or interpretation are issued and may significantly affect the effective tax rate of that period tax obligation that may arise from resolution of tax examination including the examination we are currently under by the internal revenue service irs that materially differ from the amount we have anticipated fluctuation in currency exchange rate and change in the proportion of our revenue and expense denominated in foreign currency trading activity in our share repurchase program of content fluctuation in the market value of our investment in marketable security in the valuation of our equity investment and in interest rate change in generally accepted accounting principle and change in regional or global business or macroeconomic condition including result of the covid pandemic which may impact the other factor described above our rate of growth may be volatile in the near term result of the covid pandemic and we expect they will decline over time in the future we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience volatility in our user and revenue growth rate result of the covid pandemic although we are unable to predict the duration or degree of such volatility with any certainty in the long term we expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time the size of our active user base increase and the size of our active user base may fluctuate or decline in one or more market particularly we achieve greater market penetration we also expect our revenue growth rate will continue to decline over time our revenue increase to higher level our growth rate experience volatility or decline investor perception of our business may be adversely affected and the trading price of our class common stock could decline our cost are continuing to grow and some of our investment particularly our investment in virtual and augmented reality have the effect of reducing our operating margin and profitability if our investment are not successful longer term our business and financial performance will be harmed operating our business is costly and we expect our expense to continue to increase in the future we broaden our user base user increase the amount and type of content they consume and the data they share with for example with respect to video we develop and implement new product we market new and existing product and promote our brand we continue to expand our technical infrastructure we continue to invest in new and unproven technology and we continue to hire additional employee and contractor to support our expanding operation including our effort to focus on privacy safety security and content review in addition from time to time we are subject to settlement judgment fine or other monetary penalty in connection with legal and regulatory development that may be material to our business we are also continuing to increase our investment in new platform and technology including we continue our effort related to building the metaverse some of these investment particularly our significant investment in virtual and augmented reality have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability and we expect the adverse financial impact of such investment to continue for the foreseeable future for example our investment in reality lab reduced our overall operating profit by approximately billion and we expect our investment to increase in future period if our investment are not successful longer term our business and financial performance will be harmed we plan to continue to make acquisition and pursue other strategic transaction which could impact our financial condition or result of operation and may adversely affect the price of our common stock part of our business strategy we have made and intend to continue to make acquisition to add specialized employee and complementary company product or technology and from time to time may enter into other strategic transaction such investment and joint venture we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidate and we may not be able to complete acquisition or other strategic transaction on favorable term or at all including result of regulatory challenge for example in the united kingdom competition and market authority issued an order directing to divest our giphy acquisition which we have appealed in some case the cost of such acquisition or other strategic transaction may be substantial and there is no assurance that we will realize expected synergy from future growth and potential monetization opportunity for our acquisition or favorable return on investment for our strategic investment we may pay substantial amount of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisition or other strategic transaction which ha occurred in the past and could adversely affect our liquidity the incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligation and increased interest expense and could also include covenant or other restriction that would impede our ability to manage our operation we may also issue equity security to pay for acquisition and we regularly grant rsus to retain the employee of acquired company which could increase our expense adversely affect our financial result and of contentsresult in dilution to our stockholder in addition any acquisition or other strategic transaction we announce could be viewed negatively by user marketer developer or investor which may adversely affect our business or the price of our class common stock we may also discover liability deficiency or other claim associated with the company or asset we acquire that were not identified in advance which may result in significant unanticipated cost the effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the result of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statement and disclosure made or action taken by the company we acquire or their representative well the limited amount of time in which acquisition are executed in addition we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition or other strategic transaction including tax and accounting charge acquisition or other strategic transaction may also result in our recording of significant additional expense to our result of operation and recording of substantial finite lived intangible asset on our balance sheet upon closing any of these factor may adversely affect our financial condition or result of operation we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisition and we incur significant cost to integrate and support the company we acquire the integration of acquisition requires significant time and resource particularly with respect to company that have significant operation or that develop product where we do not have prior experience and we may not manage these process successfully we continue to make substantial investment of resource to support our acquisition which ha in the past resulted and we expect will in the future result in significant ongoing operating expense and the diversion of resource and management attention from other area of our business we can not assure you that these investment will be successful if we fail to successfully integrate the company we acquire we may not realize the benefit expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed our business is dependent on our ability to maintain and scale our technical infrastructure and any significant disruption in our service including result of the covid pandemic could damage our reputation result in potential loss of user and engagement and adversely affect our financial result our reputation and ability to attract retain and serve our user is dependent upon the reliable performance of our product and our underlying technical infrastructure we have in the past experienced and may in the future experience interruption in the availability or performance of our product from time to time our system may not be adequately designed or may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary to avoid performance delay or outage that could be harmful to our business if our product are unavailable when user attempt to access them or if they do not load quickly expected user may not use our product often in the future or at all and our ability to serve ad may be disrupted any of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance we have experienced such issue to varying degree from time to time for example in october combination of an error and bug resulted in an approximately six hour outage of our service in addition the amount and type of information shared on our product continue to grow and evolve the usage pattern of our global community continue to evolve and our internal operational demand continue to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure including network capacity and computing power to continue to satisfy our need it is possible that we may fail to continue to effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure to accommodate these increased demand which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth in addition our business may be subject to interruption delay or failure resulting from earthquake adverse weather condition other natural disaster power loss terrorism geopolitical conflict other physical security threat cyber attack or other catastrophic event global climate change could result in certain type of natural disaster occurring more frequently or with more intense effect any such event may result in user being subject to service disruption or outage and we may not be able to recover our technical infrastructure and user data in timely manner to restart or provide our service which may adversely affect our financial result we also have been and may in the future be subject to increased energy or other cost to maintain the availability or performance of our product in connection with any such event in the increase in the use of our product result of the covid pandemic increased demand on our technical infrastructure we may not be able to accommodate any such demand in the future including result of our reduced data center operation and personnel working remotely during the pandemic substantial portion of our network infrastructure is provided by third party any disruption or failure in the service of contentswe receive from these provider could harm our ability to handle existing or increased traffic and could significantly harm our business any financial or other difficulty these provider face may adversely affect our business and we exercise little control over these provider which increase our vulnerability to problem with the service they provide due to the effect of the covid pandemic we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply and labor shortage and other disruption in logistics and the supply chain for our technical infrastructure result we have had to make certain change to our procurement practice and in the future we may not be able to procure sufficient component equipment or service from third party to satisfy our need or we may be required to procure such component equipment or service on unfavorable term any of these development may result in interruption in the availability or performance of our product require unfavorable change to existing product delay the introduction of future product or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial result we could experience unforeseen difficulty in building and operating key portion of our technical infrastructure we have designed and built our own data center and key portion of our technical infrastructure through which we serve our product and we plan to continue to significantly expand the size of our infrastructure primarily through data center subsea and terrestrial fiber optic cable system and other project the infrastructure expansion we are undertaking is complex and involves project in multiple location around the world including in emerging market that expose to increased risk relating to anti corruption compliance and political challenge among others we have in the past suspended and may in the future suspend certain of these project result of the covid pandemic additional unanticipated delay or disruption in the completion of these project including due to any shortage of labor necessary in building portion of such project or availability of component challenge in obtaining required government or regulatory approval or other geopolitical challenge or action by government whether result of the pandemic trade dispute or otherwise may lead to increased project cost operational inefficiency interruption in the delivery or degradation of the quality or reliability of our product or impairment of asset on our balance sheet in addition there may be issue related to this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phase of design and implementation which may only become evident we have started to fully utilize the underlying equipment that could further degrade the user experience or increase our cost further much of our technical infrastructure is located outside the united state and it is possible that action by foreign government or our response to such government action could result in the impairment of portion of our technical infrastructure which may interrupt the delivery or degrade the quality or reliability of our product and lead to negative user experience or increase our cost any of these event could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result real or perceived inaccuracy in our community and other metric may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business the number for our key metric which include our family metric dap map and average revenue per person arpp and facebook metric daus maus and average revenue per user arpu are calculated using internal company data based on the activity of user account while these number are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimate of our user base for the applicable period of measurement there are inherent challenge in measuring usage of our product across large online and mobile population around the world the methodology used to measure these metric require significant judgment and are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error in addition we are continually seeking to improve our estimate of our user base and such estimate may change due to improvement or change in our methodology we regularly review our process for calculating these metric and from time to time we discover inaccuracy in our metric or make adjustment to improve their accuracy which can result in adjustment to our historical metric our ability to recalculate our historical metric may be impacted by data limitation or other factor that require to apply different methodology for such adjustment we generally do not intend to update previously disclosed family metric for any such inaccuracy or adjustment that are within the error margin disclosed below in addition our family metric and facebook metric estimate will differ from estimate published by third party due to difference in methodology many people in our community have user account on more than one of our product and some people have multiple user account within an individual product accordingly for our family metric we do not seek to count the total number of user account across our product because we believe that would not reflect the actual size of our community rather our family metric represent our estimate of the number of unique people using at least one of facebook instagram messenger of contentsand whatsapp we do not require people to use common identifier or link their account to use multiple product in our family and therefore must seek to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people to calculate these metric we rely upon complex technique algorithm and machine learning model that seek to count the individual people behind user account including by matching multiple user account within an individual product and across multiple product when we believe they are attributable to single person and counting such group of account one person these technique and model require significant judgment are subject to data and other limitation discussed below and inherently are subject to statistical variance and uncertainty we estimate the potential error in our family metric primarily based on user survey data which itself is subject to error well while we expect the error margin for our family metric to vary from period to period we estimate that such margin generally will be approximately of our worldwide map at our scale it is very difficult to attribute multiple user account within and across product to individual people and it is possible that the actual number of unique people using our product may vary significantly from our estimate potentially beyond our estimated error margin result it is also possible that our family metric may indicate change or trend in user number that do not match actual change or trend to calculate our estimate of family dap and map we currently use series of machine learning model that are developed based on internal review of limited sample of user account and calibrated against user survey data we apply significant judgment in designing these model and calculating these estimate for example to match user account within individual product and across multiple product we use data signal such similar device information ip address and user name we also calibrate our model against data from periodic user survey of varying size and frequency across our product which are inherently subject to error the timing and result of such user survey have in the past contributed and may in the future contribute to change in our reported family metric from period to period in addition our data limitation may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business and increase the risk of error for our family metric estimate our technique and model rely on variety of data signal from different product and we rely on more limited data signal for some product compared to others for example result of limited visibility into encrypted product we have fewer data signal from whatsapp user account and primarily rely on phone number and device information to match whatsapp user account with account on our other product similarly although messenger kid user are included in our family metric we do not seek to match their account with account on our other application for purpose of calculating dap and map any loss of access to data signal we use in our process for calculating family metric whether result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our reported family metric well our ability to report these metric at all our estimate of family metric also may change our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology product change or other improvement in our user survey algorithm or machine learning that may improve our ability to match account within and across our product or otherwise evaluate the broad population of our user in addition such evolution may allow to identify previously undetected violating account defined below we regularly evaluate our family metric to estimate the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account we define violating account account which we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service including bot and spam in the fourth quarter of we estimated that approximately of our worldwide map consisted solely of violating account such estimation is based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example we look for account information and behavior associated with facebook and instagram account that appear to be inauthentic to the reviewer but we have limited visibility into whatsapp user activity due to encryption in addition if we believe an individual person ha one or more violating account we do not include such person in our violating account estimation long we believe they have one account that doe not constitute violating account from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of violating account among our user which may also reduce our dap and map estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the percentage of our map consisting solely of violating account on an annual basis violating account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of violating account may vary significantly from our estimate we also regularly evaluate our facebook metric to estimate the number of duplicate and false account among our maus duplicate account is one that user maintains in addition to his or her principal account we divide false account into two category user misclassified account where user have created personal profile for business organization or non human entity such pet such entity are permitted on facebook using page rather than personal profile under our term of service and violating account which represent user profile that we believe are intended to be used for purpose that violate our term of service such bot and spam the estimate of duplicate and false account of contentsare based on an internal review of limited sample of account and we apply significant judgment in making this determination for example to identify duplicate account we use data signal such identical ip address and similar user name and to identify false account we look for name that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewer any loss of access to data signal we use in this process whether result of our own product decision action by third party browser or mobile platform regulatory or legislative requirement limitation while our personnel work remotely during the covid pandemic or other factor also may impact the stability or accuracy of our estimate of duplicate and false account our estimate also may change our methodology evolve including through the application of new data signal or technology or product change that may allow to identify previously undetected duplicate or false account and may improve our ability to evaluate broader population of our user duplicate and false account are very difficult to measure at our scale and it is possible that the actual number of duplicate and false account may vary significantly from our estimate in the fourth quarter of we estimated that duplicate account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus we believe the percentage of duplicate account is meaningfully higher in developing market such the philippine and vietnam compared to more developed market in the fourth quarter of we estimated that false account may have represented approximately of our worldwide maus our estimation of false account can vary result of episodic spike in the creation of such account which we have seen originate more frequently in specific country such indonesia nigeria and vietnam from time to time we disable certain user account make product change or take other action to reduce the number of duplicate or false account among our user which may also reduce our dau and mau estimate in particular period we intend to disclose our estimate of the number of duplicate and false account among our maus on an annual basis other data limitation also may affect our understanding of certain detail of our business for example while user provided data indicates decline in usage among younger user this age data may be unreliable because disproportionate number of our younger user register with an inaccurate age accordingly our understanding of usage by age group may not be complete in addition our data regarding the geographic location of our user is estimated based on number of factor such the user ip address and self disclosed location these factor may not always accurately reflect the user actual location for example user may appear to be accessing facebook from the location of the proxy server that the user connects to rather than from the user actual location the methodology used to measure our metric are also susceptible to algorithm or other technical error and our estimate for revenue by user location and revenue by user device are also affected by these factor in addition from time to time we provide or rely on certain other metric and estimate including those relating to the reach and effectiveness of our ad many of our metric involve the use of estimation and judgment and our metric and estimate are subject to software bug inconsistency in our system and human error such metric and estimate also change from time to time due to improvement or change in our terminology or methodology including result of loss of access to data signal we use in calculating such metric and estimate we have in the past been and may in the future be subject to litigation well marketer regulatory and other inquiry regarding the accuracy of such metric and estimate where marketer developer or investor do not perceive our metric or estimate to be accurate or where we discover material inaccuracy in our metric or estimate we may be subject to liability our reputation may be harmed and marketer and developer may be le willing to allocate their budget or resource to our product that deliver ad impression which could negatively affect our business and financial result we can not assure you that we will effectively manage our growth our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased significantly with the number of employee increasing to of december from of december and we expect headcount growth to continue for the foreseeable future in addition we plan to continue to hire number of employee and contractor to continue to bolster various privacy safety security and content review initiative well other function to support our expected growth the growth and expansion of our business and product create significant challenge for our management operational and financial resource including managing multiple relationship with user marketer developer and other third party our operation and the number of our third party relationship continue to grow our information technology system or our internal control and procedure may not be adequate to support such growth in addition some member of our management do not have significant experience managing large global business operation so our management may not of contentsbe able to manage such growth effectively additionally the vast majority of our personnel are currently working remotely result of the covid pandemic which limit their ability to perform certain job function and may negatively impact productivity in the long term we may experience such challenge to productivity and collaboration some personnel transition to working remotely on regular basis and we may experience difficulty integrating recently hired personnel when our office open to effectively manage our growth we must continue to adapt to remote work environment improve our operational financial and management process and system and effectively expand train and manage our personnel our organization continues to grow and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structure we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefit of our corporate culture including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative product this could negatively affect our business performance we have significant international operation and plan to continue expanding our operation abroad where we have more limited operating experience and this may subject to increased business economic and legal risk that could affect our financial result we have significant international operation and plan to continue the international expansion of our business operation and the translation of our product we currently make facebook available in more than different language and we have office or data center in more than different country we may enter new international market where we have limited or no experience in marketing selling and deploying our product our product are generally available globally but some or all of our product or functionality may not be available in certain market due to legal and regulatory complexity for example several of our product are not generally available in china we also outsource certain operational function to third party vendor globally if we fail to deploy manage or oversee our international operation successfully our business may suffer in addition we are subject to variety of risk inherent in business internationally including political social or economic instability risk related to legal regulatory and other government scrutiny applicable to company with sale and operation in foreign jurisdiction including with respect to privacy tax law enforcement content trade compliance supply chain competition consumer protection intellectual property environmental health and safety licensing and infrastructure matter potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local law including potential censorship or requirement to provide user information to local authority enhanced difficulty in reviewing content on our platform and enforcing our community standard across different language and country fluctuation in currency exchange rate and compliance with currency control foreign exchange control and tax and other regulation and order that might prevent from repatriating cash earned in country outside the united state or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently higher level of credit risk and payment fraud enhanced difficulty of integrating any foreign acquisition burden of complying with variety of foreign law including law related to taxation content removal content moderation data localization data protection commerce and payment and regulatory oversight reduced protection for intellectual property right in some country difficulty in staffing managing and overseeing global operation and the increased travel infrastructure and legal compliance cost associated with multiple international location including difficulty arising from personnel working remotely during the covid pandemic compliance with statutory equity requirement and management of tax consequence of content geopolitical event affecting our marketer or our industry including trade dispute and pandemic in addition we must manage the potential conflict between locally accepted business practice in any given jurisdiction and our obligation to comply with law and regulation including anti corruption law or regulation applicable to such the foreign corrupt practice act and the bribery act we also must manage our obligation to comply with law and regulation related to import and export control trade restriction and sanction including regulation established by the office of foreign asset control government agency and authority have broad range of civil and criminal penalty they may seek to impose against company for violation of anti corruption law or regulation import and export control trade restriction sanction and other law rule and regulation if we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operation successfully our financial result could be adversely affected we also may be required to or elect to cease or modify our operation or the offering of our product and service in certain region including result of the risk described above which could adversely affect our business user growth and engagement and financial result we face design manufacturing and supply chain risk that if not properly managed could adversely impact our financial result we face number of risk related to design manufacturing and supply chain management with respect to our consumer hardware product for example the consumer hardware product we sell from time to time have had and in the future may have quality issue resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or from the software used in the product sometimes these issue may be caused by component we purchase from other manufacturer or supplier our brand and financial result could be adversely affected by any such quality issue other failure to meet our customer expectation or finding of our consumer hardware product to be defective we rely on third party to manufacture and manage the logistics of transporting and distributing our consumer hardware product which subject to number of risk that have been exacerbated result of the covid pandemic we have experienced and may in the future experience supply or labor shortage or other disruption in logistics and the supply chain which could result in shipping delay and negatively impact our operation product development and sale we could be negatively affected if we are not able to engage third party with the necessary capability or capacity on reasonable term or if those we engage with fail to meet their obligation whether due to financial difficulty manufacturing or supply constraint or other reason or make adverse change in the pricing or other material term of such arrangement with them the manufacturing distribution and sale of our consumer hardware product also may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic condition geopolitical challenge trade dispute or other action by government that subject to supply shortage increased cost or supply chain disruption we also require the supplier and business partner of our consumer hardware product to comply with law and certain company policy regarding sourcing practice and standard on labor health and safety the environment and business ethic but we do not control them or their practice and standard if any of them violates law fails to implement change in accordance with newly enacted law or implement practice or standard regarded unethical corrupt or non compliant we could experience supply chain disruption government action or fine canceled order or damage to our reputation we face inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware product we are exposed to inventory risk with respect to our consumer hardware product result of rapid change in product cycle and pricing unsafe or defective merchandise supply chain disruption change in consumer demand and consumer spending pattern change in consumer taste with respect to our consumer hardware product and other factor the demand for our product can also change significantly between the time inventory or component are ordered and the date of sale while we endeavor to accurately predict these trend and avoid overstocking or understocking consumer hardware product we may sell from time to time we have experienced difficulty in accurately predicting and meeting the consumer demand for our product in addition when we begin selling or manufacturing new consumer hardware product or enter new international market it may be difficult to establish vendor relationship determine appropriate product or component selection and accurately forecast demand the acquisition of certain type of inventory or component may require significant lead time and prepayment and they may not be returnable any one of the foregoing factor may adversely of contentsaffect our operating result we are involved in numerous class action lawsuit and other litigation matter that are expensive and time consuming and if resolved adversely could harm our business financial condition or result of operation we are involved in numerous lawsuit including stockholder derivative lawsuit and putative class action lawsuit many of which claim statutory damage and or seek significant change to our business operation and we anticipate that we will continue to be target for numerous lawsuit in the future because of the scale of our user advertiser and developer base the plaintiff in class action case filed against typically claim enormous monetary damage even if the alleged per user or entity harm is small or non existent in addition we have in the past and may in the future be subject to additional class action lawsuit based on claim related to advertising antitrust privacy biometrics content algorithm employment activity on our platform consumer protection or product performance or other claim related to the use of consumer hardware and software including virtual reality technology and product which are new and unproven for example we are currently the subject of multiple putative class action suit in connection with our platform and user data practice and the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy the disclosure of our earnings result for the second quarter of our acquisition of instagram and whatsapp well other alleged anticompetitive conduct and former employee allegation and release of internal company document beginning in september the result of any such lawsuit and claim can not be predicted with certainty and any negative outcome from any such lawsuit could result in payment of substantial monetary damage or fine or undesirable change to our product or business practice and accordingly our business financial condition or result of operation could be materially and adversely affected there can be no assurance that favorable final outcome will be obtained in all our case and defending any lawsuit is costly and can impose significant burden on management and employee any litigation to which we are party may result in an onerous or unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payment of substantial monetary damage or fine or we may decide to settle lawsuit on similarly unfavorable term which ha occurred in the past and which could adversely affect our business financial condition or result of operation we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liability our tax obligation including income and non income tax are based in part on our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangement including the manner in which we operate our business develop value manage protect and use our intellectual property and the valuation of our intercompany transaction the tax law applicable to our business including the law of the united state and other jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and certain jurisdiction are aggressively interpreting their law in new way in an effort to raise additional tax revenue from company such meta we are subject to regular review and audit by federal state and foreign tax authority tax authority may disagree with certain position we have taken including our methodology for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangement and any adverse outcome of such review or audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow for example in and the irs issued formal assessment relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the through tax year although we disagree with the irs position and are litigating this issue the ultimate resolution is uncertain and if resolved in manner unfavorable to may adversely affect our financial result the determination of our worldwide provision for income tax and other tax liability requires significant judgment by management and there are many transaction where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain our provision for income tax is determined by the manner in which we operate our business and any change to such operation or law applicable to such operation may affect our effective tax rate although we believe that our provision for income tax and estimate of our non income tax liability are reasonable the ultimate settlement may differ from the amount recorded in our financial statement and may materially affect our financial result in the period or period for which such determination is made our future income tax rate could be volatile and difficult to predict due to change in jurisdictional profit split change in the amount and recognition of deferred tax asset and liability or by change in tax law regulation or accounting principle of contentschanges in tax law or tax ruling could materially affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow the tax regime we are subject to or operate under including income and non income tax are unsettled and may be subject to significant change change in tax law or tax ruling or change in interpretation of existing law could materially affect our financial position result of operation and cash flow for example the tax cut and job act tax act enacted in december had significant impact on our tax obligation and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of the issuance of additional regulatory or accounting guidance related to the tax act or other executive or congressional action in the united state or globally could materially increase our tax obligation and significantly impact our effective tax rate in the period such guidance is issued or such action take effect and in future period in addition many country have recently proposed or recommended change to existing tax law or have enacted new law that could significantly increase our tax obligation in many country where we do business or require to change the manner in which we operate our business over the last several year the organization for economic cooperation and development ha been working on base erosion and profit shifting project that if implemented would change various aspect of the existing framework under which our tax obligation are determined in many of the country in which we do business in more than country tentatively signed on to framework that imposes minimum tax rate of among other provision this framework is subject to further negotiation and implementation by each member country the timing and ultimate impact of any such change on our tax obligation are uncertain similarly the european commission and several country have issued proposal that would apply to various aspect of the current tax framework under which we are taxed these proposal include change to the existing framework to calculate income tax well proposal to change or impose new type of non income tax including tax based on percentage of revenue for example several jurisdiction have proposed or enacted tax applicable to digital service which include business activity on digital advertising and online marketplace and which apply to our business the european commission ha conducted investigation in multiple country focusing on whether local country tax ruling or tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates european union state aid rule and concluded that certain member state including ireland have provided illegal state aid in certain case these investigation may result in change to the tax treatment of our foreign operation due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activity many of these type of change to the taxation of our activity described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate increase the amount of non income tax imposed on our business and harm our financial position result of operation and cash flow such change may also apply retroactively to our historical operation and result in tax greater than the amount estimated and recorded in our financial statement given our level of share based compensation our tax rate may vary significantly depending on our stock price the tax effect of the accounting for share based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period to period in period in which our stock price is higher than the grant price of the share based compensation vesting in that period we will recognize excess tax benefit that will decrease our effective tax rate for example in excess tax benefit recognized from share based compensation decreased our provision for income tax by billion and our effective tax rate by two percentage point compared to the tax rate without such benefit in future period in which our stock price is lower than the grant price of the share based compensation vesting in that period our effective tax rate may increase the amount and value of share based compensation issued relative to our earnings in particular period will also affect the magnitude of the impact of share based compensation on our effective tax rate these tax effect are dependent on our stock price which we do not control and decline in our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial result if our goodwill or intangible asset become impaired we may be required to record significant charge to earnings we review our intangible asset for impairment when event or change in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable such decline in stock price and market capitalization we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually if such goodwill or intangible asset are deemed to be impaired an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset would be recognized we may be required to record significant charge in our financial statement during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill of contentsor intangible asset is determined which would negatively affect our result of operation the loss of one or more of our key personnel or our failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could harm our business we currently depend on the continued service and performance of our key personnel including mark zuckerberg and sheryl sandberg although we have entered into employment agreement with mr zuckerberg and sandberg the agreement have no specific duration and constitute at will employment in addition many of our key technology and system are custom made for our business by our personnel the loss of key personnel including member of management well key engineering product development marketing and sale personnel could disrupt our operation and have an adverse effect on our business we continue to grow we can not guarantee we will continue to attract and retain the personnel we need to maintain our competitive position in particular we intend to continue to hire significant number of technical personnel in the foreseeable future and we expect to continue to face significant challenge in hiring such personnel particularly for engineering talent whether result of competition with other company or other factor we continue to mature the incentive to attract retain and motivate employee provided by our equity award or by future arrangement may not be effective in the past and if we issue significant equity to attract additional employee or to retain our existing employee we would incur substantial additional share based compensation expense and the ownership of our existing stockholder would be further diluted our ability to attract retain and motivate employee may also be adversely affected by stock price volatility in addition restrictive immigration policy or legal or regulatory development relating to immigration may negatively affect our effort to attract and hire new personnel well retain our existing personnel if we do not succeed in attracting hiring and integrating excellent personnel or retaining and motivating existing personnel we may be unable to grow effectively our ceo ha control over key decision making result of his control of majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock mark zuckerberg our founder chairman and ceo is able to exercise voting right with respect to majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock and therefore ha the ability to control the outcome of matter submitted to our stockholder for approval including the election of director and any merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our asset this concentrated control could delay defer or prevent change of control merger consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our asset that our other stockholder support or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such transaction that our other stockholder do not support this concentrated control could also discourage potential investor from acquiring our class common stock which ha limited voting power relative to the class common stock and might harm the trading price of our class common stock in addition mr zuckerberg ha the ability to control the management and major strategic investment of our company result of his position our ceo and his ability to control the election or in some case the replacement of our director in the event of his death the share of our capital stock that mr zuckerberg owns will be transferred to the person or entity that ha designated board member and officer mr zuckerberg owes fiduciary duty to our stockholder and must act in good faith in manner he reasonably belief to be in the best interest of our stockholder stockholder even controlling stockholder mr zuckerberg is entitled to vote his share and share over which he ha voting control governed by voting agreement in his own interest which may not always be in the interest of our stockholder generally we can not guarantee that our share repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long term stockholder value share repurchase could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and will diminish our cash reserve although our board of director ha authorized share repurchase program that doe not have an expiration date the program doe not obligate to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of share of our class common stock we can not guarantee that the program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long term stockholder value the program could affect the trading price of our stock and increase volatility and any announcement of termination of this program may result in decrease in the trading price of our stock in addition this program will diminish our cash reserve of contentsrisks related to government regulation and enforcementactions by government that restrict access to facebook or our other product in their country censor or moderate content on our product in their country or otherwise impair our ability to sell advertising in their country could substantially harm our business and financial result government from time to time seek to censor or moderate content available on facebook or our other product in their country restrict access to our product from their country partially or entirely or impose other restriction that may affect the accessibility of our product in their country for an extended period of time or indefinitely for example user access to facebook and certain of our other product ha been or is currently restricted in whole or in part in china iran and north korea in addition government authority in other country may seek to restrict user access to our product if they consider to be in violation of their law or threat to public safety or for other reason and certain of our product have been restricted by government in other country from time to time for example in june hong kong adopted national security law that provides authority with the ability to obtain information remove and block access to content and suspend user service and if we are found to be in violation of this law the use of our product may be restricted in addition if we are required to or elect to make change to our marketing and sale or other operation in hong kong result of the national security law our revenue and business in the region will be adversely affected it is also possible that government authority could take action that impairs our ability to sell advertising including in country where access to our consumer facing product may be blocked or restricted for example we generate meaningful revenue from limited number of resellers representing advertiser based in china and it is possible that the chinese government could take action that reduces or eliminates our china based advertising revenue whether result of the trade dispute with the united state in response to content issue or information request in hong kong or elsewhere or for other reason or take other action against such imposing tax or other penalty which could adversely affect our financial result similarly if we are found to be out of compliance with certain legal requirement for social medium company in turkey the turkish government could take action to reduce or eliminate our turkey based advertising revenue or otherwise adversely impact access to our product in the event that content shown on facebook or our other product is subject to censorship access to our product is restricted in whole or in part in one or more country we are required to or elect to make change to our operation or other restriction are imposed on our product or our competitor are able to successfully penetrate new geographic market or capture greater share of existing geographic market that we can not access or where we face other restriction our ability to retain or increase our user base user engagement or the level of advertising by marketer may be adversely affected we may not be able to maintain or grow our revenue anticipated and our financial result could be adversely affected our business is subject to complex and evolving and foreign law and regulation regarding privacy data use and data protection content competition safety and consumer protection commerce and other matter many of these law and regulation are subject to change and uncertain interpretation and could result in claim change to our product and business practice monetary penalty increased cost of operation or decline in user growth or engagement or otherwise harm our business we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad that involve matter central to our business including privacy data use data protection and personal information biometrics encryption right of publicity content intellectual property advertising marketing distribution data security data retention and deletion data localization and storage data disclosure artificial intelligence electronic contract and other communication competition protection of minor consumer protection civil right telecommunication product liability commerce taxation economic or other trade control including sanction anti corruption and political law compliance security law compliance and online payment service the introduction of new product expansion of our activity in certain jurisdiction or other action that we may take may subject to additional law regulation or other government scrutiny in addition foreign data protection privacy content competition consumer protection and other law and regulation can impose different obligation or be more restrictive than those in the united state these federal and state and foreign law and regulation which in some case can be enforced by private party in addition to government entity are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change result the application interpretation and enforcement of these law and regulation are often uncertain particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policy and practice for example regulatory or legislative action affecting the manner in which we display content to our user or obtain consent to various practice could adversely affect user growth and engagement such action could affect the manner in which we provide our service or adversely affect our financial result of contentswe are also subject to evolving law and regulation that dictate whether how and under what circumstance we can transfer process and or receive certain data that is critical to our operation including data shared between country or region in which we operate and data shared among our product and service for example in the european union and united state agreed to transfer framework for data transferred from the european union to the united state called the privacy shield but the privacy shield wa invalidated in july by the court of justice of the european union cjeu in addition the other base upon which meta relies to transfer such data such standard contractual clause sccs have been subjected to regulatory and judicial scrutiny for example the cjeu considered the validity of sccs basis to transfer user data from the european union to the united state following challenge brought by the irish data protection commission idpc although the cjeu upheld the validity of sccs in july our continued reliance on sccs will be the subject of future regulatory consideration in particular in august we received preliminary draft decision from the idpc that preliminarily concluded that meta platform ireland reliance on sccs in respect of european user data doe not achieve compliance with the gdpr and preliminarily proposed that such transfer of user data from the european union to the united state should therefore be suspended meta platform ireland challenged procedural aspect of this idpc inquiry in judicial review commenced in the irish high court in september in may the court rejected meta platform ireland procedural challenge and the inquiry subsequently recommenced we believe final decision in this inquiry may issue early the first half of if new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or rely upon other alternative mean of data transfer from europe to the united state we will likely be unable to offer number of our most significant product and service including facebook and instagram in europe which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and result of operation in addition we have been managing investigation and lawsuit in europe india and other jurisdiction regarding the august update to whatsapp term of service and privacy policy and it sharing of certain data with other meta product and service including lawsuit currently pending the supreme court of india and also became subject to government inquiry and lawsuit regarding the update to whatsapp term of service and privacy policy if we are unable to transfer data between and among country and region in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our product and service it could affect our ability to provide our service the manner in which we provide our service or our ability to target ad which could adversely affect our financial result we have been subject to other significant legislative and regulatory development in the past and proposed or new legislation and regulation could significantly affect our business in the future for example we have implemented number of product change and control result of requirement under the european general data protection regulation gdpr and may implement additional change in the future the gdpr also requires submission of personal data breach notification to our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc and includes significant penalty for non compliance with the notification obligation well other requirement of the regulation the gdpr is still relatively new law it interpretation is still evolving and draft decision in investigation by the idpc are subject to review by other european privacy regulator part of the gdpr consistency mechanism which may lead to significant change in the final outcome of such investigation result the interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr well the imposition and amount of penalty for non compliance are subject to significant uncertainty in addition brazil the united kingdom and other country have enacted similar data protection regulation imposing data privacy related requirement on product and service offered to user in their respective jurisdiction the california consumer privacy act ccpa which took effect in january and it successor the california privacy right act cpra which will take effect in january also establish certain transparency rule and create new data privacy right for user including limitation on our use of certain sensitive personal information and more ability for user to control how their data is shared with third party these law and regulation are evolving and subject to interpretation and resulting limitation on our advertising service or reduction of advertising by marketer have to some extent adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect our advertising business for example regulator continue to issue guidance concerning the eprivacy directive requirement regarding the use of cooky and similar technology in addition effective december the eprivacy directive includes additional limitation on the use of data across messaging product and includes significant penalty for non compliance change to our product or business practice result of these or similar development may adversely affect our advertising business similarly there are number of legislative proposal in the european union the united state at both the federal and state level well other jurisdiction that could impose new obligation or limitation in area affecting our business for example the proposed digital market act in the european union and pending proposal to modify competition law in the united state and other jurisdiction could cause to incur significant compliance cost and could potentially impose new restriction and requirement on company like ours including in area such the combination of data across service merger and acquisition and product design in addition some country such india are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirement or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar of contentsrequirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our service new legislation or regulatory decision that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minor may also result in limitation on our advertising service or our ability to offer product and service to minor in certain jurisdiction these law and regulation well any associated claim inquiry or investigation or any other government action have in the past led to and may in the future lead to unfavorable outcome including increased compliance cost delay or impediment in the development of new product negative publicity and reputational harm increased operating cost diversion of management time and attention and remedy that harm our business including fine or demand or order that we modify or cease existing business practice we have been subject to regulatory and other government investigation enforcement action and settlement and we expect to continue to be subject to such proceeding and other inquiry in the future which could cause to incur substantial cost or require to change our business practice in manner materially adverse to our business we receive formal and informal inquiry from government authority and regulator regarding our compliance with law and regulation many of which are evolving and subject to interpretation we are and expect to continue to be the subject of investigation inquiry data request request for information action and audit in the united state europe and around the world particularly in the area of privacy data protection law enforcement consumer protection civil right content moderation and competition we continue to grow and expand our operation in addition we are currently and may in the future be subject to regulatory order or consent decree for example data protection competition and consumer protection authority in the european union and other jurisdiction have initiated action investigation or administrative order seeking to restrict the way in which we collect and use information or impose sanction and other authority may do the same in addition beginning in march we became subject to ftc state attorney general and other government inquiry in the united state europe and other jurisdiction in connection with our platform and user data practice well the misuse of certain data by developer that shared such data with third party in violation of our term and policy in july we entered into settlement and modified consent order to resolve the ftc inquiry which wa approved by the federal court and took effect in april among other matter our settlement with the ftc required to pay penalty of billion and to significantly enhance our practice and process for privacy compliance and oversight the state attorney general inquiry and certain government inquiry in other jurisdiction remain ongoing beginning in september we also became subject to idpc and other government inquiry in connection with third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook we also notify the idpc our lead european union privacy regulator under the gdpr of certain other personal data breach and privacy issue and are subject to inquiry and investigation by the idpc and other european regulator regarding various aspect of our regulatory compliance in addition we are subject to various litigation and formal and informal inquiry and investigation by competition authority in the united state europe and other jurisdiction which relate to many aspect of our business including with respect to user and advertiser well our industry such inquiry investigation and lawsuit concern among other thing our business practice in the area of social networking or social medium service digital advertising and or mobile or online application well our acquisition for example in june we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company in addition beginning in the third quarter of we became the subject of antitrust inquiry and investigation by the department of justice and state attorney general beginning in december we also became subject to lawsuit by the ftc and the attorney general from state the territory of guam and the district of columbia in the district court for the district of columbia alleging that we violated antitrust law including by acquiring instagram in and whatsapp in and by maintaining condition on access to our platform among other thing the complaint of the ftc and attorney general both sought permanent injunction against our company alleged violation of the antitrust law and other equitable relief including divestiture or reconstruction of instagram and whatsapp we are also subject to other government inquiry and investigation relating to our business activity and disclosure practice for example beginning in september we became subject to government investigation and request relating to allegation and the release of internal company document by former employee order issued by or inquiry or enforcement action initiated by government or regulatory authority could cause to incur substantial cost expose to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalty including substantial monetary remedy interrupt or require to change our business practice in manner materially adverse to our business result in negative publicity and reputational harm divert resource and the time and attention of management from our business or subject to other structural or behavioral remedy that adversely affect our business and we have experienced some of of contentsthese adverse effect to varying degree from time to time compliance with our ftc consent order the gdpr the ccpa the eprivacy directive and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirement require significant operational resource and modification to our business practice and any compliance failure may have material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial result we are engaged in ongoing privacy compliance and oversight effort including in connection with our modified consent order with the ftc requirement of the gdpr and other regulatory and legislative requirement around the world such the ccpa and the eprivacy directive in particular we are maintaining comprehensive privacy program in connection with the ftc consent order that includes substantial management and board of director oversight stringent operational requirement and reporting obligation prohibition against making misrepresentation relating to user data process to regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program to the ftc and regular assessment of our privacy program by an independent third party assessor which ha been and will continue to be challenging and costly to maintain and enhance these compliance and oversight effort are increasing demand on our system and resource and require significant new and ongoing investment including investment in compliance process personnel and technical infrastructure we are reallocating resource internally to assist with these effort and this ha had and will continue to have an adverse impact on our other business initiative in addition these effort require substantial modification to our business practice and make some practice such product and ad development more difficult time consuming and costly result we believe our ability to develop and launch new feature product and service in timely manner ha been and will continue to be adversely affected we also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight effort will require significant time and attention from our management and board of director the requirement of the ftc consent order and other privacy related law and regulation are complex and apply broadly to our business and from time to time we notify relevant authority of instance where we are not in full compliance with these requirement or otherwise discover privacy issue and we expect to continue to do so any such issue arise in the future in addition regulatory and legislative privacy requirement are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change and uncertain interpretation if we are unable to successfully implement and comply with the mandate of the ftc consent order gdpr ccpa eprivacy directive or other regulatory or legislative requirement or if we are found to be in violation of the consent order or other applicable requirement we may be subject to regulatory or governmental investigation or lawsuit which may result in significant monetary fine judgment or other penalty and we may also be required to make additional change to our business practice any of these event could have material adverse effect on our business reputation and financial result we may incur liability result of information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet or published using our product or result of claim related to our product and legislation regulating content on our platform may require to change our product or business practice and may adversely affect our business and financial result we have faced currently face and will continue to face claim relating to information or content that is published or made available on our product including our policy and enforcement action with respect to such information or content in particular the nature of our business expose to claim related to defamation dissemination of misinformation or news hoax discrimination harassment intellectual property right right of publicity and privacy personal injury tort law regulating hate speech or other type of content online safety consumer protection and breach of contract among others this risk is enhanced in certain jurisdiction outside the united state where our protection from liability for third party action may be unclear or where we may be le protected under local law than we are in the united state for example in april the european union passed directive the european copyright directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain us of news content online which member state are currently implementing into their national law in addition the european union revised the european audiovisual medium service directive to apply to online video sharing platform which member state are expected to implement by in the united state there have been and continue to be various legislative and executive effort to remove or restrict the scope of the protection available to online platform under section of the communication decency act well to impose new obligation on online platform with respect to commerce listing user content counterfeit good and copyright infringing material and our current protection from liability for third party content in the united state could decrease or change we could incur significant cost investigating and defending such claim and if we are found liable significant damage we could also face fine order restricting or blocking our service in particular geography or other government imposed remedy result of content hosted on our service for example legislation in germany and india ha resulted in the past and may result in the future in the imposition of fine or other penalty for failure to comply with certain content removal law enforcement cooperation and disclosure obligation numerous other country in europe the middle east asia pacific and latin america are considering or have implemented similar legislation imposing potentially significant penalty including fine of contentsservice throttling or advertising ban for failure to remove certain type of content or follow certain process for example we have been subject to fine and may in the future be subject to other penalty in connection with social medium legislation in russia and turkey content related legislation also ha required in the past and may require in the future to change our product or business practice increase our cost or otherwise impact our operation or our ability to provide service in certain geography for example the european copyright directive requires certain online service to obtain authorization for copyrighted content or to implement measure to prevent the availability of that content which may require to make substantial investment in compliance process member state law implementing the european copyright directive may also require online platform to pay for content in addition our compliance cost may significantly increase result of the digital service act proposed in the european union which is expected to take effect in and other content related legislative development such online safety bill in ireland and the united kingdom in the united state change to section of the communication decency act or new state or federal content related legislation may increase our cost or require significant change to our product business practice or operation which could adversely affect user growth and engagement any of the foregoing event could adversely affect our business and financial result payment transaction may subject to additional regulatory requirement and other risk that could be costly and difficult to comply with or that could harm our business several of our product offer payment functionality including enabling our user to purchase virtual and digital good from developer that offer application using our payment infrastructure send money to other user and make donation to certain charitable organization among other activity we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state europe and elsewhere including those governing anti money laundering and counter terrorist financing money transmission stored value gift card and other prepaid access instrument electronic fund transfer virtual currency consumer protection charitable fundraising trade sanction and import and export restriction depending on how our payment product evolve we may also be subject to other law and regulation including those governing gambling banking and lending in some jurisdiction the application or interpretation of these law and regulation is not clear to increase flexibility in how our use of payment may evolve and to mitigate regulatory uncertainty we have received certain payment license in the united state the european economic area and other jurisdiction which will generally require to demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign law in these area our effort to comply with these law and regulation could be costly and result in diversion of management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance in the event that we are found to be in violation of any such legal or regulatory requirement we may be subject to monetary fine or other penalty such cease and desist order or we may be required to make product change any of which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial result in addition we are subject to variety of additional risk result of payment transaction including increased cost and diversion of management time and effort and other resource to deal with bad transaction or customer dispute potential fraudulent or otherwise illegal activity by user developer employee or third party restriction on the investment of consumer fund used to transact payment and additional disclosure and reporting requirement we have also launched certain payment functionality on whatsapp and have announced plan to develop digital payment product and service which may subject to many of the foregoing risk and additional licensing requirement our digital payment initiative subject to significant regulatory scrutiny and other risk that could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result we are pursuing digital payment initiative such novi digital wallet that we expect to offer both standalone application and subsequently integrated in other meta product these initiative may use blockchain based asset such the usdp stablecoin issued by paxos trust company which is being used in novi pilot program in the united state and guatemala beginning in october our future initiative to support commerce in the metaverse also may use blockchain based asset in digital payment use of blockchain based asset in payment are relatively new and unproven technology and the law and regulation surrounding them are uncertain and evolving these digital payment effort have drawn significant scrutiny from government and regulator in multiple jurisdiction and we expect that scrutiny to continue we are participating in response to inquiry from government and regulator related to our digital payment initiative and adverse government or regulatory action or negative publicity resulting from such participation may adversely affect our reputation and harm our business our digital payment initiative evolve we may be subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and international jurisdiction including those governing payment financial service virtual currency anti money of contentslaundering counter terrorism financing trade sanction data protection tax consumer protection and competition in many jurisdiction the application or interpretation of these law and regulation is not clear particularly with respect to evolving law and regulation that are applied to blockchain and digital payment in addition novi ha also received state money transmitter license in the united state with more pending approval and ha other financial service license application pending in certain other country that would allow to conduct digital wallet activity in those country these license law and regulation well any associated inquiry or investigation may delay or impede the development of digital payment product and service we offer increase our operating cost require significant management time and attention or otherwise harm our business in addition market acceptance of digital payment product and service is subject to significant uncertainty such there can be no assurance that digital payment product and service we offer will be made available in timely manner or at all we do not have significant prior experience with blockchain based technology which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market such digital payment product and service we will also incur increased cost in connection with these effort and our investment may not be successful any of these event could adversely affect our business reputation or financial result risk related to data security and intellectual propertysecurity breach improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data other hacking and phishing attack on our system or other cyber incident could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business our industry is prone to cyber attack by third party seeking unauthorized access to our data or user data or to disrupt our ability to provide service our product and service involve the collection storage processing and transmission of large amount of data any failure to prevent or mitigate security breach and improper access to or disclosure of our data or user data including personal information content or payment information from user or information from marketer could result in the loss modification disclosure destruction or other misuse of such data which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position in addition computer malware virus social engineering such spear phishing attack scraping and general hacking continue to be prevalent in our industry have occurred on our system in the past and will occur on our system in the future we also regularly encounter attempt to create false or undesirable user account purchase ad or take other action on our platform for purpose such spamming spreading misinformation or other objectionable end result of our prominence the size of our user base the type and volume of personal data and content on our system and the evolving nature of our product and service including our effort involving new and emerging technology we believe that we are particularly attractive target for such breach and attack including from nation state and highly sophisticated state sponsored or otherwise well funded actor our effort to address undesirable activity on our platform also increase the risk of retaliatory attack such breach and attack may cause interruption to the service we provide degrade the user experience cause user or marketer to lose confidence and trust in our product impair our internal system or result in financial harm to our effort to protect our company data or the information we receive and to disable undesirable activity on our platform may also be unsuccessful due to software bug or other technical malfunction employee contractor or vendor error or malfeasance including defect or vulnerability in our vendor information technology system or offering government surveillance breach of physical security of our facility or technical infrastructure or other threat that evolve in addition third party may attempt to fraudulently induce employee or user to disclose information in order to gain access to our data or our user data cyber attack continue to evolve in sophistication and volume and inherently may be difficult to detect for long period of time although we have developed system and process that are designed to protect our data and user data to prevent data loss to disable undesirable account and activity on our platform and to prevent or detect security breach we can not assure you that such measure will provide absolute security that we will be able to react in timely manner or that our remediation effort will be successful the change in our work environment result of the covid pandemic could also impact the security of our system well our ability to protect against attack and detect and respond to them quickly in addition some of our developer or other partner such those that help measure the effectiveness of ad may receive or store information provided by or by our user through mobile or web application integrated with our product we provide limited information to such third party based on the scope of service provided to however if these third party or developer fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practice or in the event of breach of their network our data or our user data may be improperly accessed used or disclosed we experience such cyber attack and other security incident of varying degree from time to time and we incur of contentssignificant cost in protecting against or remediating such incident in addition we are subject to variety of law and regulation in the united state and abroad relating to cybersecurity and data protection well obligation under our modified consent order with the ftc result affected user or government authority could initiate legal or regulatory action against in connection with any actual or perceived security breach or improper access to or disclosure of data which ha occurred in the past and which could cause to incur significant expense and liability or result in order or consent decree forcing to modify our business practice such incident or our effort to remediate such incident may also result in decline in our active user base or engagement level any of these event could have material and adverse effect on our business reputation or financial result for example in september we announced our discovery of third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token which were then used to access certain profile information from approximately million user account on facebook the event surrounding this cyber attack became the subject of irish data protection commission and other government inquiry any such inquiry could subject to substantial fine and cost require to change our business practice divert resource and the attention of management from our business or adversely affect our business we anticipate that our ongoing effort related to privacy safety security and content review will identify additional instance of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party on our platform in addition to our effort to mitigate cybersecurity risk we are making significant investment in privacy safety security and content review effort to combat misuse of our service and user data by third party including investigation and audit of platform application well other enforcement effort result of these effort we have discovered and announced and anticipate that we will continue to discover and announce additional incident of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third party we may not discover all such incident or activity whether result of our data or technical limitation including our lack of visibility over our encrypted service the scale of activity on our platform challenge related to our personnel working remotely during the covid pandemic the allocation of resource to other project or other factor and we may be notified of such incident or activity by the independent privacy assessor required under our modified consent order with the ftc the medium or other third party such incident and activity have in the past and may in the future include the use of user data or our system in manner inconsistent with our term contract or policy the existence of false or undesirable user account election interference improper advertising practice activity that threaten people safety on or offline or instance of spamming scraping data harvesting unsecured datasets or spreading misinformation we may also be unsuccessful in our effort to enforce our policy or otherwise remediate any such incident consequence of any of the foregoing development include negative effect on user trust and engagement harm to our reputation and brand change to our business practice in manner adverse to our business and adverse effect on our business and financial result any such development may also subject to additional litigation and regulatory inquiry which could subject to monetary penalty and damage divert management time and attention and lead to enhanced regulatory oversight our product and internal system rely on software and hardware that is highly technical and any error bug or vulnerability in these system or failure to address or mitigate technical limitation in our system could adversely affect our business our product and internal system rely on software and hardware including software and hardware developed or maintained internally and or by third party that is highly technical and complex in addition our product and internal system depend on the ability of such software and hardware to store retrieve process and manage immense amount of data the software and hardware on which we rely ha contained and will in the future contain error bug or vulnerability and our system are subject to certain technical limitation that may compromise our ability to meet our objective some error bug or vulnerability inherently may be difficult to detect and may only be discovered after the code ha been released for external or internal use for example in september we announced our discovery of third party cyber attack that exploited vulnerability in facebook code to steal user access token and access certain profile information from user account on facebook error bug vulnerability design defect or technical limitation within the software and hardware on which we rely or human error in using such system have in the past led to and may in the future lead to outcome including negative experience for user and marketer who use our product compromised ability of our product to perform in manner consistent with our term contract or policy delayed product introduction

affect our business and financial result if we are unable to protect our intellectual property the value of our brand and other intangible asset may be diminished and our business may be adversely affected we rely and expect to continue to rely on combination of confidentiality assignment and license agreement with our employee consultant and third party with we have relationship well trademark copyright patent trade secret and domain name protection law to protect our proprietary right in the united state and internationally we have filed various application for protection of certain aspect of our intellectual property and we currently hold significant number of registered trademark and issued patent in multiple jurisdiction and have acquired patent and patent application from third party third party may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary right third party may challenge proprietary right held by and pending and future trademark and patent application may not be

required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our right although we have generally taken measure to protect our proprietary right there can be no

patent holder and other party alleging that certain of our product and service or user content infringe their intellectual property right we presently are involved in number of intellectual property lawsuit and we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile we expect the number of patent and other intellectual property claim against to grow defending patent and other intellectual property litigation is costly and can impose significant burden on management and employee and there can be no assurance that favorable final outcome will be obtained in all case in

tool arising from change to the regulatory environment and third party mobile operating system and browser our business and result of operation have also been impacted by the covid pandemic and the preventative measure implemented by authority from time to time to help limit the spread of the illness which have caused and are continuing to cause business slowdown or shutdown in certain affected country and region beginning in the first quarter of we experienced significant increase in the size and engagement of our active user base across number of region result of the covid pandemic more recently we have seen these pandemic related trend subside particularly in certain developed market we are unable to predict the impact of the pandemic on user growth and engagement with any certainty and these trend may continue to be subject to volatility the covid pandemic ha also had varied impact on the demand for and pricing of our ad from period to period while we experienced reduction in demand and related decline in pricing during the onset of the pandemic we believe the pandemic subsequently contributed to an acceleration in the growth of online commerce particularly during the second half of and we experienced increasing demand for advertising result of this trend more recently we believe this growth ha moderated in many region which to some extent adversely affected our advertising revenue growth in the second half of we may experience reduced advertising demand and related decline in pricing in future period to the extent this trend continues which could adversely affect our advertising revenue growth however the impact of the of contentspandemic on user growth and engagement the demand for and pricing of our advertising service well on our overall result of operation remains highly uncertain for the foreseeable future user growth and engagement were also impacted by number of other factor in the second half of for example competitive product and service have reduced some user engagement with our product and service and in response to competitive pressure we have introduced new feature such reel which is growing in usage but is not currently monetized at the same rate our feed or story product we also saw deceleration in our community growth rate the size of our community continued to increase in addition we experienced year over year decline in ad impression delivered in the united state canada region these trend adversely affected advertising revenue growth in the second half of and we expect will continue to affect our advertising revenue growth in the foreseeable future other global and regional business and macroeconomic condition also have had and we believe will continue to have an impact on our user growth and engagement and advertising revenue growth we anticipate that additional investment in our data center capacity server network infrastructure and office facility well scaling our headcount to support our growth including in our reality lab initiative will continue to drive expense growth in we expect capital expenditure to be in the range of billion and total expense to be in the range of billion in we also

bangladesh represented the top three source of growth in relative to the same period in of contentstrends in our monetization by facebook user geographywe calculate our revenue by user geography based on our estimate of the geography in which ad impression are delivered virtual and digital good are purchased or consumer hardware product are shipped we define arpu our total revenue in given geography during given quarter divided by the average of the number of maus in the geography at the beginning and end of the quarter while arpu includes all source of revenue the number of maus used in this calculation only includes user of facebook and messenger described in the definition of mau above while the share of revenue from user who are not also facebook or messenger maus ha grown over time we estimate that revenue from user who are facebook or messenger maus represents the substantial majority of our total revenue see average revenue per person arpp above for our estimate of trend in our monetization of our family product the geography of our user affect our revenue and financial result because we currently monetize user in different geography at different average rate our revenue and arpu in region such united state canada and europe are relatively higher primarily due to the size and maturity of those online and mobile advertising market for example arpu in in the united state canada region wa more than time higher than in the asia pacific region arpu arpu arpu arpu note non advertising revenue includes rl revenue generated from the delivery of consumer hardware product and foa other revenue which consists of net fee we receive from developer using our payment infrastructure and revenue from various other source of content our revenue by user geography in the chart above is geographically apportioned based on our estimation of the geographic location of our user when they perform revenue generating activity this allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated by geography disclosure in note revenue in our consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplemental data where revenue is geographically apportioned based on the address of our customer our annual worldwide arpu in which represents the sum of quarterly arpu during such period wa an increase of from for arpu increased by in rest of world in europe in the united state canada and in asia pacific compared with in addition user growth wa more rapid in geography with relatively lower arpu such asia pacific and rest of world we expect that user growth in the future will be primarily concentrated in those region where arpu is relatively lower such that worldwide arpu may continue to increase at slower rate relative to arpu in any geographic region or potentially decrease even if arpu increase in each geographic region of contentscritical accounting policy and estimatesour consolidated financial statement are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of these consolidated financial statement requires to make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset liability revenue cost and expense and related disclosure on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate and assumption based on historical experience and on various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance our actual result could differ from these estimate under different assumption or condition an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matter or the susceptibility of such matter to change and the impact of the estimate and assumption on our consolidated financial statement is material we believe that the assumption and estimate associated with gross net in revenue recognition valuation of equity investment income tax loss contingency and valuation of long lived asset including goodwill intangible asset and property and equipment and their associated estimated useful life when applicable have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statement therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting policy and estimate for further information on all of our significant accounting policy see note summary of significant accounting policy in the accompanying note to consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement and supplementary data of this annual report on form gross net in revenue recognitionfor revenue generated from arrangement that involve third party there is significant judgment in evaluating whether we are the principal and report revenue on gross basis or the agent and report revenue on net basis in this assessment we consider if we obtain control of the specified good or service before they are transferred to the customer well other indicator such the party primarily responsible for fulfillment inventory risk and discretion in establishing price the assessment of whether we are considered the principal or the agent in transaction could impact our revenue and cost of revenue recognized on the consolidated statement of income valuation of equity investmentsfor our equity security without readily determinable fair value accounted for using the measurement alternative determining whether an equity security issued by the same issuer is similar to the equity security we hold may require judgment in assessment of difference in right and obligation associated with the instrument such voting right distribution right and preference and conversion feature and adjustment to the observable price for difference such but not limited to right and obligation control premium liquidity or principal or most advantageous market in addition the identification of observable transaction will depend on the timely reporting of these transaction from our investee company which may occur in period subsequent to when the transaction take place therefore our fair value adjustment for these observable transaction may occur in period subsequent to when the transaction actually occurred for equity investment we perform qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering event for impairment the qualitative assessment considers factor such but not limited to the investee financial condition and business outlook industry and sector performance regulatory economic or technological environment operational and financing cash flow and other relevant event and factor affecting the investee when indicator of impairment exist we estimate the fair value of our equity investment using the market approach and or the income approach and recognize impairment loss in the consolidated statement of income if the estimated fair value is le than the carrying value estimating fair value requires judgment and use of estimate such discount rate forecast cash flow holding period and market data of comparable company among others income taxeswe are subject to income tax in the united state and numerous foreign jurisdiction significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income tax and income tax asset and liability including evaluating uncertainty in the application of accounting principle and complex tax law we recognize tax benefit from uncertain tax position only if we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authority based on the technical merit of the position these uncertain tax position include our estimate for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analysis of appropriate of contentsarms length price similarly our estimate related to uncertain tax position concerning research and development tax credit are based on an assessment of whether our available documentation corroborating the nature of our activity supporting the tax credit will be sufficient although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax position including net interest and penalty we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matter will not be materially different we make adjustment to these reserve in accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when fact and circumstance change such the closing of tax audit or the refinement of an estimate to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matter is different from the amount recorded such difference will affect the provision for income tax in the period in which such determination is made and could have material impact on our financial condition and operating result loss contingencieswe are involved in legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matter include speculative claim for substantial or indeterminate amount of damage additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligation around the world and we regularly become subject to new law and regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate the requirement for complying with these obligation may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authority and any failure to comply with such obligation could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matter asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated development on regular basis and accrue liability when we believe that it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is reasonable possibility that we may incur loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement to the extent material we review the development in our contingency that could affect the amount of the provision that have been previously recorded and the matter and related reasonably possible loss disclosed we make adjustment to our provision and change to our disclosure accordingly to reflect the merit of our defense and the impact of negotiation settlement regulatory proceeding ruling advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate ha changed for asserted and unasserted matter certain factor in particular have resulted in significant change to these estimate and judgment in prior quarter based on updated information available for example in certain jurisdiction where we operate fine and penalty may be the result of new law and preliminary interpretation regarding the basis of assessing damage which may make it difficult to estimate what such fine and penalty would amount to if successfully asserted against in addition certain government inquiry and investigation such matter before our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc are subject to review by other regulatory body before decision are finalized which can lead to significant change in the outcome of an inquiry result of these and other factor we reasonably expect that our estimate and judgment with respect to our contingency may continue to be revised in future quarter the ultimate outcome of these matter such whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matter were resolved against for amount in excess of management estimate of loss our result of operation and financial condition including in particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected see note commitment and contingency and note income tax of the accompanying note to our consolidated financial statement included in part ii item financial statement

asset and property and equipment and estimated useful life we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill to reporting unit based on the expected benefit from the business combination such valuation require management to make significant estimate and assumption especially with respect to intangible asset significant estimate in valuing

unpredictable and result actual result may differ from estimate allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable asset and liability affect our amortization expense acquired finite lived intangible asset are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we may record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value we have two reporting unit subject to goodwill impairment testing of december no impairment of goodwill ha been identified long lived asset including property and equipment and finite lived intangible asset are reviewed for possible impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable the evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability recoverability of these asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of property and equipment and intangible asset is not recoverable the carrying amount of such asset is reduced to fair value we have not recorded any material impairment charge during the year presented the useful life of our long lived asset including property and equipment and finite lived intangible asset are determined by management when those asset are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful life the current estimate of useful life represents our best estimate based on current fact and circumstance but may differ from the actual useful life due to change in future circumstance such change to our business operation change in the planned use of asset and technological advancement when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful life in connection with our periodic review of the estimated useful life of property and equipment we extended the estimated average useful life of our server and network asset category the effect of the change wa reduction in depreciation expense of

remaining restriction equity investment our equity investment are investment in equity security of privately held company without readily determinable fair value we elected to account for most of our equity investment using the measurement alternative which is cost le any impairment adjusted for change in fair value from observable transaction for identical or similar investment of the same issuer of the respective transaction date the change in carrying value if any is recognized in interest and other income net on our consolidated statement of income we periodically review our equity investment for impairment if of contentsindicators exist and the estimated fair value of an investment is below the carrying amount we will write the investment to fair value in addition we also held equity investment accounted for under the equity method which were immaterial of december and fair value measurementswe apply fair value accounting for all financial asset and liability and non financial asset and liability that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statement on recurring basis we define fair value the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer liability in an orderly transaction between market participant at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurement for asset and liability which are required to be recorded at fair value we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and the market based risk measurement or assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability such risk inherent in valuation technique transfer restriction and credit risk fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy which prioritizes the input used to measure fair value into three level and base the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level observable input other than quoted price in active market for identical asset and liability quoted price for identical or similar asset or liability in inactive market or other input that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability level input that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management estimate of assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability our cash equivalent and marketable security are classified within level or level of the fair value hierarchy because their fair value is derived from quoted market price or alternative pricing source and model utilizing observable market input our equity investment accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair value on non recurring basis when indicator of impairment exist or observable price change of qualified transaction occur the respective equity investment would be classified within level of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation method include combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable input including volatility right and obligation of the security we hold account receivable and allowancesaccounts receivable are recorded and carried at the original invoiced amount le an allowance for any potential uncollectible amount we make estimate of expected credit and collectibility trend for the allowance for credit loss and allowance for

charge is recognized we have not recorded any material impairment charge during the year presented the useful life of our property and equipment are determined by management when those asset are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful life our current estimate of useful life represents the best estimate of the useful life based on current fact and circumstance but may differ from the actual useful life due to change in future circumstance such change to our business operation change in the planned use of asset and technological advancement when we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining carrying amount of the asset is accounted for prospectively and depreciated or amortized over the revised estimated useful

mostly in our data center which is used to support production traffic land and asset held within construction in progress are not depreciated construction in progress is related to the construction or development of property and equipment that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use the cost of maintenance and repair is expensed incurred when asset are retired or otherwise

loss contingencieswe are involved in legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business certain of these matter include speculative claim for substantial or indeterminate amount of damage additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligation around the world and we regularly become subject to new law and regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate the requirement for complying with these obligation may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authority and any failure to comply with such obligation could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these matter asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated development on regular basis and accrue liability when we believe that it is both probable that loss ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated if we determine there is reasonable possibility that we may incur loss and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated we disclose the possible loss in the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement to the extent material we review the development in our contingency that could affect the amount of the provision that have been previously recorded and the matter and related reasonably possible loss disclosed we make adjustment to our provision and change to our disclosure accordingly to reflect the merit of our defense and the impact of negotiation settlement regulatory proceeding ruling advice of legal counsel and updated information significant judgment is required to determine the probability of loss and the estimated amount of loss including when and if the probability and estimate ha changed for asserted and unasserted matter certain factor in particular have resulted in significant change to these estimate and judgment in prior quarter based on updated information available for example in certain jurisdiction where we operate fine and penalty may be the result of new law and preliminary interpretation regarding the basis of assessing damage which may make it difficult to estimate what such fine and penalty would amount to if successfully asserted against in addition certain government inquiry and investigation such matter before our lead european union privacy regulator the idpc are subject to review by other regulatory body before decision can be finalized which can lead to significant change in the outcome of an inquiry result of these and other factor we reasonably expect that our estimate and judgment with respect to our contingency may continue to be revised in future quarter business combinationswe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible asset acquired liability assumed and intangible asset acquired based on their estimated fair value the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these identifiable asset and liability is recorded goodwill to reporting unit based on the expected benefit from the business combination allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable asset and liability affect the amortization expense acquired finite lived intangible asset are amortized over the useful life whereas any indefinite lived intangible asset including goodwill are not amortized during the measurement period which is not to exceed one year from the acquisition date we record adjustment to the asset acquired and liability assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill upon the conclusion of the measurement period any subsequent adjustment are recorded to earnings acquisition related expense are recognized separately from business combination and are expensed incurred goodwill and intangible assetswe allocate goodwill to reporting unit based on the expected benefit from business combination we evaluate our reporting unit annually well when change in our operating segment occur for change in reporting unit we reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level of contentsannually or more frequently if event or change in circumstance would more likely than not reduce the fair value of reporting unit below it carrying value we have two reporting unit subject to goodwill impairment testing of december no impairment of goodwill ha been identified we evaluate the recoverability of finite lived intangible asset for possible impairment whenever event or circumstance indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable the evaluation of these intangible asset are performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other asset and liability recoverability of these asset is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flow the asset are expected to generate from the use and eventual disposition if such review indicates that the carrying amount of finite lived intangible asset is not recoverable and the asset fair value is le than the carrying amount an impairment charge is recognized we have not recorded any material impairment charge during the year presented our finite lived intangible asset are amortized on straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset indefinite lived intangible asset are not amortized if an indefinite lived intangible asset is subsequently determined to have finite useful life the asset will be tested for impairment and accounted for finite lived intangible asset prospectively over it estimated remaining useful life we routinely review the remaining estimated useful life of finite lived intangible asset if we change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset the remaining unamortized balance is amortized over the revised estimated useful life foreign currencygenerally the functional currency of our

european regulator regarding various aspect of our regulatory compliance the gdpr is still relatively new law and draft decision in investigation by the idpc are subject to review by other european privacy regulator part of the gdpr consistency mechanism which may lead to significant change in the final outcome of such investigation result the interpretation and enforcement of the gdpr well the imposition and amount of penalty for non compliance are subject to significant uncertainty although we are vigorously defending our regulatory compliance we have accrued significant amount for loss contingency related to these inquiry and investigation in europe and we believe there is reasonable possibility that additional accrual for loss related to these matter could be material in the aggregate we are also subject to other government inquiry and investigation relating to our business activity and disclosure practice for example beginning in september we became subject to government investigation and request relating to former employee allegation and release of internal company document concerning among other thing our algorithm advertising and user metric and content enforcement practice well misinformation and other undesirable activity on our platform and user well being beginning on october multiple putative class action were filed in federal court in the united state against and certain of our director and officer alleging violation of security law in connection with the same matter we believe these lawsuit are without merit and we are vigorously defending them in

ascertain the precise scope of our legal obligation to comply with the request of those agency including our obligation to disclose user information in particular circumstance number of such instance have resulted in the assessment of fine and penalty against we believe we have multiple legal ground to satisfy these request or prevail against associated fine and penalty and we intend to vigorously defend such fine and penalty of contentswith respect to the case action and inquiry described above we evaluate the associated development on regular basis and accrue liability when we believe loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in addition we believe there is reasonable possibility that we may incur loss in some of these matter with respect to the matter described above that do not include an estimate of the amount of loss or range of possible loss such loss or range of possible loss either can not be estimated or are not individually material but we believe there is reasonable possibility that they may be material in the aggregate we are also party to various other legal proceeding claim and regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation that arise in the ordinary course of business for example we are subject to various litigation and government inquiry and investigation formal or informal by competition authority in the united state europe and other jurisdiction such investigation inquiry and lawsuit concern among other thing our business practice in the area of social networking or social medium service digital advertising and or mobile or online application well our acquisition for example in june we were informed by the ftc that it had opened an antitrust investigation of our company on december the ftc filed complaint against in the

brought on behalf of certain advertiser and user were consolidated in the district court for the northern district of california on january the court granted in part and denied in part our motion to dismiss the consolidated action we believe these lawsuit are without merit and we are vigorously defending them additionally we are required to comply with various legal and regulatory obligation around the world the requirement for complying with these obligation may be uncertain and subject to interpretation and enforcement by regulatory and other authority and any failure to comply with such obligation could eventually lead to asserted legal or regulatory action with respect to these other legal proceeding claim regulatory tax or government inquiry and investigation and other matter asserted and unasserted we evaluate the associated development on regular basis and accrue liability when we believe loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated in addition we believe there is reasonable possibility that we may incur loss in some of these other matter we believe that the amount of loss or any estimable range of possible loss with respect to these other matter will not either individually or in the aggregate have material adverse effect on our business and consolidated financial statement the ultimate outcome of the legal and related matter described in this section such whether the likelihood of loss is remote reasonably possible or probable or if and when the reasonably possible range of loss is estimable is inherently uncertain therefore if one or more of these matter were resolved against for amount in excess of management estimate of loss our result of operation and financial condition including in particular reporting period in which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable could be materially adversely affected for information regarding income tax contingency see note income tax of contentsindemnificationsin the normal course of business to facilitate transaction of service and product we have agreed to indemnify certain party with respect to certain matter we have agreed to hold certain party harmless against loss arising from breach of representation or covenant or out of intellectual property infringement or other claim made by third party these agreement may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim in addition we have entered into indemnification agreement with our officer director and certain employee and our certificate of incorporation and bylaw contain similar indemnification obligation it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreement due to the limited history of prior indemnification claim and the unique fact and circumstance involved in each particular agreement historically payment made by under these agreement have not had material impact on our consolidated financial statement in our

the irish tax authority for our through tax year our and subsequent tax year remain open to examination by the irs our and subsequent tax year remain open to examination in ireland in july we received statutory notice of deficiency notice from the irs related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary in conjunction with the examination of the tax year while the notice applies only to the tax year the irs stated that it will also apply it position for tax year subsequent to and ha done so in year covered by the second notice described below we do not agree with the position of the irs and have filed petition in the tax court challenging the notice on january the irs amendment to answer wa filed stating that it planned to assert at trial an adjustment that is higher than the adjustment stated in the notice the first session of the trial wa completed in march and second session commenced in october based on the information provided we believe that if the irs prevails in it updated position this could result in an additional federal tax liability of an estimated aggregate amount of up to approximately billion in excess of the amount in our originally filed return plus interest and any penalty asserted in march we received second notice from the irs in conjunction with the examination of our through tax year the irs applied it position from the tax year to each of these year and also proposed new adjustment related to other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary and certain tax credit that we claimed if the irs prevails in it position for these new adjustment this could result in an additional federal tax liability of up to approximately million in excess of the amount in our originally filed return plus interest and any penalty asserted we do not agree with the position of the irs in the second notice and have filed petition in the tax court challenging the second notice we have previously accrued an estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance in asc income tax asc that is lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the position taken by the irs in the two notice and it pretrial memorandum in addition if the irs prevails in it position related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiary the additional tax that we would owe would be partially offset by reduction in the tax that we owe under the mandatory transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings from the tax cut and job act of december we have not resolved these matter and proceeding continue in the tax court we believe that adequate amount have been reserved in accordance with asc for any adjustment to the provision for income tax or other tax item that may ultimately result from these examination the timing of the resolution settlement and closure of any audit is highly uncertain and it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit could significantly change in the next month given the number of year remaining that are subject to examination we are unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustment to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefit if the taxing authority prevail in the assessment of additional tax due the assessed tax interest and penalty if any could have material adverse impact on our financial position result of operation and cash flow note segment and
