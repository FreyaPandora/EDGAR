monitoring activity by certain governmental agency in combination with the use of artificial intelligence and new technology there ha been heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny around the world that could lead to further regulation and requirement and or future enforcement those development have also raised public attention on company data practice and have changed consumer and societal expectation for enhanced privacy and data protection any of these development could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition fraudulent activity and increasing cyberattacks have encouraged legislative and regulatory intervention and could damage our reputation and reduce the use and acceptance of our integrated product and service or increase our compliance cost criminal are using increasingly sophisticated method to capture consumer personal information to engage in illegal activity such counterfeiting or other fraud outsourcing and specialization become common in the payment industry there are more third party involved in processing transaction using our payment product while we are taking measure to make card and digital payment more secure increased fraud level involving our integrated product and service or misconduct or negligence by third party switching or otherwise servicing our integrated product and service could lead to legislative or regulatory intervention such enhanced security requirement and liability well damage to our reputation other regulation regulation that directly or indirectly apply to

directly overseen by the bank of england issuer and acquirer practice legislation and regulation certain regulation such in the eea may impact various aspect of our business for example strong authentication requirement could increase the number of transaction that consumer abandon if we are unable to secure frictionless authentication experience under the new standard an increase in the rate of abandoned transaction could adversely impact our volume or other operational metric increased regulatory focus on such in connection with the matter discussed above may result in costly compliance burden and or may otherwise increase our cost similarly increased regulatory focus on our customer may cause such customer to reduce the volume of transaction processed through our system or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of our product action by regulator could influence other organization around the world to enact or consider adopting similar measure mastercard form kpart

in response have adversely impacted our business result of operation and financial condition and may continue to do so depending on future development which are uncertain the global covid pandemic continues to have negative effect on the global economy the pandemic ha affected business activity adversely impacting consumer our customer supplier and business partner well our workforce variant of the virus have emerged resulting in resurgence of infection that have affected region at different time new variant may emerge with similar result the extent to which the resurgence and severity of infection ha affected and may in the future affect region is impacted by the ongoing global administration of vaccine and the availability of therapeutic treatment in those location government business and consumer continue to react to the changing condition tightening or loosening safety measure or voluntarily making personal safety decision applicable based on the current environment of their location the pandemic ha caused to modify our business practice including employee travel employee work location and working in remote or hybrid environment we continue to monitor the effect of the pandemic and may take further action required that are in the best interest of our employee customer and business partner and which otherwise meet the response by mastercard form iitem risk factorsgovernments business and consumer there is no certainty that such measure will be sufficient to mitigate the risk posed by the virus or otherwise be satisfactory to government authority or voluntary action taken by the public the covid pandemic ha adversely impacted our business result of operation and financial condition there are no comparable recent event which may provide guidance to the effect of global pandemic such covid and result the ultimate impact of this pandemic or similar health epidemic in the future is highly uncertain and subject to change the full extent to which the covid pandemic and measure taken in response further impact our business result of operation and financial condition will depend on future development which are uncertain including but not limited to the duration of the pandemic and it impact on the global economy including how quickly and to what extent we can continue to progress toward more consistent economic and operating condition even after the covid pandemic ha subsided we may continue to experience materially adverse impact to our business and our result of operation result of it global economic impact including any recession that ha occurred or may occur in the future competition and technologysubstantial and intense competition worldwide in the global payment industry may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation the global payment industry is highly competitive our payment program compete against competitor both within and outside of the global payment industry and compete in all category of payment including paper based payment and all form of electronic payment we compete against general purpose payment network debit and local network ach and real time account based payment system alternative payment system and new entrant focused on online activity across various channel and processing payment using in house capability national network and digital currency we also face competition from company that provide alternative to our value added service and adjacent network capability including open banking and digital identity our traditional competitor may have substantially greater financial and other resource than we have may offer wider range of program service and payment capability than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategy to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have they may also introduce their own innovative program value added service and capability that adversely impact our growth certain of our competitor to our core network operate three party payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and these competitor may derive competitive advantage from their business model if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitor because we operate four party system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in way in which our competitor are not we could lose business to these competitor see business competition in part item new entrant against whom we compete have developed alternative payment system commerce payment system and payment system for mobile device well physical store location number of these new entrant rely principally on technology to support their service that provides cost advantage and result may enjoy lower cost than we do which could put at competitive disadvantage our ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiative well the outcome of litigation competition related regulatory proceeding and central bank activity and legislative activity if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor drive value for our customer and or effectively align our resource with our goal and objective we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation disintermediation from stakeholder both within and outside of the payment value chain could harm our business the payment industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risk including party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position an intermediary in the payment process for example merchant could switch and in some case are switching transaction directly with issuer additionally processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer large scale consolidation within processor could result in these processor developing bilateral agreement or in some case switching the entire transaction on their own network thereby disintermediating industry participant continue to invest in and develop alternative capability such account to account payment which could facilitate transaction that compete with our core payment network mastercard form kpart iitem risk factor regulation such in the eea may disintermediate issuer by enabling third party provider opportunity to route payment transaction away from our network and product and towards other form of payment by offering account information or payment initiation service directly to those who currently use our product such regulation may also provide these processor with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transaction they are servicing if our customer are disintermediated in their business we could face diminished demand for our integrated product and service although we partner with fintechs and technology company such digital player and mobile provider that leverage our technology platform and network to deliver their product they could develop platform or network that disintermediate from digital payment and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy when we do partner with fintechs and technology company we face heightened risk when those relationship involve sharing mastercard data while we share this data in controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standard without proper oversight we could give the partner competitive advantage competitor customer fintechs technology company government and other industry participant may develop product that compete with or replace value added product and service we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offering these product could replace our own switching and payment offering or could force to change our pricing or practice for these offering in addition government that develop or encourage the creation of national payment platform may promote their platform in such way that could put at competitive disadvantage in those market or require to compete differently participant in the payment industry may merge create joint venture or form other business combination that may strengthen their existing business service or create new payment product and service that compete with our product and service our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation continued intense pricing pressure may materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in order to increase transaction volume enter new market and expand our mastercard branded card and enabled product and service we seek to enter into business agreement with customer through which we offer incentive pricing discount and other support that promote our product in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentive and pricing discount we continue to experience pricing pressure the demand from our customer for better pricing arrangement and greater rebate and incentive moderate our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to switch additional transaction volume or to provide additional service to our customer at level sufficient to compensate for such lower fee or increased cost in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition increased pressure on price increase the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those relating to customer incentive in the future we may not be able to enter into agreement with our customer if they require term that we are unable or unwilling to offer and we may be required to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitor are larger and have greater financial resource than we do and accordingly may be able to charge lower price to our customer in addition to the extent that we offer discount or incentive under such agreement we will need to further increase transaction volume or the amount of service provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreement and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customer also may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase request for greater incentive or greater cost stability these factor could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation rapid and significant technological development and change could negatively impact our overall business and result of operation or limit our future growth the payment industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change which can impact our business in several way technological change including continuing development of technology in the area of smart card and device contactless and mobile payment commerce cryptocurrency and block chain technology machine learning and ai could result in new technology that may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our program and service moreover these change could result in new and innovative payment method and product that could place at competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our product we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology the inability of these company to keep pace with technological development or the acquisition of these company by competitor could negatively impact our offering mastercard form iitem risk factor our ability to develop and adopt new service and technology may be inhibited by industry wide solution and standard such those related to emv tokenization or other safety and security technology and by resistance from customer or merchant to such change our ability to develop evolving system and product may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining technology expert our ability to adopt these technology can also be inhibited by intellectual property right of third party we have received and we may in the future receive notice or inquiry from patent holder for example other operating company or non practicing entity suggesting that we may be infringing certain patent or that we need to license the use of their patent to avoid infringement such notice may among other thing threaten litigation against or our customer or demand significant license fee our ability to develop new technology and reflect technological change in our payment offering will require resource which may result in additional expense we work with fintechs technology company such digital player and mobile provider and traditional customer that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment related product and service quickly and efficiently to consumer our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customer to work with and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against regulatory or government requirement could require to host and deliver certain product and service on soil in certain market which would require to alter our technology and delivery model potentially resulting in additional expense various central bank are experimenting with digital currency called central bank digital currency cbdc cbdcs may be launched with their own network to transfer money between participant policy and design consideration that government adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating cbdc based payment transaction potentially impacting the transaction that we may process over our network we can not predict the effect of technological change on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard failure to keep pace with these technological development or otherwise bring to market product that reflect these technology could lead to decline in the use of our product which could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation operating real time account based payment network present risk that could materially affect our business regulator have designated vocalink our real time account based payment network platform to be specified service provider and regulator in other country may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real time account based payment system in similar way in addition any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impact including potential intervention by the bank of england and significant reputational risk to vocalink and for discussion of the regulatory risk related to our real time account based payment platform see our risk factor in risk factor payment industry regulation in this part item furthermore the complexity of this payment technology requires careful management to address security vulnerability that are different from those faced on our core network operational difficulty such the temporary unavailability of our service or product or security breach on our real time account based payment network could cause loss of business for these product and service result in potential liability for and adversely affect our reputation working with new customer and end user we expand our multi rail solution and integrated product and service can present operational and onboarding challenge be costly and result in reputational damage if the new product or service do not perform intended the payment market in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change new product introduction evolving industry standard and changing customer and consumer need in order to remain competitive and meet the need of the payment market we are continually involved in developing complex multi rail solution and diversifying our integrated product and service these effort carry the risk associated with any diversification initiative including cost overrun delay in delivery and performance problem these project also carry risk associated with working with different type of customer for example organization such corporation that are not financial institution and non governmental organization ngo and end user other than those we have traditionally worked with these difference may present new operational challenge in the development and implementation of our new product or service these new customer are typically le regulated and result enhanced infrastructure and monitoring is required our failure to effectively design and deliver these multi rail solution and integrated product and service could make our other offering le desirable to customer or put at competitive disadvantage in addition if there is delay in the implementation of our product or service or if our product or service do not perform anticipated or we are unable to adequately anticipate mastercard form kpart iitem risk factorsrisks related to new type of customer we could face additional regulatory scrutiny fine sanction or other penalty which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation well negatively impact our brand and reputation information security and service disruptionsinformation security incident or account data compromise event could disrupt our business damage our reputation increase our cost and cause loss information security risk for payment and technology company such ours have significantly increased in recent year in part because of the proliferation of new technology the use of the internet and telecommunication technology to conduct financial transaction and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime hacker terrorist and other external party these threat may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employee or third party or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threat include cyber attack such computer virus malicious code including ransomware phishing attack or information security breach and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft the advent of the global covid pandemic ha resulted in significant rise in these type of threat due to significant portion of our workforce working from home in mostly remote environment our operation rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information and technology in our computer system and network well the system of our third party provider our customer and other party in the payment value chain well account holder rely on our digital technology computer system software and network to conduct their operation in addition to access our integrated product and service our customer and account holder increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pc and other mobile device that may be beyond our control we like other financial technology organization routinely are subject to cyber threat and our technology system and network well the system of our third party provider have been subject to attempted cyber attack because of our position in the payment value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be target of such threat and attack additionally geopolitical event and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threat and attack by affected jurisdiction and their sympathizer to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber attack or other information security breach however future attack or breach could lead to security breach of the network system including third party provider system or device that our customer use to access our integrated product and service which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromise such attack or breach could also cause service interruption malfunction or other failure in the physical infrastructure or operation system that support our business and customer such the lack of availability of our value added service well the operation of our customer or other third party in addition they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customer and other party and the market additional cost to such repairing system adding new personnel or protection technology or compliance cost regulatory penalty financial loss to both and our customer and partner and the loss of customer and business opportunity if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded despite various mitigation effort that we undertake there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risk and not suffer material breach and resulting loss in the future or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all loss our risk and exposure to these matter remain heightened because of among other thing the evolving nature of these threat our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payment and technology industry our plan to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategy and develop additional remote connectivity solution to serve our customer and account holder when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third party vendor and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunity result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our control process and practice designed to protect our system computer software data and network from attack damage or unauthorized access remain priority for cyber threat continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resource to continue to modify or enhance our protective measure or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerability any of the risk described above could materially adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition to information security risk for our system we also routinely encounter account data compromise event involving merchant and third party payment processor that process store or transmit payment transaction data which affect million of mastercard visa discover american express and other type of account holder further event of this type may subject to reputational damage and or lawsuit involving payment product carrying our brand damage to our reputation or that of our brand resulting from an account data breach of either our system or the system of our customer merchant and other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated product and service such event could also slow or reverse the mastercard form iitem risk factorstrend toward electronic payment in addition to reputational concern the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise event could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such event by among other thing making it more difficult to identify consumer moreover while most of the lawsuit resulting from account data breach do not involve direct claim against and while we have release from many issuer and acquirer we could still face damage claim which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our result of operation such event could have material adverse impact on our transaction volume result of operation and prospect for future growth or increase our cost by leading to additional regulatory burden being imposed on service disruption that cause to be unable to process transaction or service our customer could materially affect our overall business and result of operation our transaction switching system and other offering have experienced in limited instance and may continue to experience interruption result of technology malfunction fire weather event power outage telecommunication disruption terrorism workplace violence accident or other catastrophic event including those related to climate change our visibility in the global payment industry may also put at greater risk of attack by terrorist activist or hacker who intend to disrupt our facility and or system additionally we rely on third party service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed market could also result in service disruption which could impact our ability to do business in those market if one of our service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service although we maintain enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk ass potential impact and develop effective response strategy we can not ensure that our business would be immune to these risk because of the intrinsic importance of our switching system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of product carrying our brand and materially adversely affect our overall business and our result of operation stakeholder relationshipslosing significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customer could lead to significant revenue decrease in the longer term which could have material adverse impact on our business and our result of operation many of our customer relationship are not exclusive our customer can reassess their future commitment to subject to the term of our contract and they separately may develop their own service that compete with ours our business agreement with these customer may not ultimately reduce the risk inherent in our business that customer may terminate their relationship with in favor of relationship with our competitor or for other reason or might not meet their contractual obligation to in addition significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customer loss of business from any of our large customer could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation exclusive near exclusive relationship certain customer have with our competitor may have material adverse impact on our business while we have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with certain of our customer to issue payment product other customer have similar exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to do significant amount of business with these customer to increase our revenue in addition these customer may be more successful and may grow faster than the customer that primarily issue our payment product which could put at competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customer with nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor such relationship could provide advantage to the customer to shift business from to the competitor with which they are principally aligned significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volume from these customer could have material adverse impact on our business consolidation amongst our customer could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation our customer industry have undergone substantial accelerated consolidation in the past these consolidation have included customer with substantial mastercard portfolio being acquired by institution with strong relationship with competitor if significant consolidation among customer were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for which could have material adverse impact on our business and prospect in addition one or more of our customer could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitor and any such transaction could also have material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce smaller number of large customer which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower price and or more favorable term for our customer these development could materially and adversely affect our result of operation mastercard form kpart iitem risk factorsour business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and in many jurisdiction their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brand while we work directly with many stakeholder in the payment system including merchant government fintechs and large digital company and other technology company we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationship with our issuer and acquirer and their respective relationship with account holder and merchant to support our program and service furthermore we depend on our issuing partner and acquirer to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market we do not issue card or other payment device extend credit to account holder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to account holder each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program feature in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchant are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customer result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and the strength of our relationship with them in turn our customer success depends on variety of factor over which we have little or no influence including economic condition in global financial market or their disintermediation by competitor or emerging technology well regulation if our customer become financially unstable we may lose revenue or we may be exposed to settlement risk see our risk factor in risk factor settlement and third party obligation in this part item with respect to how we guarantee certain third party obligation for further discussion with the exception of the united state and select number of other jurisdiction most in country opposed to cross border transaction conducted using mastercard maestro and cirrus card are authorized cleared and settled by our customer or other processor because we do not provide domestic switching service in these country and do not described above have direct relationship with account holder we depend on our close working relationship with our customer to effectively manage our brand and the perception of our payment system among consumer in these country we also rely on these customer to help manage our brand and perception among regulator and merchant in these country alongside our own relationship with them from time to time our customer may take action that we do not believe to be in the best interest of our payment system overall which may materially and adversely impact our business merchant continued focus on acceptance cost may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding and increase our incentive program cost which could materially and adversely affect our profitability merchant are important constituent in our payment system we rely on both our relationship with them well their relationship with our issuer and acquirer customer to continue to expand the acceptance of our integrated product and service we also work with merchant to help them enable new sale channel create better purchase experience improve efficiency increase revenue and fight fraud in the retail industry there is set of larger merchant with increasingly global scope and influence we believe that these merchant are having significant impact on all participant in the global payment industry including mastercard some large merchant have supported the legal regulatory and legislative challenge to interchange fee that mastercard ha been defending including the merchant litigation some merchant are increasingly asking regulator to review and potentially regulate our own network fee in addition to interchange see our risk factor in risk factor other regulation in this part item with respect to payment industry regulation including interchange fee the continued focus of merchant on the cost of accepting various form of payment including in connection with the growth of digital payment may lead to additional litigation and regulatory proceeding certain larger merchant are also able to negotiate incentive from and pricing concession from our issuer and acquirer customer condition to accepting our product we also make payment to certain merchant to incentivize them to create co branded payment program with merchant consolidate and become even larger we may have to increase the amount of incentive that we provide to certain merchant which could materially and adversely affect our result of operation competitive and regulatory pressure on pricing could make it difficult to offset the cost of these incentive additionally if the rate of merchant acceptance growth slows our business could suffer our work with government expose to unique risk that could have material impact on our business and result of operation we increase our work with national state and local government both indirectly through financial institution and with them directly our customer we may face various risk inherent in associating or contracting directly with government these risk include but are not limited to the following governmental entity typically fund project through appropriated monies change in governmental priority or other political development including disruption in governmental

customer fails to fund it daily settlement obligation due to technical problem liquidity shortfall insolvency or other reason concurrent settlement failure of more than one of our larger customer or of several of our smaller customer either on given day or over condensed period of time may exceed our available resource and could materially and adversely affect our result of operation we have significant contractual indemnification obligation with certain customer an event occur that trigger these obligation such an event could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation global economic and political environmentglobal economic political financial and societal event or condition could result in material and adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation adverse economic trend in key country in which we operate may adversely affect our financial performance such impact may include but is not limited to the following customer mitigating their economic exposure by limiting the issuance of new mastercard product and requesting greater incentive or greater cost stability from consumer and business lowering spending which could impact domestic and cross border spend government intervention including the effect of law regulation and or government investment on or in our financial institution customer well uncertainty due to changing political regime in executive legislative and or judicial branch of government that may have potential negative effect on our business and our relationship with customer or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our product tightening of credit availability that could impact the ability of participating financial institution to lend to under the term of our credit facilityadditionally we switch substantially all cross border transaction using mastercard maestro and cirrus branded card and generate significant amount of revenue from cross border volume fee and fee related to switched transaction revenue from switching cross border and currency conversion transaction for our customer fluctuates with the level and destination of cross border travel and our customer need for transaction to be converted into their base currency cross border activity ha and may continue to be adversely affected by world geopolitical economic health weather and other

extreme weather event including those related to climate change government investor and other stakeholder face pressure to address climate change and other sustainability matter these stakeholder may express new expectation focus investment and require additional disclosure in way that cause significant shift in commerce and consumption behavior the impact of and uncertainty that could result from any of these event or factor could ultimately decrease cross border activity additionally any regulation of interregional interchange fee could also negatively impact our cross border activity in each case decreased cross border activity could decrease the revenue we receive our operation global payment network rely in part on global interoperable standard to help facilitate safe and simple payment to the extent geopolitical event result in jurisdiction no longer participating in the creation or adoption of these standard or the creation of competing standard the product and service we offer could be negatively impacted any of these development could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation mastercard form kpart iitem risk factorsadverse currency

included in our net income our risk management activity provide protection with respect to adverse change in the value of only limited number of currency and are based on estimate of exposure to these currency in addition some of the revenue we generate outside the united state is subject to unpredictable currency fluctuation including devaluation of currency where the value of other currency change relative to the dollar if the dollar strengthens compared to currency in which we generate revenue this revenue may be translated at materially lower amount than expected furthermore we may become subject to exchange control regulation that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currency into dollar such what we have experienced in venezuela the occurrence of

make strategic decision we believe that the key metric presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide meaningful comparison of our result between period gross dollar volume gdv measure dollar volume of activity on card carrying our brand during the period on local currency basis and dollar converted basis gdv represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance transfer and convenience check purchase volume mean the aggregate dollar amount of purchase made with mastercard branded card for the relevant period and cash volume mean the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursement and includes the impact of balance transfer and convenience check obtained with mastercard branded card for the relevant period information denominated in dollar relating to gdv is calculated by applying an established dollar local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volume are reported these exchange rate are calculated on quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter we report period over period rate of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information in order to eliminate the impact of change in the value of currency against the dollar in calculating such rate of change cross border measure cross border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period on local currency basis and dollar converted basis for all mastercard branded program switched measure the number of transaction switched by mastercard which is defined the number of transaction initiated and switched through our network during the period mastercard form iiitem management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationsoperating margin measure how much profit we make on each dollar of sale after our operating cost but other income expense and income tax expense operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue data used in the calculation of gdv is provided by mastercard customer and is subject to verification by mastercard and partial cross checking against information provided by mastercard transaction switching system all data is subject to revision and amendment by mastercard or mastercard customer growth rate are normalized to eliminate the effect of differing switching and carryover day between period carryover day are those where transaction and volume from day where the company not clear and settle are processed in the fourth quarter of we began clearing and settling transaction and volume on daily basis foreign currencycurrency impactour primary revenue functional currency are the dollar euro brazilian real and the british pound our overall operating result are impacted by currency translation which represents the effect of translating operating result where the functional currency is different than our dollar reporting currency our operating result are also impacted by transactional currency the impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transaction occurring in currency other than the functional currency change in currency exchange rate directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume gdv and gross euro volume gev which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessment cross border volume fee and certain volume related rebate and incentive in most non european region gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to dollar using average exchange rate for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euro using average exchange rate for the period result certain of our domestic assessment cross border volume fee and volume related rebate and incentive are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the dollar versus non european local currency and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currency for example our billing in australia is in the dollar however consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar the currency transactional impact of converting australian dollar to our dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the dollar is evident when gdv growth on dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on local currency basis in gdv on dollar converted basis increased while gdv on local currency basis increased versus in gdv on dollar converted basis decreased while gdv on local currency basis increased versus further the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue other revenue and operating expense when the local currency of these item is different than the functional currency of the entity through december our approach to managing transactional currency exposure consisted of hedging portion of anticipated revenue impacted by transactional currency by entering into foreign exchange derivative contract and recording the related change in fair value in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operation during the first quarter of we started to formally designate certain newly executed foreign exchange derivative contract which meet the established accounting criterion cash flow hedge gain and loss resulting from change in fair value of these designated contract are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and subsequently recognized in the respective component of net revenue when the underlying forecasted transaction impact earnings foreign exchange activitywe incur foreign currency gain and loss from remeasuring monetary asset and liability including settlement asset and obligation that are denominated in currency other than the functional currency of the entity to manage this foreign exchange risk we may enter into foreign exchange derivative contract to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure of portion of our nonfunctional monetary asset and liability the gain or loss resulting from change in fair value of these contract are intended to reduce the potential effect of the underlying hedged exposure and are recorded net within general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operation the impact of this foreign exchange activity including the related hedging activity ha not been eliminated in our currency neutral result our foreign exchange risk management activity are discussed further in note derivative and hedging instrument to the consolidated financial statement included in part ii item risk of currency devaluationwe are exposed to currency devaluation in certain country in addition we are subject to exchange control regulation that restrict the conversion of financial asset into dollar while these revenue and asset are not material to on consolidated basis we can be
