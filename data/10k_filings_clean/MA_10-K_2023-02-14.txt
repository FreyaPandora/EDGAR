could adversely impact our volume or other operational metric increased regulatory focus on ha resulted and may continue to result in significant compliance and governance burden or otherwise increase our cost similarly increased regulatory focus on our customer may cause such customer to reduce the volume of transaction processed through our system or may otherwise impact the competitiveness of

with new economic sanction and related law with respect to particular jurisdiction or customer could result in loss of business which could be significant moreover while our risk based compliance program obligates issuer and acquirer to comply with their local sanction program among other obligation the failure of those issuer and acquirer to identify potential non compliance issue either

compete against general purpose payment network debit and local network ach and real time account based payment system alternative payment system and new entrant focused on online activity across various channel and processing payment using in house capability government backed network and digital currency we also face competition from company that provide alternative to our value added service and new adjacent network capability including open banking and digital identity our traditional competitor may have substantially greater financial and other resource than we have may offer wider range of program service and payment capability than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketing strategy to achieve broader brand recognition and merchant acceptance than we have they may also introduce their own innovative program value added service and capability that adversely impact our growth certain of our competitor to our core payment network operate three party payment system with direct connection to both merchant and consumer and these competitor may derive competitive advantage from their business model if we continue to attract more regulatory scrutiny than these competitor because we operate four party system or we are regulated because of the system we operate in way in which our competitor are not we could lose business to these competitor see business competition in part item new entrant against whom we compete have developed alternative payment system commerce payment system and payment system for mobile device well physical store location number of these new entrant rely principally on technology to support their service that provides cost advantage and result may enjoy lower cost than we do which could put at competitive disadvantage our ability to compete may also be affected by regulatory and legislative initiative well the outcome of litigation competition related regulatory proceeding and central bank activity and legislative activity moreover the suspension of our business operation in russia may provide the opportunity for competitor to grow their business and increase their market share and relative competitive position in other jurisdiction if we are not able to differentiate from our competitor drive value for our customer and or effectively align our resource with our goal and objective we may not be able to compete effectively against these threat our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation disintermediation from stakeholder both within and outside of the payment value chain could harm our business the payment industry continues to develop and change we face disintermediation and related risk including party that process our transaction in certain country may try to eliminate our position an intermediary in the payment process for example merchant could switch and in some case are switching transaction directly with issuer additionally processor could process transaction directly between issuer and acquirer large scale consolidation within processor could result in these processor developing bilateral agreement or in some case switching the entire transaction on their own network thereby disintermediating industry participant continue to invest in and develop alternative capability such account to account payment which could facilitate transaction that compete with both our core payment network and our additional payment capability regulation such in the eea may disintermediate issuer by enabling third party provider opportunity to route payment transaction away from our network and product and towards other form of payment by offering account information or payment initiation service directly to those who currently use our product such regulation may also provide these processor with the opportunity to commoditize the data that are included in the transaction they are servicing if our customer are disintermediated in their business we could face diminished demand for our integrated product and service although we partner with fintechs and technology company such digital player and mobile provider that leverage our technology platform and network to deliver their product they could develop platform or network that disintermediate from digital payment and impact our ability to compete in the digital economy these company may also develop product or mastercard form kpart iitem risk factorsservices that compete with our customer within the payment ecosystem and result could diminish demand for our product and service when we do partner with fintechs and technology company we face heightened risk when we share data part of those relationship while we share this data in controlled manner subject to applicable anonymization and privacy and data standard sharing this data without proper oversight could provide partner with competitive advantage competitor customer fintechs technology company government and other industry participant may develop product that compete with or replace value added product and service we currently provide to support our switched transaction and payment offering these product could either replace or force to change our pricing or practice for these offering in addition government that develop or encourage the creation of national or international payment platform may promote their platform in such way that could put at competitive disadvantage in those market or require to compete differently participant in the payment industry may merge create joint venture or form other business combination that may strengthen their existing business service or create new payment product and service that compete with our product and service our failure to compete effectively against any of the foregoing competitive threat could materially and adversely

volume enter new market and expand our product and service we seek to enter into business agreement with customer through which we offer incentive pricing discount and other support that promote our product in order to stay competitive we may have to increase the amount of these incentive and pricing discount we continue to experience pricing pressure the demand from our customer for better pricing arrangement and greater rebate and incentive moderate our growth we may not be able to continue our expansion strategy to switch additional transaction volume or to provide additional service to our customer at level sufficient to compensate for such lower fee or increased cost in the future which could materially and adversely affect our overall business and result of operation in addition increased pressure on price increase the importance of cost containment and productivity initiative in area other than those relating to customer incentive in the future we may not be able to enter into agreement with our customer if they require term that we are unable or unwilling to offer and we may be required to modify existing agreement in order to maintain relationship and to compete with others in the industry some of our competitor are larger with greater financial resource and accordingly may be able to charge lower price to our customer in addition to the extent that we offer discount or incentive under such agreement we will need to further increase transaction volume or the amount of service provided thereunder in order to benefit incrementally from such agreement and to increase revenue and profit and we may not be successful in doing so particularly in the current regulatory environment our customer also may implement cost reduction initiative that reduce or eliminate payment product marketing or increase request for greater incentive or greater cost stability these factor could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation additionally we face pricing pressure related to real time account based payment scheme and cross border payment these pressure include the increased use of domestic real time account based payment scheme offering increasingly lower or subsidized pricing for transaction well continued downward pressure on pricing for cross border payment resulting from competition from real time account based payment scheme and from initiative to lower the cost of cross border payment to end user such the roadmap for enhancing cross border payment these factor could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation rapid and significant technological development and change could negatively impact our overall business and result of operation or limit our future growth the payment industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change which can impact our business in several way technological change including continuing development of technology in the area of smart card and device contactless and mobile payment commerce cryptocurrency and blockchain technology machine learning and ai could result in new technology that may be superior to or render obsolete the technology we currently use in our program and service moreover these change could result in new and innovative payment method and product that could place at competitive disadvantage and that could reduce the use of our product we rely in part on third party including some of our competitor and potential competitor for the development of and access to new technology the inability of these company to keep pace with technological development or the acquisition of these company by competitor could negatively impact our offering mastercard form iitem risk factor our ability to develop and adopt new service and technology may be inhibited by industry wide solution and standard such those related to emv tokenization or other safety and security technology and by resistance from customer or merchant to such change our ability to develop evolving system and product may be inhibited by any difficulty we may experience in attracting and retaining employee with technology expertise our ability to adopt these technology can also be inhibited by intellectual property right of third party we have received and we may in the future receive notice or inquiry from patent holder for example other operating company or non practicing entity suggesting that we may be infringing certain patent or that we need to license the use of their patent to avoid infringement such notice may among other thing threaten litigation against or our customer or demand significant license fee our ability to develop new technology and reflect technological change in our payment offering requires resource which ha resulted in and may further result in additional expense we work with fintechs technology company such digital player and mobile provider and traditional customer that use our technology to enhance payment safety and security and to deliver their payment related product and service quickly and efficiently to consumer our inability to keep pace technologically could negatively impact the willingness of these customer to work with and could encourage them to use their own technology and compete against regulatory or government requirement have and could continue to require to host and deliver certain product and service on soil in certain market requiring to alter our technology and delivery model potentially resulting in additional expense various central bank are experimenting with digital currency called central bank digital currency cbdcs cbdcs may be launched with their own network to transfer money between participant policy and design consideration that government adopt could impact the extent of our role in facilitating cbdc based payment transaction potentially impacting the transaction that we may process over our network we can not predict the effect of future technological change on our business and our future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate develop or adapt to technological change and evolving industry standard failure to keep pace with these technological development or otherwise bring to market product that reflect these technology could lead to decline in the use of our product which could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation operating real time account based payment network present risk that could materially affect our business regulator have designated vocalink our real time account based payment network platform to be specified service provider and regulator in other country may in the future expand their regulatory oversight of real time account based payment system in similar way in addition any prolonged service outage on this network could result in quickly escalating impact including potential intervention by the bank of

need of the payment market we are continually involved in developing complex multi rail solution and diversifying our integrated product and service these effort carry the risk associated with any diversification initiative including cost overrun delay in delivery and performance problem these project also carry risk associated with working with different type of customer for example organization such corporation that are not financial institution and non governmental organization ngo and end user other than those we have traditionally worked with these difference may present new

negatively impact our brand and reputation information security and operational resilienceinformation security incident or account data compromise event could disrupt our business damage our

new technology the use of the internet and telecommunication technology to conduct financial transaction and the increased sophistication and activity of organized crime hacker terrorist and other external party these threat may derive from fraud or malice on the part of our employee or third party or may result from human error or accidental technological failure these threat include cyber attack such computer virus malicious code including ransomware phishing attack or information security breach and could lead to the misappropriation of consumer account and other information and identity theft these type of threat have risen significantly due to significant portion of our workforce working in remote or hybrid environment our operation rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential proprietary and other information and technology in our computer system and network well the system of our third party provider our customer and other party in the payment value chain well account holder rely on our digital technology computer system software and network to conduct their operation in addition to access our integrated product and service our customer and account holder increasingly use personal smartphones tablet pc and other mobile device that may be beyond our control we like other financial technology organization routinely are subject to cyber threat and our technology system and network well the system of our third party provider have been subject to attempted cyber attack because of our position in the payment value chain we believe that we are likely to continue to be target of such threat and attack in response to and european sanction against russia earlier this year we saw increased information security threat from state sponsored actor other geopolitical event and resulting government activity could also lead to information security threat and attack by affected or sympathizing jurisdiction or other actor which could put our information and asset at risk well result in network disruption to date we have not experienced any material impact relating to cyber attack or other information security breach however future attack or breach could lead to security breach of the network system including third party provider system or device that our customer use to access our integrated product and service which in turn could result in the unauthorized disclosure release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information including account data information or data security compromise such attack or breach could also cause service interruption malfunction or other failure in the physical infrastructure or operation system that support our business and customer such the lack of availability of our value added service well the operation of our customer or other third party in addition they could lead to damage to our reputation with our customer other stakeholder and the broader payment ecosystem additional cost to such repairing system adding new personnel or protection technology or compliance cost regulatory penalty financial loss to both and our customer and partner and the loss of customer and business opportunity these consequence could be further pronounced in jurisdiction in which we are deemed critical national infrastructure if such attack are not detected immediately their effect could be compounded despite various mitigation effort that we undertake there can be no assurance that we will be immune to these risk and not suffer material breach and resulting loss in the future or that our insurance coverage would be sufficient to cover all loss our risk and exposure to these matter remain heightened because of among other thing the evolving nature of these threat our prominent size and scale and our role in the global payment and technology industry our plan to continue to implement our digital and mobile channel strategy and develop additional remote connectivity solution to serve our customer and account holder when and how they want to be served our global presence our extensive use of third party vendor and future joint venture and merger and acquisition opportunity result information security and the continued development and enhancement of our control process and practice designed to protect our

breach of either our system or the system of our customer merchant and other third party could decrease the use and acceptance of our integrated product and service such event could also slow or reverse the trend toward electronic payment in addition to reputational concern the cumulative impact of multiple account data compromise event could increase the impact of the fraud resulting from such event by among other thing making it more difficult to identify consumer moreover while most of the lawsuit resulting from account data breach do not involve direct claim against and while we have release from many issuer and acquirer we could still face damage claim which if upheld could materially and adversely affect our result of operation such event could have material adverse impact on our transaction volume result of operation and prospect for future growth or increase our cost by leading to additional regulatory burden being imposed on service disruption that cause to be unable to process transaction or service our customer could reduce our operational resilience and materially affect our overall business and result of operation our transaction switching system and other

workplace violence accident or other catastrophic event including those related to climate change our visibility in the global payment industry may also put at greater risk of attack by terrorist activist or hacker who intend to disrupt our facility and or system additionally we rely on third party service provider for the timely transmission of information across our global data network inadequate infrastructure in lesser developed market could also result in service disruption which could impact our ability to do business in those market if one of our service provider fails to provide the communication capacity or service we require result of natural disaster operational disruption terrorism hacking or any other reason the failure could interrupt our service although we maintain an enterprise resiliency program to analyze risk ass potential impact and develop effective response strategy we can not ensure that our business would be immune to these risk because of the intrinsic importance of our switching system to our business any interruption or degradation could adversely affect the perception of the reliability of product carrying our brand and materially adversely affect our overall business and our result of operation stakeholder relationshipslosing significant portion of business from one or more of our largest customer could lead to significant

their future commitment to subject to the term of our contract and they separately may develop their own service that compete with ours our business agreement with these customer may not ultimately reduce the risk inherent in our business that customer may terminate their relationship with in favor of relationship with our competitor or for other reason or might not meet their contractual obligation to in addition significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customer loss of business from any of our large customer could have material adverse impact on our overall business and result of operation exclusive near exclusive relationship certain customer have with our competitor may have material adverse impact on our business while we have exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with certain of our customer to issue payment product other customer have similar exclusive or nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor these relationship may make it difficult or cost prohibitive for to do significant amount of business with these customer to increase our revenue in addition these customer may be more successful and may grow faster than the customer that primarily issue our payment product which could put at competitive disadvantage furthermore we earn substantial revenue from customer with nearly exclusive relationship with our competitor such relationship could provide advantage to the customer to shift business from to the competitor with which they are principally aligned significant loss of our existing revenue or transaction volume from these customer could have material adverse impact on our business mastercard form kpart iitem risk factorsconsolidation amongst our customer could materially and adversely

mastercard portfolio being acquired by institution with strong relationship with competitor if significant consolidation among customer were to continue it could result in the substantial loss of business for which could have material adverse impact on our business and prospect in addition one or more of our customer could seek to merge with or acquire one of our competitor and any such transaction could also have material adverse impact on our overall business consolidation could also produce smaller number of large customer which could increase their bargaining power and lead to lower price and or more favorable term for our customer these development could materially and adversely affect our result of operation our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and in many jurisdiction their ability to effectively manage or help manage our brand while we work directly with many stakeholder in the payment system including merchant government fintechs and large digital company and other technology company we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on our relationship with our issuer and acquirer and their respective relationship with account holder and merchant to support our program and service furthermore we depend on our issuing partner and acquirer to continue to innovate to maintain competitiveness in the market we do not issue card or other payment device extend credit to account holder or determine the interest rate or other fee charged to account holder each issuer determines these and most other competitive payment program feature in addition we do not establish the discount rate that merchant are charged for acceptance which is the responsibility of our acquiring customer result our business significantly depends on the continued success and competitiveness of our issuing and acquiring customer and the strength of our relationship with them in turn our customer success depends on variety of factor over which we have little or no influence including economic condition in global financial market or their disintermediation by competitor or emerging

information on currency impact key metricsin addition to the financial measure described above in financial result overview we review the following metric to evaluate and identify trend in our business measure our performance prepare financial projection and make strategic decision we believe that the key metric presented facilitate an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide meaningful comparison of our result between period operating margin measure how much profit we make on each dollar of sale after our operating cost but other income expense and income tax expense operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue key driver gross dollar volume gdv measure dollar volume of activity including both domestic and cross border volume on card carrying our brand during the period on local currency basis and dollar converted basis gdv represents purchase volume plus cash volume purchase volume mean the aggregate dollar amount of purchase made with mastercard branded card for the relevant period and cash volume mean the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursement and includes the impact of balance transfer and convenience check obtained with mastercard branded card for the relevant period information denominated in dollar relating to gdv is calculated by applying an established dollar local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volume are reported these exchange rate are calculated on quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter we report period over period rate of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information in order to eliminate the impact of change in the value of currency against the dollar in calculating such rate of change mastercard form iiitem management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operationscross border volume measure the growth of cross border dollar volume during the period on local currency basis and dollar converted basis for all mastercard branded program switched measure the number of transaction switched by mastercard which is defined the number of transaction initiated and switched through our network during the period data used in the calculation of gdv is provided by mastercard customer and is subject to verification by mastercard and partial cross checking against information provided by mastercard transaction switching system all data is subject to revision and amendment by mastercard or mastercard customer starting in the first quarter of data related to sanctioned russian bank wa not reported to and therefore such amount are not included subsequent to the suspension of our business operation in russia in march there is no russian data to be reported growth rate are normalized to eliminate the effect of differing switching and carryover day between period carryover day are those where transaction and volume from day where the company doe not clear and settle are processed in the fourth quarter of we began clearing and settling transaction and volume on daily basis the following table provide summary of the growth trend in our key driver for the year ended december decrease usdlocalusdlocalmastercard branded gdv growth united worldwide le united cross border volume growth mastercard branded gdv growth adjusted for russia worldwide le united state gdv growth adjusted for russia cross border volume growth adjusted for russia for the year ended december increase decrease transaction switched transaction growth adjusted for russia excludes volume generated by maestro and cirrus card starting in the first quarter of result of imposed sanction and the suspension of our business operation in russia we have provided adjusted growth rate for our key driver excluding activity from russian issued card from the current and prior period key metric related to the payment networkassessments represent agreed upon standard pricing provided to our customer based on various form of payment related activity assessment are used internally by management to monitor operating performance it allows for comparability and provides visibility into cardholder trend assessment do not represent our net revenue the following provides additional information on our key metric related to the payment network domestic assessment are charge based on activity related to card that carry the company brand where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same these assessment are primarily driven by the domestic dollar volume of activity domestic purchase volume domestic cash volume or the number of card issued cross border assessment are charge based on activity related to card that carry the company brand where the merchant country and the country of issuance are different these assessment are primarily driven by the cross border dollar volume of activity cross border purchase volume cross border cash volume mastercard form kpart iiitem management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation transaction processing assessment are charge primarily driven by the number of switched transaction on our payment network switching activity include authorization the process by which transaction is routed to the issuer for approval clearing the determination and exchange of financial transaction information between issuer and acquirer after transaction ha been successfully conducted at the point of interaction settlement which facilitates the determination and exchange of fund between party these assessment can also include connectivity service and network access which are based on the volume of data transmitted and the number of authorization and settlement message other network assessment are charge for licensing implementation and other franchise fee the following table provides summary of our key metric related to the payment network year ended december decrease currency neutral increase decrease increase decrease currency neutral increase decrease in million domestic assessment cross border transaction processing other network foreign currencycurrency impactour primary revenue functional currency are the dollar euro brazilian real and the british pound our overall operating result are impacted by currency translation which represents the effect of translating operating result where the functional currency is different than our dollar reporting currency our operating result are also impacted by transactional currency the impact of the transactional currency represents the effect of converting revenue and expense transaction occurring in currency other than the functional currency change in currency exchange rate directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume gdv and gross euro volume gev which are used in the calculation of our key metric related to domestic assessment and cross border assessment well certain volume related rebate and incentive in most non european region gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to dollar using average exchange rate for the period in europe gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euro using average exchange rate for the period result our key metric related to domestic assessment and cross border assessment well certain volume related rebate and incentive are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the dollar versus non european local currency and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus other european local currency for example our billing in australia is in the dollar however consumer spend in australia is in the australian dollar the currency transactional impact of converting australian dollar to our dollar billing currency will have an impact on the revenue generated the strengthening or weakening of the dollar is evident when gdv growth on dollar converted basis is compared to gdv growth on local currency basis in gdv on dollar converted basis increased while gdv on local currency basis increased versus in gdv on dollar converted basis increased while gdv on local currency basis increased versus further the impact from transactional currency occurs in transaction processing revenue other revenue and operating expense when the local currency of these item is different than the functional currency of the entity through december our approach to managing transactional currency exposure consisted of hedging portion of anticipated revenue impacted by transactional currency by entering into foreign exchange derivative contract and recording the related change in fair value in general and administrative expense on the
