energy cost account for substantial portion of the company total production cost and operating expense the company purchase hydrocarbon raw material including ethane propane butane naphtha and condensate feedstock and also purchase certain monomer primarily ethylene and propylene to supplement internal production well other raw material the company also purchase natural gas primarily to generate electricity and purchase electric power to supplement internal generation feedstock and energy cost generally follow price trend in crude oil and natural gas which are sometimes volatile while the company us it feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging program to help mitigate feedstock cost increase the company is not always able to immediately raise selling price ultimately the ability to pas on underlying cost increase is dependent on market condition conversely when feedstock and energy cost decline selling price generally decline well result volatility in these cost could impact the company result of operation the company ha number of investment on the gulf coast to take advantage of increasing supply of low cost natural gas and natural gas liquid ngls derived from shale gas including the st charles operation sco ethylene production facility which commenced operation in december an on purpose propylene production facility which commenced operation

and to the consolidated financial statement goodwill the company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level reporting unit are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by business management on regular basis the company test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when event or change in circumstance indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit ha declined below it carrying value goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and or quantitative testing procedure the separation from dowdupont on april did not impact the composition of the company six reporting unit coating performance monomer consumer solution hydrocarbon energy industrial solution packaging and specialty plastic and polyurethane construction chemical the ecp business received part of the separation from dowdupont are included in the hydrocarbon energy and packaging and specialty plastic reporting unit at december goodwill wa carried by five out of six of the company reporting unit the company ha the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value qualitative factor assessed at the company level include but are not limited to gdp growth rate long term hydrocarbon and energy price equity and credit market activity discount rate foreign exchange rate and overall financial performance qualitative factor assessed at the reporting unit level include but are not limited to change in industry and market structure competitive environment planned capacity and new product launch cost factor such raw material price and financial performance of the reporting unit if the company chooses not to complete qualitative assessment for given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of reporting unit is le than it carrying value additional quantitative testing is required quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with it carrying value if the reporting unit carrying value exceeds it fair value an impairment charge is recognized for the difference the company utilizes discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of it reporting unit this valuation technique ha been selected by management the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the company reporting unit however where market comparables are available the company includes ebit ebitda multiple part of the reporting unit valuation analysis the discounted cash flow valuation are completed using the following key assumption projected revenue growth rate or compounded annual growth rate discount rate tax rate terminal value currency exchange rate and forecasted long term hydrocarbon and energy price by geographic region and by year which include the company key feedstock well natural gas and crude oil due to it correlation to naphtha currency exchange rate and long term hydrocarbon and energy price are established for the company whole and applied consistently to all reporting unit while revenue growth rate discount rate and tax rate are established by reporting unit to account for difference in business fundamental and industry risk these key assumption drive projected ebit ebitda and ebit ebitda margin which are key element of management internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis of goodwill impairment testing in there were no event or change in circumstance that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of qualitative testing wa performed for all reporting unit carrying goodwill based on the result of the qualitative testing quantitative testing wa performed on one reporting unit for the qualitative assessment management considered factor at both the company level and the reporting unit level based on the qualitative assessment for the reporting unit management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is le than the carrying value of the reporting unit for the quantitative testing the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit pension and other postretirement benefitsthe amount recognized in the consolidated financial statement related to pension and other postretirement benefit are determined from actuarial valuation inherent in these valuation are assumption including expected return on plan asset discount rate at which the liability could have been settled at december rate of increase in future compensation level mortality rate and health care cost trend rate these assumption are updated annually and are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statement in accordance with gaap actual result that differ from the assumption are accumulated and amortized over future period and therefore affect expense recognized and obligation recorded in future period the pension plan represent percent of the company pension plan asset and percent of the pension obligation the company us the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost component of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost for the and other selected country under the spot rate approach the company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rate from the willis tower watson rate link yield curve based on high quality corporate bond yield for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow component of service cost and interest cost service cost and interest cost for all other plan including all plan prior to adoption are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rate derived in determining those plan obligation the following information relates to the plan only similar approach is used for the company non plan the company determines the expected long term rate of return on asset by performing detailed analysis of historical and expected return based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the company investment committee and the underlying return fundamental of each asset class the company historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered the expected return of each asset class is derived from forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience the expected long term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year the weighted average long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for wa percent the weighted average assumption to be used for determining net periodic pension expense is percent future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance change in future discount rate and various other factor related to the population of participant in the company pension plan the discount rate utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligation of the qualified plan are based on the yield on high quality corporate fixed income investment at the measurement date future expected actuarially determined cash flow for the company plan are individually discounted at the spot rate under the willis tower watson rate link corporate yield curve based on to percentile high quality corporate bond yield to arrive at the plan obligation of the measurement date the weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligation decreased to percent at december from percent at december at december the qualified plan were underfunded on projected benefit obligation basis by million the underfunded amount increased million compared with december the increase in the underfunded amount in wa primarily due to the impact of lower discount rate which wa partially offset by overall favorable asset return the company did not make contribution to the qualified plan in the assumption for the long term rate for the compensation level for the qualified plan wa unchanged the company us generational mortality table to determine the duration of it pension and other postretirement obligation of contentsthe following discussion relates to the company significant pension plan the company base the determination of pension expense on market related valuation of plan asset that reduces year to year volatility this market related valuation recognizes investment gain or loss over five year period from the year in which they occur investment gain or loss for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of plan asset and the actual return based on the market value of plan asset since the market related value of plan asset recognizes gain or loss over five year period the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gain or loss are recorded over the life of the plan both gain and loss have been recognized and amortized at december net gain of million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of plan asset these net gain will result in decrease in future pension expense they are recognized in the market related value of asset the net increase in the market related value of asset due to the recognition of prior gain is presented in the following table net increase in market related asset value due to recognition of prior gainsin total at december the company expects pension expense to decrease in by approximately million the decrease in pension expense is primarily due to the lower interest cost component basis point increase or decrease in the long term return on asset assumption would change the company total pension expense for by million basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the company total pension expense for by million basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the company total pension expense for by million basis point change in the long term return and discount rate assumption would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for income taxesdeferred tax asset and liability are determined based on temporary difference between the financial reporting and tax base of asset and liability applying enacted tax rate expected to be in effect for the year in which the difference are expected to reverse based on the evaluation of available evidence both positive and negative the company recognizes future tax benefit such net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to the extent that realizing these benefit is considered to be more likely than not at december the company had net deferred tax asset balance of million after valuation allowance of million in evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax asset the company relies on in order of increasing subjectivity taxable income in prior carryback year the future reversal of existing

climate change matter for the company are likely to be driven by several category of risk related to the transition to lower carbon economy transition risk and risk related to the physical impact of climate change physical risk transition riskstransition risk include carbon pricing mechanism transition to lower emission technology increased cost of raw material and mandate on and regulation of existing product and service carbon pricing is market based strategy for lowering global warming emission by putting monetary value on carbon emission allowing for the cost of climate impact and opportunity for low carbon energy option to be reflected in production and consumption choice approximately percent of dow carbon emission are generated from operation in canada and the european union eu where carbon pricing is already in place part of the european green deal the european commission proposed greenhouse gas ghg emission reduction target of at least percent below level with goal for the eu to be carbon neutral by in china an emission trading system initially proposed to cover the power sector only is expected to gradually expand to cover total of eight sector including the petrochemical and chemical industry though no specific timeline for implementation and expansion ha been outlined these carbon pricing mechanism will not only increase dow direct cost to operate but will also result in increased energy cost dow mitigates the direct cost impact of existing regulation through research and development project designed to increase energy efficiency and capital investment project that will reduce the company energy usage and carbon footprint the company is also exploring option for carbon capture utilization and storage ccus and electrification of dow process dow see ccus mechanism to help bridge the time period between the onset of increased carbon regulation and the technology available to economically reduce dow ghg emission dow also incorporates theoretical internal carbon price into it business planning and risk management strategy this theoretical price of carbon is also included in internal calculation used for prioritizing capital project ultimately the goal of utilizing an internal carbon price is to mitigate the risk of dow carbon exposure to help ensure future resiliency physical risksoperationally climate change may result in more frequent severe weather event potential change in precipitation pattern and extreme variability in weather pattern which can disrupt operation several of dow production facility are located in water scarce area and water shortage could impact normal production change in average precipitation could have an impact on the availability and price of water the company ha engineered susceptible facility particularly on the gulf coast to better withstand severe weather and rising sea level and continues to study the long term implication of changing climate parameter on water availability plant siting issue and other impact preparedness plan are developed that detail action needed in the event of severe weather these measure have historically been in place and these activity and associated cost are driven by normal operational preparedness in the most recent period for which data is available the company greenhouse gas intensity wa down approximately percent from and by total of approximately percent since the baseline year of in addition the company is on track to meet it target of purchasing megawatt of renewable power by the company continues progress toward it defined sustainability goal and is taking further action to lessen it carbon impact moving forward in june the company announced new multi decade carbon target to reduce it net annual carbon emission by million metric ton compared with it baseline reduction of approximately percent and an intention to be carbon neutral scope defined by the greenhouse gas protocol plus product benefit by of contentsdow action plan to achieve carbon neutrality by includes optimizing energy efficiency of facility and process increasing renewables in purchased power mix investment in ccus developing low carbon technology for emission reduction deploying material to enable emission reduction for customer and industriesthe company intends to meet it commitment to implement the recommendation of the

liability including defense and processing cost reflect reasonable and probable estimate of the liability based upon current known fact however future event such the number of new claim to be filed and or received each year the average cost of defending and disposing of each such claim well the numerous uncertainty surrounding asbestos litigation in the united state over significant period of time could cause the actual cost for union carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded any such event could result in an increase or decrease in the recorded liability because of the uncertainty described above union carbide can not estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos related claim facing union carbide and amchem result it is
