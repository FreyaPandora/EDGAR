employeeson december our subsidiary employee approximately one fifth of work under collective agreement with various labor union and worker representative agreement covering approximately of total employee are due to expire in historically we have renegotiated these labor agreement without any significant disruption to operating activity raw material supplier and seasonalitywe depend on supplier and subcontractor for raw material component and subsystem our government customer is supplier on some of our program these supply network can experience price fluctuation and capacity constraint which can put pressure on our cost effective management and oversight of supplier and subcontractor is an important element of our successful performance we sometimes rely on only one or two source of supply that if disrupted could impact our ability to meet our customer commitment we attempt to mitigate risk with our supplier by entering into long term agreement and leveraging company wide agreement to achieve economy of scale and by negotiating flexible pricing term in our customer contract we have not experienced and not foresee significant difficulty in obtaining the material component or supply necessary for our business operation our business is not seasonal in nature the receipt of contract award the availability of funding from the customer the incurrence of contract cost and unit delivery are all factor that influence the timing of our revenue in the united state these factor are influenced by the federal government budget cycle based on it october to

environmental agency prp we are potentially liable to the government or third party for the cost of remediating contamination in case where we have been designated prp we generally seek to mitigate these environmental liability through available insurance coverage and by pursuing appropriate cost recovery action in the unlikely event that we are required to fully fund the remediation of site the current statutory framework would allow to pursue contribution from other prps we regularly ass our compliance status and management of environmental matter operating and maintenance cost associated

contained in this annual report on form before deciding whether to purchase our security investment risk can be market wide well unique to specific industry or company the market risk faced by an investor in our stock are similar to the uncertainty faced by investor in broad range of industry there are some risk that apply more specifically to our business our revenue is concentrated with the government this customer relationship involves some specific risk in addition our sale to non customer expose to different financial and legal risk despite the varying nature of our government and commercial operation and the market they serve each segment share some common risk such the ongoing development of high technology product and the price availability and quality of commodity and subsystem the government provides significant portion of our revenue in approximately of our consolidated revenue wa from the government level of defense spending are driven by threat to national security competing demand for federal fund can pressure various area of spending decrease in government defense and other spending or change in spending allocation or priority could result in one or more of our program reduced delayed or terminated which could impact our financial performance for additional information relating to budget matter see the business environment section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation in item government contract are not always fully funded at inception and any funding is subject to disruption or delay our government revenue is funded by agency budget that operate on an october to september fiscal year early each calendar year the president of the united state present to the congress the budget for the upcoming fiscal year this budget proposes funding level for every federal agency and is the result of month of policy and program review throughout the executive branch for the remainder of the year the appropriation and authorization committee of the congress review the president budget proposal and establish the funding level for the upcoming fiscal year once these level are enacted into law the executive office of the president administers the fund to the agency are two primary risk associated with the government budget cycle first the annual process may be delayed or disrupted if the annual budget is not approved by the beginning of the government fiscal year portion of the government can shut or operate under continuing resolution that maintains spending at prior year level which can impact funding for our program and timing of new award second the congress typically appropriates fund on fiscal year basis even though contract performance may extend over many year future revenue under existing multi year contract is conditioned on the continuing availability of congressional appropriation change in appropriation in subsequent year may impact the funding available for these program delay or change in funding can impact the timing of available fund or lead to change in program content our government contract are subject to termination right by the customer government contract generally permit the government to terminate contract in whole or in part for convenience if contract is terminated for convenience contractor usually is entitled to receive payment for it allowable cost incurred and the proportionate share of fee or earnings for the work performed the government may also terminate contract for default in the event of breach by the contractor if contract is terminated for default the government in most case pay only for the work it ha accepted the termination of multiple or large program could have material adverse effect on our

contractor cost not being reimbursed or subject to repayment if an audit or investigation were to result in allegation against contractor of improper or illegal activity civil or criminal penalty and administrative sanction could result including termination of contract forfeiture of profit suspension of payment fine and suspension or prohibition from business with the government in addition reputational harm could result if allegation of impropriety were made in some case audit may result in dispute with the respective government agency that can result in negotiated settlement arbitration or litigation moreover new law regulation or standard or change to existing one can increase our performance and compliance cost and reduce our profitability our aerospace segment is subject to changing customer demand for business aircraft the business jet market is driven by the demand for business aviation product and service by corporate individual and government customer in the united state and around the world the aerospace segment result also depend on other factor including general economic condition the availability of credit pricing pressure and trend in capital good market in addition if customer default on existing contract and the contract are not replaced the segment anticipated revenue and profitability could be reduced materially earnings and margin depend on our ability to perform on our contract when agreeing to contractual term our management team make assumption and projection about future condition and event the accounting for our contract and program requires assumption and estimate about these condition and event these projection and estimate ass the productivity and availability of labor the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material and component and schedule requirement there is significant change in one or more of these circumstance estimate or assumption or if the risk under our contract are not managed adequately the profitability of contract could be adversely affected this could affect earnings and margin materially earnings and margin depend in part on subcontractor and vendor performance we rely on other company to provide material component and subsystem for our product subcontractor also perform some of the service that we provide to our customer we depend on these subcontractor and vendor to meet our contractual obligation in full compliance with customer requirement and applicable law misconduct by subcontractor such failure to comply with procurement regulation or engaging in unauthorized activity may harm our future revenue and earnings we manage our supplier base carefully to avoid or minimize customer issue we sometimes rely on only one or two source of supply that if disrupted could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customer commitment our ability to perform our obligation may be materially adversely affected if one or more of these supplier is unable to provide the agreed upon material perform the agreed upon service in timely and cost effective manner or engages in misconduct or other improper activity sale and operation outside the united state are subject to different risk that may be associated with doing business in foreign country in some country there is increased chance for economic legal or political change and procurement procedure may be le robust or mature which may complicate the contracting process our non operation may be sensitive to and impacted by change in foreign government national policy and priority political leadership and budget which may be influenced by change in threat environment geopolitical uncertainty volatility in economic condition and other economic and political factor change and development in any of these matter or factor may occur suddenly and could impact funding for program or delay purchasing decision or customer payment non transaction can involve increased financial and legal risk arising from foreign exchange rate variability and differing legal system our non operation are subject to and foreign law and regulation including law and regulation relating to import export control technology transfer the foreign corrupt practice act fcpa and other anti corruption law and the international traffic in arm regulation itar an unfavorable event or trend in any one or more of these factor or failure to comply with or foreign law could result in administrative civil or criminal liability including suspension or debarment from government contract or suspension of our export privilege and could materially adversely affect revenue and earnings associated with our non operation in addition some non government customer require contractor to enter into letter of credit performance or surety bond bank guarantee and other similar financial arrangement we may also be required to agree to specific in country purchase manufacturing agreement or financial support arrangement known offset that require to satisfy investment or other requirement or face penalty offset requirement may extend over several year and could require to team with local company to fulfill these requirement if we do not satisfy these financial or offset requirement our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected our future success depends in part on our ability to develop new product and technology and maintain qualified workforce to meet the need of our customer many of the product and service we provide involve sophisticated technology and engineering with related complex manufacturing and system integration process our customer requirement change and evolve regularly accordingly our future performance depends in part on our ability to continue to develop manufacture and provide innovative product and service and bring those offering to market quickly at cost effective price some new product particularly in our aerospace segment must meet extensive and time consuming regulatory requirement that are often outside our control and may result in unanticipated delay additionally due the highly specialized nature of our business we must hire and retain the skilled and qualified personnel necessary to perform the service required by our customer to the extent that the demand for skilled personnel exceeds supply we could experience higher labor recruiting or training cost in order to attract and retain such employee if we were unable to develop new product that meet customer changing need and satisfy regulatory requirement in timely manner or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel our future revenue and earnings may be materially adversely affected we have made and expect to continue to make investment including acquisition and joint venture that involve risk and uncertainty when evaluating potential acquisition and joint venture we make judgment regarding the value of business opportunity technology and other asset and the risk and cost of potential liability based on information available to at the time of the transaction whether we realize the anticipated benefit from these transaction depends on multiple factor including our integration of the business involved the performance of the underlying product capability or technology market condition following the acquisition and acquired liability including some that may not have been identified prior to the acquisition these factor could materially adversely affect our financial result change in business

approximately of our revenue from the government government spending level particularly defense spending influence our financial performance over the past several year defense spending ha been mandated by the budget control act of bca the bca establishes spending cap over year period through including sequester mechanism that would impose additional defense cut if an annual defense appropriation bill is enacted the spending cap on august the bipartisan budget act of bba wa signed into law which raised discretionary spending limit established by the bca for fiscal year fy and fy on december the fy defense appropriation bill wa signed into law it totaled billion and included billion in the base budget in compliance with the bba spending cap and billion for overseas contingency operation representing an increase of approximately over the total fy spending level the long term outlook for our defense business is influenced by the military funding priority the diversity of our program and customer our insight into customer requirement stemming from our incumbency on core program our ability to evolve our product to address fast changing threat environment and our proven track record of successful contract execution international demand for military equipment and information technology present opportunity for our non operation and export from our north american business while the revenue potential can be significant there are risk to doing business in foreign country including changing budget priority and overall spending pressure unique to each country in our aerospace segment we continue to experience strong demand across our product portfolio we expect our investment in the development of new aircraft product and technology to support the aerospace segment long term growth similarly we believe the aircraft service business will be source of steady revenue growth the global business jet fleet continues to grow of operationsintroductionan understanding of our accounting practice is necessary in the evaluation of our financial statement and operating result the following paragraph explain we recognize revenue and operating cost in our operating segment and the terminology we use to describe our operating result in the aerospace segment we record revenue on contract for new aircraft when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft revenue associated with the segment custom completion of narrow body and wide body aircraft and the segment service business is recognized work progress or upon delivery of service fluctuation in revenue from period to period result from the number and mix of new aircraft delivery progress on aircraft completion and the level and type of aircraft service performed during the period the majority of the aerospace segment operating cost relates to new aircraft production on firm order and consists of labor material subcontractor and overhead cost the cost are accumulated in production lot recorded in inventory and recognized operating cost at aircraft delivery based on the estimated average unit cost in production lot while change in the estimated average unit cost for production lot impact the level of operating cost the amount of operating cost reported in given period is based largely on the number and type of aircraft delivered operating cost in the aerospace segment completion and service business are recognized generally incurred for new aircraft operating earnings and margin are function of the price of our aircraft our operational efficiency in manufacturing and outfitting the aircraft and the mix of ultra large cabin large cabin and mid cabin aircraft delivery aircraft mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our aircraft model new aircraft model typically ha lower margin in it initial production lot and then margin generally increase we realize efficiency in the production process additional factor affecting the segment earnings and margin include the volume mix and profitability of completion and service work performed the volume of and market for pre owned aircraft and the level of general and administrative and net research and development cost incurred by the segment in the defense segment revenue on long term government contract is recognized generally over time the work progress either product are produced or service are rendered typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense variance in cost recognized from period to period reflect primarily increase and decrease in production or activity level on individual contract cost are used measure of progress year over year variance in cost result in corresponding variance in revenue which we generally refer to volume operating earnings and margin in the defense segment are driven by change in volume performance or contract mix performance refers to change in profitability based on adjustment to estimate at completion on individual contract these adjustment result from increase or decrease to the estimated value of the contract the estimated cost to complete the contract or both therefore change in cost incurred in the period compared with prior period do not necessarily impact profitability it is only when total estimated cost at completion on given contract change without corresponding change in the contract value or vice versa that the profitability of that contract may be impacted contract mix refers to change in the volume of higher versus lower margin work higher or lower margin can result from of factor including contract type fixed price cost reimbursable and type of work development production contract mix can also refer to the stage of program maturity for our long term production contract new long term production contract typically have lower margin initially and then margin generally increase we achieve learning curve improvement or realize other cost reduction consolidated in review record high operating performance revenue of billion with growth in all of our segment operating earnings of billion an increase of from earnings from continuing operation per diluted share of an increase of from record high backlog of billion increased billion or from supporting our long term growth expectation net order for gulfstream aircraft increased over from and reflected significant demand for the new aircraft several significant contract award received in in our defense segment including billion for block of the virginia class submarine program in our marine system segment the largest shipbuilding contract in the navy history year ended december variancerevenue operating cost and expense operating operating our consolidated revenue increased in driven by delivery of the new and aircraft in our aerospace segment and new contract from the government for military vehicle in our combat system segment and submarine in our marine system segment operating margin decreased in due primarily to the transition from mature product and contract to newer one which typically have lower initial margin review of operating segmentsfollowing is discussion of operating result and outlook for each of our operating segment for the aerospace segment result are analyzed by specific type of product and service consistent with how the segment is managed for the defense segment the discussion is based on market and the line of product and service offered with supplemental discussion of specific contract and program when significant to the result additional information regarding our segment can be found in note to the consolidated financial statement in item ended december variancerevenue operating operating gulfstream aircraft delivery in unit operating resultsthe increase in the aerospace segment revenue in consisted of the following aircraft manufacturing service and owned increase manufacturing revenue increased primarily from the initial delivery of the new large cabin aircraft which entered into service in the third quarter of and additional delivery of the large cabin aircraft which entered into service in the third quarter of the increase in aircraft service and completion revenue wa driven by higher demand for maintenance work and the acquisition in the second quarter of of hawker pacific leading provider of aircraft service across the asia pacific region and the middle east additionally we had fifteen pre owned aircraft sale in compared with seven in the increase in the segment operating earnings in consisted of the following aircraft manufacturing service and owned aircraft other expense total increase manufacturing operating earnings were up due to additional delivery in driven by the introduction into service of the and increased production of the the growth in revenue outpaced the earnings growth due to lower margin associated with the which are typical of new aircraft model we expect the operating margin associated with both the and to increase over time manufacturing learning curve improvement are achieved net other expense were up in due to nonrecurring cost associated with reduction in our employee workforce in the fourth quarter of related primarily to streamlining support and administrative function this increase wa offset partially by lower expense in which ha been trending downward with the completion of the and aircraft test program offset partially by increased activity associated with the development of the new aircraft model in total the aerospace segment operating margin decreased basis point to outlookwe expect the aerospace segment revenue to be around billion with operating margin in the to range combat systemsyear ended december variancerevenue operating operating operating resultsthe increase in the combat system segment revenue in consisted of the following military vehicle system and military increase wa up across the combat system segment in revenue from military vehicle increased due primarily to higher volume on the army abrams system enhancement package version tank and new mobile protected firepower mpf vehicle program weapon system and munition revenue wa up from increased volume on several product including hydra rocket and other artillery for the army and missile subcomponents revenue from international military vehicle increased on higher tank program volume the combat system segment operating margin decreased basis point compared with driven by new contract with initially lower margin in our military vehicle business and an unfavorable settlement in the first quarter of relating to lease at former operating site outside the united state outlookwe expect the combat system segment revenue to be about billion with operating margin of approximately information technologyyear ended december variancerevenue operating earnings operating resultsthe increase in the information technology segment revenue in consisted of the following defense civilian intelligence and homeland security total increase increased due to an additional quarter of csra volume the business wa acquired in the second quarter of this increase wa offset partially by lower revenue in our federal civilian business result of the sale of the segment public facing contact center business in the fourth quarter of and other portfolio shaping following the csra acquisition revenue in our intelligence and homeland security business wa lower due to the timing of completion of several legacy program in versus the start up of new program operating margin increased basis point compared with due largely to acquisition related synergy outlookwe expect the information technology segment revenue to be between and billion with operating margin of approximately mission systemsyear ended december variancerevenue operating earnings operating operating resultsthe increase in the mission system segment revenue in consisted of the following naval air and electronic system system and intelligence and cyber increase wa up across the mission system segment in increased volume on combat and seaframe control system for the navy independence variant littoral combat ship lcss and fire control system for the navy submarine program drove the increase in the naval air and electronic system business ground system and product revenue wa up due to higher demand for computing and communication equipment the mission system segment operating margin decreased slightly in due primarily to mix outlookwe expect the mission system segment revenue to be between and billion with operating margin of approximately systemsyear ended december variancerevenue operating operating operating resultsthe increase in the marine system segment revenue in consisted of the following navy ship construction navy ship engineering repair and other ship construction total increase from navy ship construction wa up due to higher volume on block of the virginia class submarine program the columbia class submarine program and the arleigh burke class ddg destroyer program offset somewhat by lower virginia class block iii volume revenue from navy ship engineering repair and other service increased driven by higher volume of surface ship repair work these increase were offset partially by lower commercial ship construction volume at our nassco shipyard the marine system segment operating margin decreased basis point in due primarily to mix shift in our submarine and auxiliary ship workload to newer contract with lower initial margin outlookwe expect the marine system segment revenue to be approximately billion with operating margin of around corporatecorporate operating result consisted of the following year ended december income expense corporate operating result in included one time transaction related charge of approximately associated with the cost to complete the csra acquisition excluding these charge corporate operating result have two primary component pension and other post retirement benefit income and stock option expense we are required to report the non service cost component of pension and other post retirement benefit cost interest cost in other income expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in our defense segment pension and other post retirement benefit cost are recoverable contract cost therefore the non service cost component are included in the operating result of these segment but an offset is reported in corporate this amount exceeded our stock option expense in and informationproduct and service revenue and operating costsyear ended december variancerevenue product operating cost product service the increase in product revenue in consisted of the following aircraft manufacturing vehicle product system and increase command control communication computer intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance solution in our mission system segmentaircraft manufacturing revenue increased due primarily to the initial delivery of the new large cabin aircraft and additional delivery of the large cabin aircraft ship construction revenue increased due to higher volume on block of the virginia class submarine program the columbia class submarine program and the ddg destroyer program offset bit by lower commercial ship construction volume military vehicle production revenue increased due primarily to higher volume on the army abrams tank and new mpf vehicle program product revenue wa up due primarily to increased volume on combat and seaframe control system for navy surface ship and computing and communication equipment product operating cost increased at higher rate than revenue due primarily to mix change from mature program to new production program the increase in service revenue in consisted of the following it service increase service revenue increased due to the csra acquisition in the second quarter of offset partially by the sale of public facing contact center business in our information technology segment in the fourth quarter of service operating cost increased consistent with the change in volume described above expensesas percentage of revenue expense were in and in we expect expense percentage of revenue in to be generally consistent with netnet interest expense wa in and in the increase wa due primarily to the impact of financing the csra acquisition including the issuance of billion of fixed and floating rate note in the second quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for additional information regarding our debt obligation including interest rate we expect net interest expense to be approximately reflecting our next scheduled debt maturity of billion in the second quarter of other netnet other income wa in compared with expense of in the expense included approximately of transaction cost associated with the csra acquisition excluding these transaction cost other represents primarily the non service cost component of pension and other post retirement benefit which were net income item in both period provision for income tax netour effective tax rate wa in and in the decrease in our effective tax rate in is due primarily to increased tax credit and favorable regulatory development associated with

have an effective shelf registration on file with the security and exchange commission that allows to access the debt market non gaap financial measureswe emphasize the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder return described below we use free cash flow from operation and return on invested capital roic to measure our performance in these area while we believe these metric provide useful information they are not defined operating measure under generally accepted accounting principle gaap and there are limitation associated with their use our calculation of these metric may not be completely comparable to similarly titled measure of other company due to potential difference in the method of calculation result the use of these metric should not be considered in isolation from or substitute for other gaap measure free cash flow we define free cash flow from operation net cash provided by operating activity le capital expenditure we believe free cash flow from operation is useful measure for investor because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our business for purpose such repaying maturing debt funding business acquisition repurchasing our common stock and paying dividend we use free cash flow from operation to ass the quality of our earnings and key performance measure in evaluating management the following table reconciles the free cash flow from operation with net cash provided by operating activity classified on the consolidated statement of cash flow in item year ended december cash provided by operating activity expenditure free cash flow from operation flow percentage of earnings from continuing operation net cash provided by operating free cash flow from on invested capital we believe roic is useful measure for investor because it reflects our ability to generate return from the capital we have deployed in our operation we use roic to evaluate investment decision and performance measure in evaluating management we define roic net operating profit after tax divided by average invested capital net operating profit after tax is defined earnings from continuing operation plus after tax interest and amortization expense calculated using the statutory federal income tax rate average invested capital is defined the sum of the average debt and shareholder equity

timing of delivery this amount includes billion of purchase obligation for product and service to be delivered under firm government contract under which we would expect full recourse under normal contract termination clause represents other long term liability on our consolidated balance sheet including the current portion of these liability the projected timing of cash flow associated with these obligation is based on management estimate which are based largely on historical experience this amount also includes all liability under our defined benefit retirement plan see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding these liability and the plan asset available to satisfy them amount of commitment expiration by periodcommercial commitmentstotal amount committed le than year year year more than yearsletters of credit and guarantee trade in option see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of letter of credit and aircraft trade in option application of critical accounting policiesmanagement discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operation is based on our consolidated financial statement which have been prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statement in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimate and assumption that affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimate including most pervasively those related to various assumption and projection for our long term contract and program other significant estimate include those related to goodwill and intangible asset income tax pension and other post retirement benefit worker compensation warranty obligation and litigation contingency we employ judgment in making our estimate but they are based on historical experience currently available information and various other assumption that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance these estimate form the basis for making judgment about the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate we believe our judgment is applied consistently and produce financial information that fairly depicts the result of operation for all period presented in our opinion the following policy are critical and require the use of significant judgment in their application revenue performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time substantially all of our revenue in the defense segment is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customer typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense the majority of our revenue recognized at point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contract is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft the majority of our revenue is derived from long term contract and program that can span several year accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost for long term contract we estimate the profit on contract the difference the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including claim and award and incentive fee we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract modification or claim against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimate are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amount they are included in the transaction price of our contract and the associated remaining performance obligation significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit on contract under the cumulative catch up method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future period of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate the aggregate impact of adjustment in contract estimate increased our operating earnings and diluted earnings per share by in and in no adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or consistent with industry practice we classify asset and liability related to long term contract current even though some of these amount may not be realized within one year the timing of revenue recognition billing and cash collection result in billed account receivable unbilled receivables contract asset and customer advance and deposit contract liability on the consolidated balance sheet these asset and liability are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period long lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired in business combination we review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting unit or when circumstance indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than such circumstance include significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting unit or decision to dispose of reporting unit or significant portion of reporting unit our reporting unit are consistent with our operating segment in note to the consolidated financial statement in item we use both qualitative and quantitative approach when testing goodwill for impairment when determining the approach to be used we consider the current fact and circumstance of each reporting well the excess of each reporting unit estimated fair value over it carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessment our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various event impacting the reporting unit including but not limited to macroeconomic condition change in the business environment and reporting unit specific event if based on the qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of reporting unit is greater than it carrying value then quantitative assessment is not necessary however if quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary we use two step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit by comparing it fair value to it carrying value and then if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss our estimate of fair value is based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation and requires the use of judgment by management the process requires numerous assumption including the timing of work embedded in our backlog our performance and profitability under our contract our success in securing future business the appropriate risk adjusted interest rate used to discount the projected cash flow and terminal value growth rate applied to the final year of projected cash flow due to the variable inherent in our estimate of fair value difference in assumption may have material effect on the result of our impairment analysis to ass the reasonableness of our discounted projected cash flow we compare the sum of our reporting unit fair value to our market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess of the market capitalization over the sum of the reporting unit fair value additionally we evaluate the reasonableness of each reporting unit fair value by comparing the fair value to comparable peer company and recent comparable market transaction of december we completed qualitative assessment for our aerospace combat system mission system and marine system reporting unit the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit significantly exceeded the respective carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessment which were performed of december our qualitative assessment did not present indicator of impairment for these reporting unit of december of december we completed quantitative assessment for our information technology reporting unit and the result indicated that no impairment existed the information technology reporting unit estimated fair value exceeded it carrying value by approximately reflecting the size of the csra acquisition relative to the information technology reporting unit and it recent acquisition date given that the net book value of this business wa recorded at it fair value at the acquisition date in the reporting unit carrying value by default continues to closely approximate it fair value of december the carrying value and fair value of the information technology reporting unit are closely aligned material change in the fair value or carrying value could put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment for example if the synergy from the acquisition or funding in the government budget for our contract fall significantly below our projection the fair value of the reporting unit would be negatively impacted similarly an increase in interest rate would lower our discounted cash flow and negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit we believe the projection and assumption we used in estimating fair value are reasonable but it is possible actual experience could differ impacting our fair value estimate commitment and contingency we are subject to litigation and other legal proceeding arising either from the normal course of business or under provision relating to the protection of the environment estimating liability and cost associated with these matter requires the use of judgment we record charge against earnings when liability associated with claim or pending or threatened litigation is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matter may change further fact and circumstance become known contract cost other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we have elected to defer these cost in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet they can be allocated to contract we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract we regularly ass the probability of recovery of these cost this assessment requires that we make assumption about future contract cost the extent of cost recovery under our contract and the amount of future contract activity these estimate are based on our best judgment if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected retirement plan our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit cost and obligation depend on several assumption and estimate the key assumption include interest rate used to discount estimated future liability and projected long term rate of return on plan asset we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period we use the spot rate approach to identify individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy for we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary other post retirement benefit plan by basis point following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class these retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition in the event any of the assumption change pension and other post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease for further discussion about our retirement plan assumption see note to the consolidated financial statement in item discussed under other contract cost our contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of benefit cost for our government retirement plan we have elected to defer recognition of the benefit cost until such cost can be allocated to contract therefore the impact of annual change in financial reporting assumption on the retirement benefit cost for these plan doe not immediately affect our operating result accounting standard update see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for information regarding accounting standard we adopted in and other new accounting standard that have been issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb but are not effective until after december item quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market riskwe are exposed to market risk primarily from foreign currency exchange rate interest rate commodity price and investment see note to the consolidated financial statement in item for discussion of these risk the following quantifies the market risk exposure arising from hypothetical change in foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate had notional forward exchange and interest rate swap contract outstanding of billion and billion on december and respectively unfavorable rate movement in our portfolio of forward exchange and interest rate swap contract would have resulted in the following hypothetical incremental pretax gain loss dollar in million foreign currency risk our exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to change in the canadian dollar euro swiss franc and british pound exchange rate these loss and gain would be offset by corresponding gain and loss in the remeasurement of the underlying transaction being hedged

all inter company balance and transaction in the consolidated financial statement some prior year amount have been reclassified among financial statement account or disclosure to conform to the current year presentation consistent with industry practice we classify asset and liability related to long term contract current even though some of these amount may not be realized within one year further discussion of our significant accounting policy is contained in the other note to these financial statement use of estimate the nature of our business requires that we make estimate and assumption in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle gaap these estimate and assumption affect the reported amount of asset and liability and the disclosure of contingent asset and liability at the date of the financial statement well the reported amount of revenue and expense during the reporting period we base our estimate on historical experience currently available information and various other assumption that we believe are reasonable under the circumstance actual result could differ from these estimate discontinued operation net of tax on april we completed our acquisition of csra inc csra see note for further discussion of the acquisition in the third quarter of we disposed of csra operation to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to service provided to government customer in accordance with gaap the sale did not result in gain for financial reporting purpose however the sale generated taxable gain resulting in tax expense of research and development expense company sponsored research and development expense including aerospace product development cost were in in and in expense have trended downward over the three year period with the completion of the and aircraft test program offset partially by increased activity associated with the development of the new aircraft model expense are included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings in the period in which they are incurred customer sponsored expense are charged directly to the related contract the aerospace segment ha cost sharing arrangement with some of it supplier that enhance the segment internal development capability and offset portion of the financial cost associated with the segment product development effort these arrangement explicitly state that supplier contribution are for reimbursement of cost we incur in the development of new aircraft model and technology and we retain substantial right in the product developed under these arrangement we record amount received from these cost sharing arrangement reduction of expense we have no obligation to refund amount received under the agreement regardless of the outcome of the development effort under the typical term of an agreement payment received from supplier for their share of the cost are based on milestone and are recognized received our policy is to defer payment in excess of the cost we have incurred interest net net interest expense consisted of the following year ended december expense income interest expense net increase in and is due primarily to the impact of financing the csra acquisition including the issuance of billion of fixed and floating rate note in the second quarter of see note for additional information regarding our debt obligation including interest rate cash and equivalent and investment in debt and equity security we consider security with maturity of three month or le to be cash equivalent our cash balance are invested primarily in time deposit rated or higher our investment in other security are included in other current and noncurrent asset on the consolidated balance sheet see note we report our equity security at fair value with subsequent change in fair value recognized in net earnings we report our available for sale debt security at fair value with unrealized gain and loss recognized component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income we had no trading or held to maturity debt security on december or other contract cost other contract cost represent amount that are not currently allocable to government contract such portion of our estimated worker compensation obligation other insurance related assessment pension and other post retirement benefit and environmental expense these cost will become allocable to contract generally after they are paid we expect to recover these cost through ongoing business including existing backlog and probable follow on contract if the backlog in the future doe not support the continued deferral of these cost the profitability of our remaining contract could be adversely affected other contract cost on december and were and respectively and are included in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet long lived asset and goodwill we review long lived asset including intangible asset subject to amortization for impairment whenever event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable we ass the recoverability of the carrying value of asset held for use based on review of undiscounted projected cash flow impairment loss where identified are measured the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over it estimated fair value determined by discounted projected cash flow goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired in business combination we review goodwill for impairment annually at each of our reporting unit or when circumstance indicate that the likelihood of an impairment is greater than our reporting unit are consistent with our operating segment in note we use both qualitative and quantitative approach when testing goodwill for impairment when determining the approach to be used we consider the current fact and circumstance of each reporting unit well the excess of each reporting unit estimated fair value over it carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessment our qualitative approach evaluates the business environment and various event impacting the reporting unit including but not limited to macroeconomic condition change in the business environment and reporting unit specific event if based on the qualitative assessment we determine that it is more likely than not that fair value of reporting unit is greater than it carrying value then quantitative assessment is not necessary however if quantitative assessment is determined to be necessary we use two step process to first identify potential goodwill impairment for reporting unit by comparing it fair value to it carrying value and then if necessary measure the amount of the impairment loss our estimate of fair value is based primarily on the discounted projected cash flow of the underlying operation of december we completed qualitative assessment for our aerospace combat system mission system and marine system reporting unit the estimated fair value of each of these reporting unit significantly exceeded the respective carrying value based on our most recent quantitative assessment which were performed of december our qualitative assessment did not present indicator of impairment for these reporting unit of december of december we completed quantitative assessment for our information technology reporting unit and the result indicated that no impairment existed the information technology reporting unit estimated fair value exceeded it carrying value by approximately reflecting the size of the csra acquisition relative to the information technology reporting unit and it recent acquisition date given that the net book value of this business wa recorded at it fair value at the acquisition date in the reporting unit carrying value by default continues to closely approximate it fair value of december the carrying value and fair value of the information technology reporting unit are closely aligned material change in the fair value or carrying value could put the reporting unit at risk of goodwill impairment for example if the synergy from the acquisition or funding in the government budget for our contract fall significantly below our projection the fair value of the reporting unit would be negatively impacted similarly an increase in interest rate would lower our discounted cash flow and negatively impact the fair value of the reporting unit we believe the projection and assumption we used in estimating fair value are reasonable but it is possible actual experience could differ impacting our fair value estimate for summary of our goodwill by reporting unit see note accounting standard update on january we adopted the following accounting standard issued by the financial accounting standard board fasb accounting standard codification asc topic lease asc topic requires the recognition of lease right and obligation asset and liability on the balance sheet previously lessee were not required to recognize on the balance sheet asset and liability arising from operating lease we elected the cumulative effect adoption method prior period information ha not been restated the standard provided several optional practical expedient for use in transition we elected to use what the fasb ha deemed the package of practical expedient which allowed not to reassess our previous conclusion about lease identification lease classification and the accounting treatment for initial direct cost we did not elect the practical expedient pertaining to the use of hindsight the most significant effect of the standard on our consolidated financial statement are the recognition of new right of use asset and lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet for our operating lease and significant new disclosure about our leasing activity see note we adopted the standard on january and recognized operating lease liability and right of use asset of billion based on the present value of the remaining lease payment over the lease term the adoption did not result in cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings the new standard did not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow asu compensation retirement benefit defined benefit plan general subtopic disclosure framework change to the disclosure requirement for defined benefit plan asu add remove and clarifies disclosure requirement for defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plan the standard is effective retrospectively on january with early adoption permitted we adopted the standard in and the adoption did not have material effect on our disclosure there are several other accounting standard that have been issued by the fasb but are not yet effective including asu financial instrument credit loss topic measurement of credit loss on financial instrument asu significantly change how entity account for credit loss for financial asset and certain other instrument including trade receivables and contract asset that are not measured at fair value through net income the asu requires number of change to the assessment of credit loss including the utilization of an expected credit loss model which requires consideration of broader range of information to estimate expected credit loss over the entire lifetime of the asset including loss where probability is considered remote additionally the standard requires the estimation of lifetime expected loss for trade receivables and contract asset that are classified current we adopted the standard on january the adoption of the asu did not have material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow acquisition and divestiture goodwill and intangible assetscsra acquisition on april we acquired of the outstanding share of csra for per share in cash plus the assumption of outstanding net debt csra is provider of it solution to the defense intelligence and federal civilian market and is included in our information

continuing earnings per share from continuing operation pro forma information wa prepared by combining our reported historical result with the historical result of csra for the pre acquisition period in addition the reported historical amount were adjusted for the following item net of associated tax effect the impact of acquisition financing the removal of csra operation that we were required by government customer to dispose of to address an organizational conflict of interest with respect to service provided to the customer we completed the sale of these operation in the removal of csra historical pre acquisition intangible asset amortization expense and debt related interest expense the impact of intangible asset amortization expense assuming our estimate of fair value wa applied on january the payment of acquisition related cost assuming they were incurred on january the pro forma information doe not reflect the realization of expected cost saving or synergy from the acquisition and doe not reflect what our combined result of operation would have been had the acquisition occurred on january other acquisition and divestituresin we acquired two business in our aerospace segment and business in our mission system segment for an aggregate of approximately in in addition to the acquisition of csra we acquired five business for an aggregate of approximately hawker pacific leading provider of aircraft service across asia pacific and the middle east and two fixed base operator fbo business in our aerospace segment maintenance and service provider for the german army and other international customer in our combat system segment and provider of specialized transmitter and receiver in our mission system segment in we acquired four business for an aggregate of approximately an fbo in our aerospace segment provider of mission critical support service in our information technology segment and manufacturer of electronics and communication product and manufacturer of signal distribution product in our mission system segment the operating result of these acquisition have been included with our reported result since the respective closing date the purchase price of the acquisition have been allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible asset acquired with any excess purchase price recorded goodwill we completed the sale

in also includes an allocation of goodwill in our mission system reporting unit associated with non core operation classified held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet on december concurrent with the acquisition of csra we reorganized our information system and technology operating segment in accordance with the nature of the segment product and service into the information technology and mission system segment this reorganization similarly changed the composition of our reporting unit accordingly goodwill of the information system and technology reporting unit wa reassigned to the information technology and mission system reporting unit using relative fair value allocation approach of the date of the reorganization goodwill in the information technology and mission system

name and trademark and software intangible asset expense is included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings amortization expense wa in in and in we expect to record annual amortization expense over the next five year follows year ended december revenueperformance obligation performance obligation is promise in contract to transfer distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue contract transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation within that contract and recognized revenue when or the performance obligation is satisfied the majority of our contract have single performance obligation the promise to transfer the individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promise in the contract and is therefore not distinct some of our contract have multiple performance obligation most commonly due to the contract covering multiple phase of the product lifecycle development production maintenance and support for contract with multiple performance obligation we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone price of each distinct good or service in the contract the primary method used to estimate standalone selling price is the expected cost plus margin approach under which we forecast our expected cost of satisfying performance obligation and then add an appropriate margin for that distinct good or service contract modification are routine in the performance of our contract contract are often modified to account for change in contract specification or requirement in most instance contract modification are for good or service that are not distinct and therefore are accounted for part of the existing contract our performance obligation are satisfied over time work progress or at point in time revenue from product and service transferred to customer over time accounted for of our revenue in in and in substantially all of our revenue in the defense segment is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to our customer typically revenue is recognized over time using cost incurred to date relative to total estimated cost at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation incurred cost represents work performed which corresponds with and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer contract cost include labor material overhead and when appropriate expense revenue from good and service transferred to customer at point in time accounted for of our revenue in in and in the majority of our revenue recognized at point in time is for the manufacture of business jet aircraft in our aerospace segment revenue on these contract is recognized when the customer obtains control of the asset which is generally upon delivery and acceptance by the customer of the fully outfitted aircraft on december we had billion of remaining performance obligation which we also refer to total backlog we expect to recognize approximately of our remaining performance obligation revenue in an additional by and the balance thereafter contract estimate the majority of our revenue is derived from long term contract and program that can span several year accounting for long term contract and program involves the use of various technique to estimate total contract revenue and cost for long term contract we estimate the profit on contract the difference between the total estimated revenue and expected cost to complete contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract contract estimate are based on various assumption to project the outcome of future event that often span several year these assumption include labor productivity and availability the complexity of the work to be performed the cost and availability of material the performance of subcontractor and the availability and timing of funding from the customer the nature of our contract give rise to several type of variable consideration including claim and award and incentive fee we include in our contract estimate additional revenue for submitted contract modification or claim against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim the amount can be estimated reliably and it realization is probable in evaluating these criterion we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim the cause of any additional cost incurred the reasonableness of those cost and the objective evidence available to support the claim we include award or incentive fee in the estimated transaction price when there is basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee these estimate are based on historical award experience anticipated performance and our best judgment at the time because of our certainty in estimating these amount they are included in the transaction price of our contract and the associated remaining performance obligation significant change in one or more of these estimate could affect the profitability of our contract we review and update our contract related estimate regularly we recognize adjustment in estimated profit contract under the cumulative catch up method under this method the impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified revenue and profit in future period of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate if at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified the impact of adjustment in contract estimate on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating cost and expense or revenue the aggregate impact of adjustment in contract estimate increased our revenue operating earnings and diluted earnings per share follows year ended december earnings per share adjustment on any one contract wa material to our consolidated financial statement in or revenue by category our portfolio of product and service consists of approximately active

system totalrevenuefixed price reimbursement and revenue ended december fixed price reimbursement and revenue ended december fixed price reimbursement and revenue segment operate under fixed price cost reimbursement and time and material contract our production contract are primarily fixed price under these contract we agree to perform specific scope of work for fixed amount contract for research engineering repair and maintenance and other service are typically cost reimbursement or time and material under cost reimbursement contract the customer reimburses contract cost incurred and pay fixed incentive or award based fee these fee are determined by our ability to achieve target set in the contract such cost quality schedule and performance under time and material contract the customer pay fixed hourly rate for direct labor and generally reimburses for the cost of material each of these contract type present advantage and disadvantage typically we assume more risk with fixed price contract however these type of contract offer additional profit when we complete the work for le than originally estimated cost reimbursement contract generally subject to lower risk accordingly the associated base fee are usually lower than fee earned on fixed price contract under time and material contract our profit may vary if actual labor hour rate vary significantly from the negotiated rate also because these contract can provide little or no fee for managing material cost the content mix can impact profitability by customer wa follows year ended december combat system

liability on the consolidated balance sheet in our defense segment amount are billed work progress in accordance with agreed upon contractual term either at periodic interval biweekly or monthly or upon achievement of contractual milestone generally billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition resulting in contract asset however we sometimes receive advance or deposit from our customer particularly on our international contract before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liability these asset and liability are reported on the consolidated balance sheet on contract by contract basis at the end of each reporting period in our aerospace segment we generally receive deposit from customer upon contract execution and upon achievement of contractual milestone these deposit are liquidated when revenue is recognized change in the contract asset and liability balance during the year ended december were not materially impacted by any other factor except for the delay in on an international wheeled armored vehicle contract in our combat system segment which contributed to growth in contract asset further discussed in note revenue recognized in and that wa included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of each year wa billion billion and billion respectively this revenue represented primarily the sale of business jet aircraft earnings per sharewe compute basic earnings per share eps using net earnings for the period and the weighted average number of common share outstanding during the period basic weighted average share outstanding have decreased in and due to share repurchase see note for further discussion of our share repurchase diluted eps incorporates the additional share issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock option and the release of restricted stock and restricted stock unit rsus basic and diluted weighted average share outstanding were follows in thousand year ended december weighted average share effect of stock option and restricted stock rsus weighted average share excludes outstanding option to purchase share of common stock that had exercise price in excess of the average market price of our common stock during the

paid to transfer liability in the principal or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between marketplace participant various valuation approach can be used to determine fair value each requiring different valuation input the following hierarchy classifies the input used to determine fair value into three level level quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input other than quoted price observable by marketplace participant either directly or indirectly and level unobservable input significant to the fair value measurement we did not have any significant non financial asset or liability measured at fair value on december or our financial instrument include cash and equivalent account receivable and payable marketable security held in trust and other investment short and long term debt and derivative financial instrument the carrying value of cash and equivalent and account receivable and payable on the consolidated balance sheet

model that incorporate observable input such interest rate bond yield and quoted price for similar asset our level asset include direct private equity investment that are measured using input unobservable to marketplace participant income taxesincome tax provision we calculate our provision for federal state and international income tax based on current tax law federal tax reform wa enacted on december and ha several key provision impacting the accounting for and reporting of income tax the most significant provision reduced the corporate statutory tax rate from to beginning on january we recorded the effect of the change in tax law in the fourth quarter of the provision for income tax and effective tax rate in included unfavorable impact from the change in tax law the impact wa due primarily to the remeasurement of our federal deferred tax asset and liability at the tax rate expected to apply when the temporary difference are realized settled remeasured at rate of versus for the majority of our deferred tax asset and liability the treasury department and the internal revenue service irs are expected to issue further guidance related to tax reform that could impact our provision for income tax in future period result we believe it is reasonably possible there may be change to provisional interpretation and we made in our application of tax reform provision we do not expect the impact of any change to have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow the following is summary of our net provision for income tax for continuing operation year ended december federal for enacted change in tax law for income tax net income tax payment reported tax provision differs from the amount paid because some income and expense item are recognized in different time period for financial reporting than for income tax purpose state and local income tax allocable to government contract are included in operating cost and expense in the consolidated statement of earnings and therefore are not included in the provision above the reconciliation from the statutory federal income tax rate to our effective income tax rate follows

includes deferred tax asset of billion on december and billion on december related to the amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl to recognize the funded status of our retirement plan see note and for additional detail one of our deferred tax liability result from our participation in the capital construction fund ccf program established by the government and administered by the maritime administration that support the acquisition construction reconstruction or operation of flag merchant marine vessel the program allows to defer federal and state income tax on earnings derived from eligible program long the proceeds are deposited in the fund and withdrawal are used for qualified activity we had government account receivable pledged and thereby deposited to the ccf of and on december and respectively december we had net operating loss carryforwards of substantially all of which are associated with jurisdiction that have an indefinite carryforward period we had tax credit carryforwards of that began to expire in most of these carryforwards are subject to valuation allowance tax uncertainty we participate in the irs compliance assurance process cap real time audit of our consolidated federal corporate income tax return the irs ha examined our consolidated federal income tax return through and is currently reviewing our tax year for all period open to examination by tax authority we periodically ass our liability and contingency based on the latest available information where we believe there is more than chance that our tax position will not be sustained we record our best estimate of the resulting tax liability including interest in the consolidated financial statement we include any interest or penalty incurred in connection with income tax part of income tax expense based on all known fact and circumstance and current tax law we believe the total amount of any unrecognized tax benefit on december wa not material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow in addition there are no tax position for which it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefit will vary significantly over the next month producing individually or in the aggregate material effect on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow account receivableaccounts receivable represent amount billed and currently due

received progress payment in connection with the outstanding balance we expect to collect the full amount currently outstanding other than the balance related to the large international vehicle contract we expect to bill substantially all of the remaining year end net unbilled receivables balance during the amount not expected to be billed in result primarily from the agreed upon contractual

currency generally the respective local currency to at the end of period exchange rate and statement of earnings at the average exchange rate for each period the resulting foreign currency translation

purchased from supplier in electric boat wa made aware that it is defendant in lawsuit related to this matter which had been filed under seal in district court also in the suspending and debarring official for the department of the navy issued show cause letter to electric boat requesting that electric boat respond to the official concern regarding electric boat oversight and management with respect to it quality assurance system for subcontractor and supplier electric boat responded to the show cause letter and engaged in discussion with the government in the third quarter of the department of justice declined to intervene in the qui tam action noting that it investigation continues and the court unsealed the relator complaint in the first quarter of the relator filed an amended complaint given the current status of these matter we are unable to express view regarding the ultimate outcome or if the outcome is adverse to estimate an amount or range of reasonably possible loss depending on the outcome of these matter there could be material impact on our result of operation financial condition and cash flow additionally various other claim and legal proceeding incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against these other matter relate to such issue government investigation and claim the protection of the environment asbestos related claim and employee related matter the nature of litigation is such that we can not predict the outcome of these other matter however based on information currently available we believe any potential liability in these other proceeding individually or in the aggregate will not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow environmentalwe are subject to and affected by variety of federal state local and foreign environmental law and regulation we are directly or indirectly involved in environmental investigation or remediation at some of our current and former facility and third party site that we do not own but where we have been designated potentially responsible party prp by the environmental protection agency or state environmental agency based on historical experience we expect that significant percentage of the total remediation and compliance cost associated with these facility will continue to be allowable contract cost and therefore recoverable under government contract required we provide financial assurance for certain site undergoing or subject to investigation or remediation we accrue environmental cost when it is probable that liability ha been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated where applicable we seek insurance recovery for cost related to liability we do not record insurance recovery before collection is considered probable based on all known fact and analysis we do not believe that our liability at any individual site or in the aggregate arising from such environmental condition will be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow we also do not believe that the range of reasonably possible additional loss beyond what ha been recorded would be material to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow othergovernment contract government contractor we are subject to government audit and investigation relating to our operation including claim for fine penalty and compensatory and treble damage we believe the outcome of such ongoing government audit and investigation will not have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow in the performance of our contract we routinely request contract modification that require additional funding from the customer most often these request are due to customer directed change in the scope of work while we are entitled to recovery of these cost under our contract the administrative process with our customer may be protracted based on the circumstance we periodically file request for equitable adjustment reas that are sometimes converted into claim in some case these request are disputed by our customer we believe our outstanding modification reas and other claim will be resolved without material impact to our result of operation financial condition or cash flow letter of credit and guarantee in the ordinary course of business we have entered into letter of credit bank guarantee surety bond and other similar arrangement with financial institution and insurance carrier totaling approximately billion on december in addition from time to time and in the ordinary course of business we contractually guarantee the payment or performance of our subsidiary arising under certain contract aircraft trade in in connection with order for new aircraft in contract backlog our aerospace segment ha outstanding option with some customer to trade in aircraft partial consideration in their new aircraft transaction these trade in commitment are generally structured to establish the fair market value of the trade in aircraft at date generally or fewer day preceding delivery of the new aircraft to the customer at that time the customer is required to either exercise the option or allow it expiration other trade in commitment are structured to guarantee pre determined trade in value these commitment present more risk in the event of an adverse change in market condition in either case any excess of the pre established trade in price above the fair market value at the time the new aircraft is delivered is treated reduction of revenue in the new aircraft sale transaction of december the estimated change in fair market value from the date of the commitment wa not material labor agreement on december approximately one fifth of the employee of our subsidiary were working under collectively bargained term and condition including collective agreement that we have negotiated directly with union and work council number of these agreement expire within any given year historically we have been successful at renegotiating these labor agreement without any material disruption of operating activity in we expect to negotiate the term of agreement covering approximately employee we do not expect the renegotiations will either individually or in the aggregate have material impact on our result of operation financial condition or cash flow product warranty we provide warranty to our customer associated with certain product sale we record estimated warranty cost in the period in which the related product are delivered the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date is based generally on the number of month of warranty coverage remaining for the product delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payment warranty incurred in connection with long term production contract are accounted for within the contract estimate at completion our other warranty obligation primarily for business jet aircraft are

include the impact of the option in the lease term for purpose of determining total future lease payment most of our lease agreement do not explicitly state the discount rate implicit in the lease we use our incremental borrowing rate on the commencement date to calculate the present value of future payment our lease commonly include payment that are based on the consumer price index cpi or other similar index these variable lease payment are included in the calculation of the rou asset and lease liability other variable lease payment such usage based amount are excluded from the rou asset and lease liability and are expensed incurred in addition to the present value of the future lease payment the calculation of the rou asset also includes any deferred rent lease pre payment and initial direct cost of obtaining the lease such commission in addition to the base rent real estate lease typically contain provision for common area maintenance and other similar service which are considered non lease component for accounting purpose for our real estate lease we apply practical expedient to include these non lease component in calculating the rou asset and lease liability for all other

expected dividend we determine the above assumption based on the following expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over period equal to the expected term of the option expected term is based on assumption used by set of comparable peer company risk free interest rate is the yield on treasury zero coupon issue with remaining term equal to the expected term of

in most of these plan we match portion of the employee contribution our contribution to these plan totaled in in and in the defined contribution plan held approximately million share of our common stock representing approximately of our outstanding share on december and pension benefit we have twelve noncontributory and five contributory trusteed qualified defined benefit pension plan covering eligible government business employee and two noncontributory and four contributory plan covering eligible commercial business employee including some employee of our international operation the primary factor affecting the benefit earned by participant in our pension plan are employee year of service and compensation level our primary government pension plan which comprise the majority of our unfunded obligation were closed to new salaried participant on january additionally we made change to these plan for certain participant effective in that limit or cease the benefit that accrue for future service we made similar change to our primary pension plan in we made additional change to some of our pension plan effective in that further limit or cease the benefit that accrue for future service we also sponsor one funded and several unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plan which provide participant with additional benefit including excess benefit over limit imposed on qualified plan by federal tax law other post retirement benefit we maintain plan that provide post retirement healthcare and life insurance coverage for certain employee and retiree these benefit vary by employment status age service and salary level at retirement the coverage provided and the extent to which the retiree share in the cost of the program vary throughout the company the plan provide health and life insurance benefit only to those employee retire directly from our service and not to those who terminate service prior to eligibility for retirement contribution and benefit paymentsit is our policy to fund our defined benefit retirement plan in manner that optimizes the tax deductibility and contract recovery of contribution considered within our capital deployment framework therefore we may make discretionary contribution in addition to the required contribution determined in accordance with irs regulation we contributed to our pension plan in in our required contribution are approximately we maintain several tax advantaged account primarily voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust to fund the obligation for some of our other post retirement benefit plan for non funded plan claim are paid received contribution to our other post retirement benefit plan were not material in and are not expected to be material in we expect the following benefit to be paid from our retirement plan over the next year pensionbenefits other post contract considerationsour contractual arrangement with the government provide for the recovery of contribution to our pension and other post retirement benefit plan covering employee working in our defense segment for non funded plan our government contract allow to recover claim paid following payment these recoverable amount are allocated to contract and billed to the customer in accordance with the cost accounting standard ca and specific contractual term for some of these plan the cumulative pension and other post retirement benefit cost exceeds the amount currently allocable to contract to the extent we consider recovery of the cost to be probable based on our backlog and probable follow on contract we defer the excess in other contract cost in other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet until the cost is allocable to contract see note for discussion of our other contract cost for other plan the amount allocated to contract and included in revenue ha exceeded the plan cumulative benefit cost we have similarly deferred recognition of these excess earnings on the consolidated balance sheet benefit retirement plan summary financial informationestimating retirement plan asset liability and cost requires the extensive use of actuarial assumption these include the long term rate of return on plan asset the interest rate used to discount projected benefit payment healthcare cost trend rate and future salary increase given the long term nature of the assumption being made actual outcome can and often do differ from these estimate our annual benefit cost consists of four primary element the cost of benefit earned by employee for service rendered during the year an interest charge on our plan liability an assumed return on our plan asset for the year and other gain and loss which result from change in actuarial assumption difference between the actual and assumed long term rate of return on asset and change we make to plan benefit term these gain and loss are initially deferred in aocl and then amortized over future year component of our annual benefit cost we amortize actuarial difference under qualified plan on straight line basis over the average remaining service period of eligible employee if all or almost all of plan participant are inactive or are not accruing additional benefit we amortize these difference over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan participant we recognize the difference between the actual and expected return on plan asset for qualified plan over five year the deferral of these difference reduces the volatility of our annual benefit cost that can result either from year to year change in the assumption or from actual result that are not necessarily representative of the long term financial position of these plan we recognize difference under nonqualified plan immediately net annual

interest expected long term rate of return on we base the discount rate on current yield curve developed from portfolio of high quality fixed income investment with maturity consistent with the projected benefit payout period we use the spot rate approach to identify individual spot rate along the yield curve that correspond with the timing of each projected service cost and discounted benefit obligation payment we determine the long term rate of return on asset based on consideration of historical and forward looking return and the current and expected asset allocation strategy we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary government and commercial pension plan by basis point beginning in and we decreased the expected long term rate of return on asset in our primary other post retirement benefit plan by basis point beginning in both following an assessment of the historical and expected long term return of our various asset class retirement plan assumption are based on our best judgment including consideration of current and future market condition change in these estimate impact future pension and other post retirement benefit cost discussed above we defer recognition of the cumulative benefit cost for our government plan in of cost allocated to contract and included in revenue therefore the impact of annual change in financial
