model act and standard for formulary development that are often incorporated into government requirement many state regulate the scope of prescription drug coverage well the delivery channel to

subject to various industry economic regulatory and other risk and uncertainty our business financial condition result of operation cash flow and prospect could be materially adversely affected by any one or more of the following risk factor and by additional risk and uncertainty not presently known to or that we currently deem to be immaterial risk of declining gross margin in the pbm retail pharmacy and ltc pharmacy industry the pbm industry ha been experiencing margin pressure result of competitive pressure and increased client demand for lower price increased revenue sharing enhanced service offering and or higher service level in that regard we maintain contractual relationship with generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and brand name pharmaceutical manufacturer that provide for purchase discount and or rebate on drug dispensed by pharmacy in our retail network and by our specialty and mail order pharmacy all or portion of which may be passed on to client manufacturer rebate often depend on pbm ability to meet contractual market share or other requirement including in some case the placement of manufacturer product on the pbm formulary if we lose our relationship with one or more pharmaceutical manufacturer or if the discount or rebate provided by pharmaceutical manufacturer decline our business and financial result could be adversely affected further competitive pressure in the pbm industry have resulted in our client sharing in larger portion of rebate and or discount received from pharmaceutical manufacturer market dynamic and regulatory change have impacted our ability to offer plan sponsor pricing that includes the use of retail differential or spread which could negatively impact our future profitability further change in existing federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to patent term extension purchase discount and rebate arrangement with pharmaceutical manufacturer or to formulary management or other pbm service could also reduce the discount or rebate we receive in addition change in federal or state law or regulation or the adoption of new law or regulation relating to claim processing and billing including our ability to use mac list and collect transmission fee could adversely impact our profitability our retail pharmacy specialty pharmacy and ltc pharmacy operation have also been affected by the margin pressure described above including client demand for lower price generic pricing and network reimbursement pressure in addition competition increase in the market in which we operate significant increase in general pricing pressure could occur and this could require to reevaluate our pricing structure to remain competitive shift in the mix of our pharmacy prescription volume towards program offering lower reimbursement rate could adversely affect our margin including the shift in pharmacy mix towards day prescription at retail and the shift in pharmacy mix towards medicare part prescription the margin of our ltc business are further affected by the increased effort of health care payors to negotiate reduced or capitated pricing arrangement these action could also adversely affect the margin of our ltc business effort to reduce reimbursement level and alter health care financing practice the continued effort of health maintenance organization managed care organization pbms government entity and other third party payors to reduce prescription drug cost and pharmacy reimbursement rate well litigation and other legal proceeding relating to how drug are priced may impact our profitability in particular increased utilization of generic pharmaceutical which normally yield higher gross profit rate than equivalent brand named drug ha resulted in pressure to decrease reimbursement payment to retail specialty ltc and mail order pharmacy for generic drug causing reduction in the generic profit rate historically the effect of this trend on generic profitability ha been mitigated by our effort to negotiate reduced acquisition cost of generic pharmaceutical with manufacturer however in recent year there ha been significant consolidation within the generic manufacturing industry and it is possible that this and other external factor may enhance the ability of manufacturer to sustain or increase pricing of generic pharmaceutical and diminish our ability to negotiate reduced acquisition cost any inability to offset increased cost or to modify our activity to lessen the impact could have significant adverse effect on our result of operation in addition during the past several year the united state health care industry ha been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and audit at both the federal and state level effort to control health care cost including prescription drug cost are continuing at the federal and state government level changing political economic and regulatory influence may significantly affect health care financing and reimbursement practice for example we anticipate that federal and state government will continue to review and ass alternative health care delivery system payment methodology and operational requirement for health care provider including ltc facility and pharmacy change in the composition of pharmacy prescription volume toward program offering lower reimbursement rate could negatively impact our profitability any action taken to repeal or replace all or significant part of aca could also impact our profitability though it is unclear at this time what the full effect will be aca made several significant change to medicaid rebate and to reimbursement one of these change wa to revise the definition of the average manufacturer price pricing element common to most payment formula and the reimbursement formula for multi source generic drug this change ha negatively affected our reimbursement in addition aca made other change that affect the coverage and plan design that are or will be provided by many of our health plan client including the requirement for health insurer to meet minimum medical loss ratio to avoid having to pay rebate to enrollee these aca change may not affect our business directly but they could indirectly impact our service and or business practice highly competitive business environment each of our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy retail health clinic and pharmacy service operation currently operates in highly competitive and evolving health care environment the competitive success of our retail pharmacy business well our specialty pharmacy operation with non caremark payors is derived by their ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with pbms and other payors on acceptable term in an environment where some pbm client are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network pharmacy retail business we compete with other drugstore chain supermarket on line and other discount retailer independent pharmacy membership club convenience store and mass merchant some of which are aggressively expanding into market we serve we also face competition from other retail health clinic well other mail order pharmacy and pbms competition may also come from other source in the future change in market dynamic or the action of competitor or manufacturer including industry consolidation the emergence of new competitor and strategic alliance and the exclusion from new narrow or restricted network could materially and adversely impact we could also be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to change in market dynamic for example specialty pharmacy represents significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the united state significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacy because our specialty pharmacy operation focus on complex and high cost medication that serve relatively limited universe of patient the future growth of this business depends to significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drug and successfully penetrate key treatment category the competitive success of our ltc pharmacy operation is dependent upon our ability to compete in each geographic region where we have operation in the geographic region we serve we compete with pharmerica corporation our largest well with numerous local and regional institutional pharmacy pharmacy owned by ltc facility and local retail pharmacy the competitive success of our pharmacy service business is impacted by it ability to establish and maintain contractual relationship with network pharmacy in an environment where some pbm client are considering adopting narrow or restricted retail pharmacy network competitor in the pbm industry express script optumrx prime therapeutic medimpact and humana include large national pbm company pbms owned by large national health plan and smaller standalone pbms competition may also come from other source in the future in addition change in the overall composition of our pharmacy network or reduced pharmacy access under our network could adversely affect our claim volume and or our competitiveness generally competitor in each of our business area may offer service and pricing term that we may not be willing or able to offer strong competition in the pbm marketplace ha generated greater client demand for lower pricing increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offering unless we can demonstrate enhanced value to our client through innovative product and service offering particularly in rapidly changing health care industry we may be unable to remain competitive change in policy law and regulation including reform of the united state health care system the result of the november election have generated uncertainty with respect to and could result in significant change in legislation regulation and government policy that could significantly impact our business and the health care and retail industry while it is not possible to predict whether and when any such change will occur or what form any such change may take including through the use of executive order specific proposal discussed during and the election that could have material adverse effect on our business liquidity and result of operation include but are not limited to immigration policy the repeal of all or part of aca and other significant change to health care system legislation well change with respect to tax and trade policy tariff and other government regulation affecting trade between the united state and other country the repeal of all or part of the aca significant change to medicaid funding or even significant destabilization of the health insurance marketplace could impact the number of american with health insurance and consequently prescription drug coverage even if aca remains significant provision of aca have not yet been finalized nondiscrimination in health program and activity excise tax on high cost employer sponsored health coverage and it is uncertain whether or in what form these provision will be finalized we can not predict the effect if any repeal of all or part of aca the implementation or failure to implement the outstanding provision of aca or the enactment of new health care system legislation to replace current legislation may have on our retail pharmacy ltc pharmacy and pharmacy service operation in addition much of the branded and generic drug product that we sell in our retail mail and specialty pharmacy and much of the other merchandise we sell is manufactured in whole or in substantial part outside of the united state in most case the product or merchandise are imported by others and sold to result significant change in tax or trade policy tariff or trade relation between the united state and other country such the disallowance of tax deduction for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariff on imported product could result in significant increase in our cost restrict our access to supplier depress economic activity and have material impact on our business liquidity and result of operation in addition other country may change their business and trade policy and such change well any negative sentiment towards the united state in response to increased import tariff and other change in trade regulation could adversely affect our business finally comprehensive tax reform is likely to be considered in the current political environment we expect that tax reform if enacted could have significant impact on the company current proposal aim to lower the corporate tax rate from to low or but generally broaden the base to which the lower tax rate would apply many aspect of tax reform plan remain unknown though and no proposed legislation ha been filed we can not say with certainty if tax reform will be enacted or how it would impact the company risk related to compliance with broad and complex regulatory framework our business is subject to numerous federal state and local law and regulation see business government regulation in addition during the past several year the united state health care industry ha been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and enforcement activity at both the federal and state level further uncertainty exist regarding the application of many of these legal requirement to our business in addition it is possible that all or certain provision of the current health care reform legislation may be modified repealed or otherwise invalidated change in these law and regulation and the related interpretation and enforcement practice may require extensive system and operating change that may be difficult to untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable law and regulation could adversely affect the continued operation of our business including but not limited to imposition of civil or criminal penalty significant fine or monetary penalty suspension or disgorgement of payment from government program loss of required government certification or approval loss of authorization to participate in or exclusion from government reimbursement program such the medicare and medicaid program or loss of registration or licensure the regulation to which we are subject include but are not limited to the law and regulation described in the government regulation section accounting standard financial disclosure security law and regulation federal anti trust law tax law and regulation and

corporate integrity agreement corrective action plan and other agreement with government agency insurance licensing and other insurance regulatory requirement applicable to offering medicare part program and service or other health care service and direct regulation of pharmacy or pbms by regulatory and quasi regulatory body the possibility of client loss and or the failure to win new business our pbm business generates net revenue primarily by contracting with client to provide prescription drug and related health care service to plan member pbm client contract often have term of approximately three year in duration so approximately one third of pbm client base typically is subject to renewal each year in some case however pbm client may negotiate shorter or longer contract term or may require early or periodic renegotiation of pricing prior to expiration of contract our client are generally well informed and organized can easily move between our competitor and often seek competing bid prior to expiration of their contract in addition the reputational impact of service related incident could negatively affect our business these factor together with the impact of competitive pressure could make it difficult for to attract new client retain existing client and cross sell additional service further the pbm industry ha been affected by consolidation activity that may continue in the future in the event one or more of our pbm client is acquired by an entity that is not also our client we may be unable to retain all or portion of the acquired business these circumstance either individually or in the aggregate could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial result therefore we continually face challenge in competing for new pbm business and retaining or renewing our existing pbm business with respect to our ltc business reimbursement from skilled nursing facility for prescription we dispense is determined pursuant to our agreement with those skilled nursing facility the termination of these agreement generally cause our ability to provide service to any of the resident of that facility to cease resulting in the loss of revenue from any source for those resident there can be no assurance that we will be able to win new business or secure renewal business on term favorable to the present term additionally with respect to our retail and ltc pharmacy business reimbursement under medicare part well reimbursement from certain private third party payors is determined pursuant to agreement that we negotiate with those payors or their pharmacy benefit manager representative the loss of those agreement or material change in the term of those agreement could negatively impact the company in addition restricted network that exclude our retail or specialty pharmacy negatively impact those business risk related to the frequency and rate of the introduction and pricing of generic drug and brand name prescription product the profitability of our business is dependent upon the utilization of prescription drug product utilization trend are affected by among other factor the introduction of new and successful prescription pharmaceutical well lower priced generic alternative to existing brand name product the sale of generic alternative normally yield higher gross margin than brand name equivalent in addition inflation in the price of the brand name drug can affect utilization particularly given the increase in high deductible health plan accordingly our business could be impacted by slowdown or delay in the number or magnitude of new and successful prescription pharmaceutical and or generic alternative well the pricing of brand name drug the health of the economy in general and in the market we serve our business is affected by the economy and consumer confidence in general including various economic factor inflation and change in consumer purchasing power preference and or spending pattern it is possible that an unfavorable uncertain or volatile economic environment will cause decline in drug and health care service utilization and dampen demand for pharmacy benefit management service well consumer demand for product sold in our retail store further economic condition including interest rate fluctuation change in capital market condition and regulatory change may affect our ability to obtain necessary financing on acceptable term our ability to secure suitable store location under acceptable term and our ability to execute sale leaseback transaction under acceptable term these change in condition could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial result this could be further exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of high deductible health plan and health plan design favoring co insurance over co payment failure or disruption of our information technology system our information security system and our infrastructure to support our business and to protect the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information many aspect of our operation are dependent on our information system and the information collected processed stored and handled

expose to regulatory action and claim from customer and client financial institution payment card association and other person any of which could adversely affect our business financial position and result of operation because the technique used to obtain unauthorized access disable or degrade service or sabotage system change frequently and may not immediately produce sign of intrusion we may be unable to anticipate these technique or to implement adequate preventative measure moreover data security breach could require that we expend significant resource related to our information system and infrastructure and could distract management and other key personnel from performing their primary operational duty we also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the system of third party we interact with including key payors and vendor if our information system are damaged fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable or if we are unable to successfully complete our planned consolidation of our pbm claim adjudication platform we may incur substantial cost to repair or replace them and may experience reputational damage loss of critical information customer disruption and interruption or delay in our ability to perform essential function and implement new and innovative service in addition compliance with change in privacy and information security law and standard may result in considerable expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational process risk relating to the market availability supplier and safety profile of prescription drug that we purchase and sell we dispense significant volume of brand name and generic drug from our retail ltc specialty and mail order pharmacy and through our pbm network of retail pharmacy when increased safety risk profile or manufacturing or other supply issue of specific drug or class of drug occur or drug become subject to greater restriction controlled substance physician may cease writing prescription for these drug or the utilization of these drug may be otherwise reduced additionally adverse publicity regarding drug with higher safety risk profile may result in reduced consumer demand for such drug on occasion product are withdrawn by their manufacturer or transition to over the counter product which can result in lower prescription utilization in addition future fda ruling could restrict the supply or increase the cost of product sold to our customer our volume net revenue profitability and cash flow may decline result of such regulatory ruling or market change further we acquire substantial amount of our mail and specialty pharmacy prescription drug supply from limited number of supplier our agreement with these supplier are often short term and easily cancelable by either party without cause in addition these agreement may limit our ability to provide service for competing drug during the term of the agreement and may allow the supplier to distribute through channel other than certain of these agreement also allow pricing and other term to be adjusted periodically for changing market condition or required service level termination or modification to any of these relationship could have material adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation moreover many product distributed by our specialty pharmacy business are manufactured with ingredient that are susceptible to supply shortage disruption in our business operation could occur result of contamination of drug failure to maintain necessary shipment and storage condition error in mail order processing the unavailability of prescription drug provided by supplier labor disruption or other unanticipated disruption at our mail order facility call center data center or corporate facility among other factor such disruption could reduce our ability to process and dispense prescription and provide product and service to our customer the event any product we distribute are in limited supply for significant period of time our financial condition and result of operation could be materially and adversely affected regulatory and business change relating to our participation in medicare part medicare part ha resulted in increased utilization and put pressure on pharmacy gross margin rate due to regulatory and competitive pressure further result of aca and change to the retiree drug subsidy rule our pbm client could decide to discontinue providing prescription drug benefit to their medicare eligible member to the extent this occurs the adverse effect of increasing customer migration into medicare part may outweigh the benefit we realize from growth of our medicare part business in addition if the cost and complexity of medicare part exceed management expectation or prevent effective program implementation or administration if change to the regulation regarding how drug cost are reported for medicare part are implemented in manner that impact the profitability of our medicare part business if change to the regulation impact our ability to retain fee from third party including network pharmacy if the government alters medicare program requirement or reduces funding because of the higher than anticipated cost to taxpayer of medicare part or for other reason if congress act to reduce reinsurance threshold from to if we fail to design and maintain program that are attractive to medicare participant if cm imposes restriction on our medicare part business result of audit or other regulatory action if we fail to successfully implement corrective action or other remedial measure sufficient to prevent or remove any applicable restriction that may be imposed by cm or if we are not successful in retaining enrollee or winning contract renewal or new contract under medicare part competitive bidding process our medicare part service and the ability to expand our medicare part service could be negatively impacted possible change in industry pricing benchmark and drug pricing generally it is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulator may evaluate and or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price awp or wholesale acquisition cost wac which are the pricing reference used for many of our pbm and ltc client contract pharmaceutical purchase agreement retail network contract specialty payor agreement and other contract with third party payors in connection with the reimbursement of drug payment in addition many state medicaid fee for service program ffs medicaid are expected to establish pharmacy network payment on the basis of actual acquisition cost aac by april this move to an aac basis in ffs medicaid could have an impact in reimbursement practice in other commercial and government segment future change to the use of awp wac or to other published pricing benchmark used to establish pharmaceutical pricing including change in the basis for calculating reimbursement by federal and state health program and or other payors could impact the reimbursement we receive from medicare and medicaid program the reimbursement we receive from pbm client and other payors and or our ability to negotiate rebate and or discount with pharmaceutical manufacturer wholesaler pbms and retail pharmacy failure or inability to fully offset any increased price or cost or to modify our operation to mitigate the impact of such increase could have an adverse effect on our result of operation additionally any future change in drug price could be significantly different than our projection the effect of these possible change on our business can not be predicted at this time product liability product recall or personal injury issue could damage our reputation failure to maintain adequate liability insurance coverage the product that we sell could become subject to contamination product tampering mislabeling recall or other damage in addition error in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceutical could lead to serious injury or death product liability or personal injury claim may be asserted against with respect to any of the product or pharmaceutical we sell or service we provide our business involves the provision of professional service including by pharmacist nurse and nurse practitioner that expose to professional liability claim product or other liability issue arise the coverage limit under our insurance program and the indemnification amount available to may not be adequate to protect against claim we also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable term in the future damage to our reputation in the event of product liability or personal injury issue or judgment against or product recall could have significant adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation relationship with our retail and specialty pharmacy customer and the demand for our product and service including propriety brand the success of our business depends in part on customer loyalty superior customer service and our ability to persuade customer to frequent our retail store and online site and to purchase product in additional category and our proprietary brand failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer preference and spending pattern and evolving demographic mix in our market an inability to expand the product being purchased by our client and customer or the or inability to obtain or offer particular category of product could negatively affect our relationship with our client and customer and the demand for our product and service and could result in excess inventory of product we offer our retail customer proprietary brand product that are available exclusively at our retail store and through our online retail site the sale of proprietary product subject to unique risk including potential product liability risk and mandatory or voluntary product recall potential supply chain and distribution chain disruption for raw material and finished product our ability to successfully protect our intellectual property right and the right of applicable third party and other risk generally encountered by entity that source market and sell private label product any failure to adequately address some or all of these risk could have an adverse effect on our business result of operation and financial condition additionally an increase in the sale of our proprietary brand may negatively affect our sale of product owned by our supplier which consequently could adversely impact certain of our supplier relationship our ability to locate qualified economically stable supplier who satisfy our requirement and to acquire sufficient product in timely and effective manner is critical to ensuring among other thing that customer confidence is not diminished any failure to develop sourcing relationship with broad and deep supplier base could adversely affect our financial performance and erode customer loyalty moreover customer expectation and new technology advance from our competitor have required that our business evolve so that we are able to engage with our retail customer not only face to face in our store but also online and via mobile and social medium our customer are using computer tablet mobile phone and other electronic device to shop in our store and online well to provide public reaction concerning each facet of our operation if we fail to keep pace with dynamic customer expectation and new technology development our ability to compete and maintain customer loyalty could be adversely affected finally our specialty pharmacy business focus on complex and high cost medication many of which are made available by manufacturer to limited number of pharmacy so called limited distribution drug that serve relatively limited universe of patient result the future growth of our specialty pharmacy business is dependent largely upon expanding our base of drug or penetration in certain treatment category any contraction of our base of patient or reduction in demand for the prescription we currently dispense could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and result of operation we are subject to payment related risk that could increase our operating cost expose to fraud or theft subject to potential liability and disrupt our business operation we accept payment using variety of method including cash check credit card debit card gift card mobile payment and potentially other technology in the future acceptance of these payment method subject to rule regulation contractual obligation and compliance requirement including payment network rule and operating guideline data security standard and certification requirement and rule governing electronic fund transfer these requirement may change in the future which could make compliance more difficult or costly for certain payment option including credit and debit card we pay interchange and other fee which could increase periodically thereby raising our operating cost we rely on third party to provide payment processing service including the processing of credit card debit card and various other form of electronic payment if these company are unable to provide these service to or if their system are compromised our operation could be disrupted the payment method that we offer also expose to potential fraud and theft by person seeking to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weakness in the payment system if we fail to abide by applicable rule or requirement or if data relating to our payment system is compromised due to breach or misuse we may be responsible for any cost incurred by payment card issuing bank and other third party or subject to fine and higher transaction fee in addition our reputation and ability to accept certain type of payment could each be harmed resulting in reduced sale and adverse effect on our result of operation we may be unable to successfully integrate company acquired by upon the closing of any acquisition we complete we will need to successfully integrate the product service and related asset well internal control into our business operation if an acquisition is consummated the integration of the acquired business it product service and related asset into our company may also be complex and time consuming and if the integration is not fully successful we may not achieve the anticipated benefit operating and cost synergy or growth opportunity of an acquisition potential difficulty that may be encountered in the integration process include the following integrating personnel operation and system while maintaining focus on producing and delivering consistent high quality product and service coordinating geographically dispersed organization disruption of management attention from our ongoing business operation retaining existing customer and attracting new customer managing inefficiency associated with integrating our operation an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefit operating and cost synergy innovation and operation efficiency or growth opportunity of an acquisition well any delay encountered in the integration process could have material adverse effect on our business and result of operation furthermore these acquisition even if successfully integrated may fail to further our business strategy anticipated expose to increased competition or challenge with respect to our product service or geographic market and expose to additional liability associated with an acquired business including risk and liability associated with litigation involving the acquired business any one of these challenge or risk could impair our ability to realize any benefit from our acquisition after we have expended resource on them our outstanding debt and associated payment obligation could among other thing limit our ability to make incremental investment in our business our current debt service cost associated with our increased debt level may dampen incremental investment in our business and limit our flexibility to respond to industry change and market condition in addition our debt level and related debt service obligation could make it more difficult or expensive for to obtain any required future financing for working capital capital expenditure acquisition or other purpose moreover we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or otherwise access the capital market for any reason whether due to market condition or otherwise these circumstance could have material adverse effect on our business operation and financial condition risk related to the seasonality of our business although the majority of our revenue particularly pharmacy revenue are generally not seasonal in nature front store revenue tend to be higher during the december holiday season uncharacteristic or extreme weather condition can adversely impact consumer shopping pattern well this could lead to lost sale well increased snow removal and other cost thereby negatively affecting our short term result of operation in addition both pharmacy and front store revenue are affected by the timing and severity of the cough cold and
