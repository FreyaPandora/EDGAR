vendor political instability or labor unrest in source country retaliatory trade restriction imposed by either the united state or major source country tariff currency exchange rate and transport capacity and cost are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of product through our supply chain or increased their cost if we are unable to secure or develop and implement sufficiently robust new technology to deliver business process solution within the appropriate time frame cost and functionality our strategic initiative that are dependent upon these technology may not be successful the success of our strategic initiative designed to increase our sale and capture greater percentage of our customer expenditure on home improvement project is dependent in varying degree on the timely delivery and the functionality of information technology system to support them extended delay or cost overrun in securing developing and otherwise implementing technology solution to support the new business initiative we are developing now and will be developing in the future would delay and possibly even prevent from realizing the projected benefit of those initiative we may not be able to achieve the objective of the strategic initiative we have underway if our organization is unable to make the transformational change we are undertaking in our business model we are adapting our business model to meet our customer changing expectation that we will not only sell them the product and service they need and want but also deliver using new tool skill and process full service experience by being part of their home improvement project from start to finish our strategy require transformational change to our business model and will require new competency in some position and our employee and independent contractor such third party installers and repair technician will not only have to understand non traditional selling platform but also commit to fundamental change in lowe culture and the process through which they have traditionally interacted with customer to the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational change our strategic initiative designed to increase our sale and capture greater percentage of our customer expenditure on home improvement project may not be successful we expect them to be the many challenge our management face in effectively managing our business we adapt our business model also increase the risk that we may not achieve our objective our financial performance could suffer if we fail to properly maintain our critical information system or if those system are seriously disrupted an important part of our effort to achieve efficiency cost reduction and sale and cash flow growth is the maintenance and ongoing improvement of our existing management information system that support operation such inventory replenishment merchandise ordering

nonetheless occur and have material adverse effect on our reputation and lead to financial loss from remedial action loss of business or potential liability including for possible punitive damage an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of sensitive data from our information system could also materially increase the cost we already incur to protect against such risk in addition the regulatory environment relating to retailer and other company obligation to protect such sensitive data becomes stricter material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulation could subject to fine or other regulatory sanction and potentially to lawsuit if we fail to hire train manage and retain qualified sale associate and specialist or contract with qualified installers and repair technician with expanded skill set who can work effectively and collaboratively in an increasingly culturally diverse environment we could lose sale to our competitor our customer whether they are homeowner or commercial business expect our sale associate and specialist to be well trained and knowledgeable about the product we sell and the home improvement service we provide our customer also expect the independent contractor who install product they purchase from to perform the installation in timely and capable manner increasingly our sale associate and specialist must have expanded skill set including in some instance the ability to do in home or telephone sale in addition in many of our store our employee and third party contractor must be able to serve customer whose primary language and cultural tradition are different from their own also our employee become increasingly culturally diverse our manager and sale associate must be able to manage and work

the product we sell we also rely upon many independent service provider for technology solution and other service that are important to many aspect of our business if these vendor table of content or service provider fail or are unable to perform expected and we are unable to replace them quickly our business could be adversely affected at least temporarily we are able to do and potentially in

financial condition product and service quality issue could result in negative impact on customer confidence in lowe and the company brand image result lowe reputation retailer of high quality product

lowe business outlook financial condition liquidity and capital resource off balance sheet arrangement contractual obligation and commercial commitment critical accounting policy and estimate executive overview during we made progress on our key initiative continuing our journey to become the customer first choice in home improvement the economic environment showed sign of improvement fiscal represented the first year of growth across all of the core housing metric housing turnover single family start and median home price these recent positive trend helped consumer regain confidence in both the local housing market and their home value consequently we were able to deliver solid result for the year net earnings for increased to billion and diluted earnings per share increased to net sale for increased to billion fiscal contained an extra week which contributed million to net sale or to diluted earnings per share comparable sale were driven by increase in comparable average ticket and increase in comparable transaction for cash flow from operating activity were approximately billion with billion used for capital expenditure our strong financial position and positive cash flow provided with the ability to make strategic investment in our core business and to return cash to shareholder through both dividend and share repurchase during fiscal we paid million in dividend and repurchased approximately million share of common stock for total of billion under our share repurchase program continuing our journey in we continued to deliver on our commitment to retail excellence by building on our core strength while developing capability to provide seamless support across channel and simplified home improvement experience to further deliver seamless and simple experience we continued to upgrade our it infrastructure and gave customer and associate greater access to information and product through enhanced mobile technology mylowes and flexible fulfillment in we made additional improvement to our associate iphone capability to enable them to deliver better customer experience in the aisle by giving them immediate access to the information they need such the ability to identify available rebate our mylowes customer base also continues to grow since the launch of mylowes in late there have been over million unique key fob swipe and over million cardholder have registered their card on mylowes we also experienced strong customer response to our iphone and androidtm mobile application which have grown to represent approximately of overall lowes com traffic in addition flexible fulfillment now allows to deliver in stock lowes com parcel order to customer in over of market within hour at standard shipping rate we redefine our business to become more seamless and simple we must also continue to protect retail relevance in our focus wa on two key initiative value improvement and product differentiation value improvement is designed to enhance our ability to offer compelling product and value while product differentiation is designed to help drive excitement and flexibility in our store by highlighting innovative product through better display technique these strategic initiative build on lowe core strength and are expected to deliver comparable transaction growth better gross margin and greater inventory productivity by localizing assortment and driving excitement in our store value improvement enhances our ability to offer compelling product and value by the right product at the right quantity at the right place at the right time in we leveraged our integrated planning and execution tool to create cluster of store based on specific difference and customer buying preference which enhanced the assortment strategy that wa used to guide the line review process for each cluster the product assortment were designed to reduce duplication of feature and function within price point to improve the customer experience we are also working to reduce unit cost by negotiating lower first cost from vendor by eliminating fund set aside for promotional and marketing support the result is more localized assortment of product and simpler price point progression within the category skus are rationalized the team are reinvesting the inventory dollar in greater depth of high volume skus in addition we are increasing our in stock target for these new line to ensure item are available when needed by customer by the end of we completed product line review and product line reset of approximately and of our business respectively through our product differentiation initiative we revised many of our end cap location to highlight innovative product significant value or to showcase specific private or national brand in addition we redesigned promotional space to better promote seasonally relevant high value item to drive sale and to provide more open sight line to navigate and shop at our store during our product differentiation reset were rolled out to approximately store and we expect to roll the reset out to an additional store in in conjunction with our progress on value improvement and product differentiation in we also initiated sale training program for store and contact center employee to further develop our sale culture and pave the way for the next phase of our transformation where we go from and beyond while the housing market is slowly improving consumer are still coping with the lingering effect of the recession mortgage delinquency rate remain at historic high while we are optimistic about housing recovery and near term personal consumption expenditure are expected to grow faster than personal income employment and income are expected to continue to grow slowly consumer will need to continue to prioritize how and where they spend their discretionary income and therefore our outlook for assumes modest growth in the home improvement market however we have confidence in our vision and have laid the foundation to continue improving our core business we move into fiscal year in our value improvement initiative will remain the primary focus of the organization we improve our product offering by localizing assortment we expect to drive improved close rate we also have an opportunity to improve close rate through additional labor in our store we expect to add approximately hour per store per week to the staffing model for nearly two third of our store to help reduce the gap our weekend versus weekday close rate our goal is to better serve customer and close more sale during peak weekday hour by increasing assistance available in the aisle we believe the increased labor hour and higher in stock service level will help further capitalize on traffic during the week which will result in an improvement in close rate in and beyond we will further develop our flexible fulfillment capability by deploying central dispatch cdo and central production office cpo the cdo will allow for centralized delivery scheduling and better route planning resulting in lower fuel cost greater fleet utilization and more productive overall delivery the cpo will provide operational efficiency through the consolidation of labor today each store ha it own installed sale office whereas in the future that labor will be consolidated into our contact center resulting in significant reduction of labor hour the customer experience will be enhanced through better coordination and consistency we will also build trust by partnering with customer to recommend solution that fit their need and to help them make the right decision based on their individual home improvement goal beyond we will further enhance our sale culture by providing our associate the ability to sell seamlessly across channel and to introduce improved project management tool that expand fulfillment capability to cultivate personal and simple connection with customer associate across selling channel will be provided with single view of the customer one record per customer from lead capture to project completion these change will enable to improve close rate and capitalize on the momentum of the improving economy and increase in consumer discretionary spending by building on core strength we have laid the foundation to deliver on our commitment to retail excellence and will continue to focus on developing the capability to provide our customer seamless and simple home improvement experience going forward operation the following table set forth the percentage relationship to net sale of each line item of the consolidated statement of earnings well the percentage change in dollar amount from the prior year this table should be read in

divided by average total asset for the last five quarter return on average shareholder equity is defined net earnings divided by average shareholder equity for the last five quarter return on invested capital is non gaap financial measure see below for additional information return on invested capital return on invested capital roic is considered non gaap financial measure we believe roic is meaningful metric for investor because it measure how effectively the company us capital to generate profit we define roic trailing four quarter net operating profit after tax divided by the average of ending debt and equity for the last five quarter although roic is common financial metric numerous method exist for calculating roic accordingly the method used by our management to calculate roic may differ from the method other company use to calculate their roic we encourage to understand the method used by another company to calculate it roic before comparing it roic to we consider return on average debt and equity to be the financial measure computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principle that is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to roic the difference between these two measure is that roic adjusts net earnings to exclude tax adjusted interest expense the calculation of roic together with reconciliation to the calculation of return on average debt and equity the most comparable gaap financial measure is follows in million except percentage data calculation of return on invested capital numerator net earnings plus interest expense net provision for income tax earnings before interest and tax le income tax adjustment net operating profit after tax effective tax rate denominator average debt and equity return on invested capital calculation of return on average debt and equity numerator net earnings denominator average debt and equity return on average debt and equity income tax adjustment is defined earnings before interest

compared to fiscal for the purpose of the following discussion comparable sale comparable average ticket and comparable customer transaction are based on comparable week period net sale net sale increased to billion in the additional week in and resulting week shift in negatively impacted sale comparison by million or comparable sale increased in driven by increase in comparable average ticket and increase in comparable customer transaction our key initiative value improvement and product differentiation drove basis point of the increase in sale in addition our proprietary credit value proposition which offer customer the choice of off every day or promotional financing contributed basis point to the increase in sale geographically all operating division in the delivered positive comparable sale for the year sale performance wa well balanced in furthermore we continued to see strength in our pro service business which outperformed the company average we experienced comparable sale above the company average in the following product category during lumber tool outdoor power equipment paint seasonal living cabinet countertop and home fashion storage cleaning in addition fashion electrical hardware flooring and plumbing performed at approximately the overall company average inflation aided comparable sale throughout the year in both the lumber and paint category comparable sale for paint also benefited from new product offering hurricane sandy also contributed to comparable sale increase for lumber result of storm response effort and for tool outdoor power equipment due to increased generator sale in addition tool outdoor power equipment comparable sale were also positively impacted by favorable weather in the first half of the year combined with effective promotion comparable sale were below the company average in building material millwork appliance and lawn garden the timing of storm recovery and repair effort in compared to resulted in decreased comparable sale in building material in addition difficult comparison to prior year promotional activity led to decreased comparable sale in millwork and appliance lawn garden wa impacted by extreme heat and drought condition in the first half of the year slightly offset by improved inventory planning and attachment rate in the second half of the year gross margin gross margin of for represented basis point decrease from primarily driven by an unfavorable basis point impact related to our proprietary credit value proposition in addition we experienced seven basis point unfavorable impact to margin related to pricing and promotional activity sg the basis point decrease in sg expense percentage of sale from to wa primarily driven by basis point of leverage due to long lived asset impairment and other cost associated with the store closure and discontinued project in we also experienced approximately basis point of leverage associated with our proprietary credit program which wa driven by increased portfolio income result of continued growth in the program these were partially offset by deleverage of approximately basis point associated with incentive compensation due to higher attainment level compared to target for store based employee relative to last year in addition we experienced nine basis point of deleverage in contract labor associated with information technology project to improve customer experience depreciation depreciation expense deleveraged six basis point for compared to primarily due to higher depreciation associated with it capital investment made to improve customer experience which have shorter average useful life property le accumulated depreciation decreased to billion at february compared to billion at february at february and february we owned of our store which included store on leased land interest net net interest expense is comprised of the following in million interest expense net of amount capitalized amortization of original issue discount and loan cost interest income interest net net interest expense increased primarily result of the issuance of billion and billion of unsecured note in november and april respectively partially offset by favorable tax settlement that resulted in reduced interest accrual during income tax provision our effective income tax rate wa in compared to in the lower effective tax rate in wa the result of the recognition of one time federal employee retention benefit from the federal hire hiring incentive to restore employment retention tax credit well the favorable settlement of certain state tax matter in the third quarter of fiscal compared to fiscal for the purpose of the following discussion comparable sale comparable average ticket and comparable customer transaction are based on comparable week period net sale net sale increased to billion in while comparable sale were flat the additional week in contributed to the increase in net sale comparable customer transaction increased approximately and comparable average ticket decreased versus while comparable sale were flat in we saw sequential improvement each quarter with comparable sale of negative in the first quarter negative in the second quarter positive in the third quarter and positive in the fourth quarter unseasonably cold wet weather severe storm and flooding during the first quarter well comparison to the cash for appliance government incentive program led to lower performance during the first half of the year however comparison to the cash for appliance program eased and storm recovery effort were underway we saw improvement in comparable sale in addition strong customer response to our off every day offer to lowe credit cardholder launched in the first half of aided comparable sale for the balance of the year we experienced comparable sale above the company average in the following product category during building material fashion electrical paint hardware plumbing and tool outdoor power equipment in addition seasonal living home fashion storage cleaning flooring lawn garden and lumber performed at approximately the overall company average although unfavorable weather in the early part of the year negatively impacted outdoor category such building material recovery effort after severe spring storm that hit many region of the country and hurricane irene positively impacted comparable sale in building material with particularly strong sale of roofing product and installation service plumbing also benefited from the wet weather and storm recovery effort with strong sale of pump tank and dehumidifiers in addition tool outdoor power equipment experienced favorable comparable sale primarily driven by holiday promotion and strong customer response to new product such our new line of kobalt mechanic tool fashion electrical also performed above the company average during driven by increased customer demand for energy saving light bulb outdoor lighting and electrical cable however difficult comparison to prior year energy tax credit negatively impacted comparable sale in millwork in addition while we experienced strong market share gain in cabinet countertop they were not enough to offset the impact of the contracting market leading to comparable sale below the company average for the year appliance also experienced negative comparable sale for the year driven by comparison to the prior year cash for appliance program which primarily impacted the first half of the year gross margin gross margin of for represented basis point decrease from primarily driven by margin rate strong customer response to our off every day offer to lowe credit cardholder targeted promotional activity and pricing change associated with our move to every day low price negatively impacted margin for the year margin wa also negatively impacted by basis point associated with distribution expense primarily related to higher fuel cost in addition lower of cost or market inventory adjustment primarily related to the store that closed in the second half of the year negatively impacted margin by six basis point these were partially offset by basis point of favorable impact associated with the mix of product sold across product category sg the increase in sg expense percentage of sale from to wa primarily driven by de leverage of basis point related to charge for store closing discontinued project and long lived asset impairment we also experienced approximately basis point of de leverage related to investment made to improve customer experience including expense associated with additional internal and external staffing and technology expenditure in addition we experienced de leverage in payroll tax and fleet expense these increase were partially offset by leverage of approximately basis point associated with our proprietary credit program due to reduced program cost associated with lower loss and lower promotional financing more customer took advantage of the off every day offer in addition bonus expense leveraged basis point due to lower attainment level for the year relative to plan depreciation depreciation expense leveraged basis point for compared to primarily due to lower asset base resulting from decreased capital spending and asset becoming fully depreciated or impaired property le accumulated depreciation decreased to billion at february compared to billion at january at february and january we owned of our store which included store on leased land interest net interest expense is comprised of the following in million interest expense net of amount capitalized amortization of original issue discount and loan cost interest income interest net net interest expense increased primarily result of the issuance of billion of note during and billion of note during offset by the repayment of million of note during income tax provision our effective income tax rate wa in compared to in the reduction in the effective tax rate wa predominantly due to the recognition of benefit from the federal hire hiring incentive to restore employment retention tax credit well various state tax credit program lowe business outlook of february the date of our fourth quarter earnings release we expected total sale in to increase approximately and comparable sale to increase approximately we expected to open approximately store during in addition earnings before interest and tax percentage of sale operating margin were expected to increase approximately basis point and the effective tax rate wa expected to be approximately diluted earnings per share of were expected for the fiscal year ending january our guidance assumed approximately billion in share repurchase during spread evenly across the four quarter financial condition liquidity and capital resource cash flow cash flow from operating activity continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity the decrease in net cash provided by operating activity for versus wa primarily driven by change in working capital the change in working capital wa primarily driven by the timing of tax payment during the period the decrease in net cash used in investing activity for versus wa primarily driven by decrease in capital expenditure in addition to an increase in proceeds received from the sale of property and other long term asset partially offset by lower proceeds from the sale maturity of investment the increase in net cash used in financing activity for wa primarily driven by an increase in cash used to repurchase share which included share repurchased under our share repurchase program and share withheld from employee to satisfy statutory tax withholding liability upon vesting of restricted stock award this wa partially offset by the net change in long term debt and an increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock due to option exercised source of liquidity in addition to our cash flow from operation liquidity is provided by our short term borrowing facility we have billion senior credit facility that expires in october the senior credit facility support our commercial paper program and ha million letter of credit sublimit letter of credit issued pursuant to the senior credit facility reduce the amount available for borrowing under it term borrowing made are unsecured and are priced at fixed rate based upon market condition at the time of funding in accordance with the term of the senior credit facility the senior credit facility contains certain restrictive covenant which include maintenance of debt leverage ratio defined by the senior credit facility we were in compliance with those covenant at february thirteen banking institution are participating in the senior credit facility there were no outstanding borrowing or letter of credit under the senior credit facility and no outstanding borrowing under our commercial paper program at february we expect to continue to have access to the capital market on both short term and long term base when needed for liquidity purpose by issuing commercial paper or new long term debt the availability and the borrowing cost of these fund could be adversely affected however by downgrade of our debt rating or deterioration of certain financial ratio the table below reflects our debt rating by standard poor and moody of april which we are disclosing to enhance understanding of our source of liquidity and the effect of our rating on our cost of fund although we currently do not expect downgrade in our debt rating our commercial paper and senior debt rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating debt rating moody commercial paper senior debt outlook negative stable we believe that net cash provided by operating and financing activity will be adequate not only for our operating requirement but also for investment in information technology investment in our existing store expansion plan and acquisition if any and to return cash to shareholder through both dividend and share repurchase over the next month there are no provision in any agreement that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or lease result of downgrade in our debt rating or decrease in our stock price in addition we do not have significant amount of cash held in foreign affiliate that would not be available to fund domestic operation cash requirement capital expenditure our fiscal capital budget is approximately billion inclusive of approximately million of lease commitment resulting in planned net cash outflow of billion approximately of the planned net cash outflow is for investment to enhance the customer experience including enhancement in information technology investment in our existing store are expected to account for approximately of net cash outflow including investment in store equipment reset and remerchandising our expansion plan for consist of approximately new store all of which are expected to be owned and which will account for approximately of the planned net cash outflow approximately of these new store are expected to be on leased land other planned capital expenditure accounting for of planned net cash outflow are for investment in our distribution network including one additional regional distribution center debt and capital in april we issued billion of unsecured note in three tranche million of note maturing in april million of note maturing in april and million of note maturing in april net proceeds from the and note were approximately million million and million respectively during million of unsecured debt matured and wa re paid with cash from operation and investing activity dividend declared during fiscal totaled million our dividend payment date are established such that dividend are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of wa paid in fiscal and totaled million we have an ongoing share repurchase program that is executed through purchase made from time to time in the open market or through private off market transaction share purchased under the share repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status on february the company board of director authorized an additional billion of share repurchase with no expiration simultaneously terminating the remaining previous balance of million under the prior authorization this share repurchase authorization is expected to be used by the end of fiscal our ratio of debt to equity plus debt wa and of february and february respectively off balance sheet arrangement other than in connection with executing operating lease we do not have any off balance sheet financing that ha or is reasonably likely to have material current or future effect on our financial condition cash flow result of operation liquidity capital expenditure or capital resource contractual obligation and commercial commitment the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligation at february payment due by period contractual obligation le than after in million total year year year year long term debt principal amount excluding discount long term debt interest payment capitalized lease obligation operating lease purchase obligation total contractual obligation amount of commitment expiration by period commercial commitment le than after in million total year year year year letter of credit amount do not include tax common area maintenance insurance or contingent rent because these amount have historically been insignificant represents commitment related to certain marketing and information technology program and purchase of merchandise inventory letter of credit are issued primarily for insurance and construction contract at february our reserve for uncertain tax position including penalty and interest wa million of which million wa classified current liability and million wa classified noncurrent liability at this time we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payment in individual year beyond month due to uncertainty in the timing of the effective settlement of tax position critical accounting policy and estimate the preparation of the consolidated financial statement and note to consolidated financial statement presented in this form requires to make estimate that affect the reported amount of asset liability sale and expense and related disclosure of contingent asset and liability we base these estimate on historical result and various other assumption believed to be reasonable all of which form the basis for making estimate concerning the carrying value of asset and liability that are not readily available from other source actual result may differ from these estimate our significant accounting policy are described in note to the consolidated financial statement we believe that the following accounting policy affect the most significant estimate and management judgment used in preparing the consolidated financial statement merchandise inventory description we record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventory below cost this reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory level sale trend and historical experience during our reserve increased approximately million to million of february we also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventory this reserve is based primarily on actual shrinkage result from previous physical inventory during the inventory shrinkage reserve increased approximately million to million of february in addition we receive fund from vendor in the normal course of business principally result of purchase volume sale early payment or promotion of vendor product generally these vendor fund do not represent the reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost that we incurred to sell the vendor product therefore we treat these fund reduction in the cost of inventory the amount are accrued and recognize these fund reduction of cost of sale when the inventory is sold fund that are determined to be reimbursement of specific incremental and identifiable cost incurred to sell vendor product are recorded an offset to the related expense judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimate we do not believe that our merchandise inventory are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practice based on anticipated sale trend and general economic condition however change in consumer purchasing pattern or deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserve likewise change in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary based on the timing and result of physical inventory we also apply judgment in the determination of level of non productive inventory and assumption about net realizable value for vendor fund we develop accrual rate based on the provision of the agreement in place due to the complexity and diversity of the individual vendor agreement we perform analysis and review historical purchase trend and volume throughout the year adjust accrual rate appropriate and confirm actual amount with select vendor to ensure the amount earned are appropriately recorded amount accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volume differ from projected purchase volume especially in the case of program that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volume are met effect if actual result differ from assumption we have not made any material change in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserve for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal year we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate for both of these inventory reserve however it is possible that actual result could differ from recorded reserve change in either the amount of product considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrinkage reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately million for we have not made any material change in the methodology used to recognize vendor fund during the past three fiscal year if actual result are not consistent with the assumption and estimate used we could be exposed to additional adjustment that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory however substantially all receivables associated with these activity do not require subjective long term estimate because they are collected within the following fiscal year adjustment to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material long lived asset impairment description we review the carrying amount of location whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable when evaluating location for impairment our asset group is at an individual location level that is the lowest level for which cash flow are identifiable cash flow for individual location do not include an allocation of corporate overhead we evaluate location for triggering event relating to long lived asset impairment on quarterly basis to determine when location asset carrying value may not be recoverable for operating location our primary indicator that asset carrying value may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for month period for those location that have been open in the same location for sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating result management also monitor other factor when evaluating operating location for impairment including individual location execution of their operating plan and local market condition including incursion which is the opening of either other lowe location or those of direct competitor within the same market we also consider there to be triggering event when there is current expectation that it is more likely than not that given location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life potential impairment ha occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location asset are le than the carrying amount of the asset when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management make assumption incorporating local market condition about key store variable including sale growth rate gross margin and controllable expense such store payroll and occupancy expense well asset residual value or lease rate an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value we use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating location which requires discounting projected future cash flow this involves making assumption regarding both location future cash flow described above and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flow we discount our cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow the selected market participant represent group of other retailer with market footprint similar in size to ours we use market approach to determine the fair value of our individual location identified for closure this involves making assumption regarding the estimated selling price or estimated lease rate by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated the information includes comparable sale of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these asset judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimate our impairment evaluation require to apply judgment in determining whether triggering event ha occurred including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it previously estimated useful life our impairment loss calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow including estimated sale margin and controllable expense and assumption about market performance for operating location and estimated selling price or lease rate for location identified for closure we also apply judgment in estimating asset fair value including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair value determined using an income approach effect if actual result differ from assumption during operating location experienced triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability five of the operating location were determined to be impaired we recorded impairment loss related to these five operating location of million during compared to impairment loss on operating location and location identified for closure of million during we have not made any material change in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flow of operating location or location identified for closure during the past three fiscal year if the actual result are not consistent with the assumption and judgment we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that location will be closed significantly before the end of it useful life or in estimating future cash flow and determining asset fair value our actual impairment loss could vary positively or negatively from our estimated impairment loss seven of the operating location that experienced triggering event during were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for these seven location the expected undiscounted cash flow substantially exceeded the net book value of the location asset reduction in projected sale used to estimate future cash flow at the latest date that these seven operating location were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of four of these location and increased recognized impairment loss by approximately million we analyzed other assumption made in estimating the future cash flow of the operating location evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumption wa not significant to the estimate store closing lease obligation description when location under operating lease are closed we recognize liability for the fair value of future contractual obligation associated with the leased location the fair value of the store closing lease obligation is determined using an expected present value cash flow model incorporating future minimum lease payment property tax utility common area maintenance and other ongoing expense net of estimated sublease income and other recoverable item discounted at credit adjusted risk free rate the expected present value cash flow model us probability weighted scenario approach that assigns varying cash flow to certain scenario based on the expected likelihood of outcome estimating the fair value involves making assumption regarding estimated sublease income by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated the information includes comparable lease rate of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for leasing these asset subsequent change to the liability including change resulting from revision to either the timing or the amount of estimated cash flow are recognized in the period of the change judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimate our store closing lease liability calculation require to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flow primarily related to estimated sublease income and the selection of an appropriate discount

contract term primarily range from one to four year from the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer warranty applicable the company consistently group and evaluates extended protection plan contract based on the characteristic of the underlying product and the coverage provided in order to monitor for expected loss loss on the overall contract would be recognized if the expected cost of

protection plan contract increased million to million of february we defer revenue and cost of sale associated with settled transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed revenue is deferred based on the actual amount received we use historical gross margin rate to estimate the adjustment to cost of sale for these transaction during deferred revenue associated with these transaction increased million to million of february judgment and uncertainty involved in the estimate for extended protection plan there is judgment inherent in our evaluation of expected loss result of our methodology for grouping and evaluating extended protection plan contract and from the actuarial determination of the estimated cost of the contract there is also judgment inherent in our determination of the recognition pattern of cost of performing service under these contract for the deferral of revenue and cost of sale associated with transaction for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed there is judgment inherent in our estimate of gross

three fiscal year we currently do not anticipate incurring any overall contract loss on our extended protection plan contract although we believe that we have the ability to adequately monitor and estimate expected loss under the extended protection plan contract it is possible that actual result could differ from our estimate in addition if future evidence indicates that the cost of performing service under these contract are incurred on other than straight line basis the timing of revenue recognition under these contract could change change in the amount of revenue recognized in under these contract would have affected net earnings by approximately million we have not made any material change in the methodology used to reverse net sale and cost of sale related to amount received for which customer have not yet taken possession of merchandise or for which installation ha not yet been completed we believe we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimate related to the impact to cost of sale for these transaction however if actual result are not consistent with our estimate or assumption we may incur additional income or expense change in the

measurement date the authoritative guidance for fair value measurement establishes three level hierarchy which encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable input and minimize the use of unobservable input when measuring fair value the three level of the hierarchy are defined follows level input to the valuation technique that are quoted price in active market for identical asset or liability level input to the valuation technique that are other than quoted price but are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level input to the valuation technique that are unobservable for the asset or liability asset and liability that are measured at fair value on recurring basis the following table present the company financial asset measured at fair value

benchmark yield reported trade broker dealer quote issuer spread and benchmark security among others asset and liability that are measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis for the year ended february and february the company only significant asset or liability measured at fair value on nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition were certain asset subject to long lived asset impairment the company review the carrying amount of long lived asset whenever certain event or change in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable with input from retail store operation the company accounting and finance personnel that organizationally report to the chief financial officer ass the performance of retail store quarterly against historical pattern and projection of future profitability for evidence of possible impairment an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the asset disposal group is not recoverable and exceeds it fair value the company estimated the fair value of asset subject to long lived asset impairment based on the company own judgment about the assumption that market participant would use in pricing the asset and on observable market data when available the company classified these fair value measurement level in the determination of impairment for operating location the company determined the fair value of individual operating location using an income approach which required discounting projected future cash flow when determining the stream of projected future cash flow associated with an individual operating location management made assumption incorporating local market condition and input from retail store operation about key variable including the following unobservable input sale growth rate gross margin controllable expense such payroll and occupancy expense and asset residual value in order to calculate the present value of those future cash flow the company discounted cash flow estimate at rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participant would assign to the cash flow in general the selected market participant represented group of other retailer with location footprint similar in size to the company during operating location experienced triggering event and were evaluated for recoverability five of the operating location were determined to be impaired due to decline in recent cash flow trend and an unfavorable sale outlook resulting in an impairment loss of million the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of the impaired operating location assumed average annual sale growth rate ranging from to over the remaining life of the location and applied discount rate of approximately the remaining seven operating location that experienced triggering event during were determined to be recoverable and therefore were not impaired for these seven location the expected undiscounted cash flow substantially exceeded the net book value of the location asset reduction in projected sale used to estimate future cash flow at the latest date these seven operating location were evaluated for impairment would have resulted in the impairment of four of these location and increased recognized impairment loss by million we analyzed other assumption made in estimating the future cash flow of the operating location evaluated for impairment but the sensitivity of those assumption wa not significant to the estimate in the determination of impairment for location identified for closure and for excess property held for use and held for sale which consisted of retail outparcels and property associated with relocated or closed location the fair value were determined using market approach based on estimated selling price the company determined the estimated selling price by obtaining information from property broker or appraiser in the specific market being evaluated or negotiated non binding offer to purchase the information obtained from property broker or appraiser included comparable sale of similar asset and assumption about demand in the market for these asset during the company incurred total impairment charge of million for excess property location reduction in the estimated selling price for these excess property at the date the location were evaluated for impairment would have increased impairment loss by approximately million the following table present the company non financial asset measured at estimated fair value on nonrecurring basis and the resulting long lived asset impairment loss
