pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraint discount restriction on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measure and in some case mechanism to encourage importation from other country and bulk purchasing coverage and reimbursementfor product where third party coverage and reimbursement is available sale will depend in part on the extent to

biopharma acquisition is not completed on the anticipated timetable or at all or if regulatory approval of the acquisition is subject to additional condition we may fail to realize the anticipated benefit of the ge biopharma acquisition on the anticipated timetable or at all the ge biopharma business could under perform relative to our expectation and the price that we pay or not perform in accordance with our anticipated timetable or we could fail to operate such business profitably the ge biopharma acquisition could cause our financial result to differ from our or the investment community expectation in any given period or over the long term pre closing and post closing earnings charge related to the ge biopharma acquisition could adversely impact operating result in any given period and the impact may be substantially different from period to period the ge biopharma acquisition could create demand on our management operational resource and financial and internal control system that we are unable to effectively address the ge biopharma acquisition will divert management attention and other resource which could have negative impact on our ability to manage existing operation or pursue other strategic transaction we could experience difficulty or greater than anticipated cost in integrating the personnel operation and financial and other control and system of ge biopharma and could experience difficulty attracting and retaining key employee and customer we may be unable to achieve anticipated cost saving or other synergy on the timetable we

limit our operation and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit rating and any failure to comply with the covenant that apply to our indebtedness could adversely affect our liquidity and financial statement of december we had approximately billion in outstanding indebtedness including approximately billion of long term debt we issued in to fund portion of the purchase price of the ge biopharma acquisition in addition we had the ability to incur approximately billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowing or under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on the amount available under the company credit facility which were not being used to backstop outstanding commercial paper balance we expect to incur approximately billion of additional indebtedness additional to indebtedness incurred of december to fund portion of the purchase price of the ge biopharma acquisition our debt level and related debt service obligation can have negative consequence including requiring to dedicate significant cash flow from operation to the payment of principal and interest on our debt which reduces the fund we have available for other purpose such acquisition and other investment reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to change in our business and market condition and exposing to interest rate risk since portion of our debt obligation are at variable rate we anticipate that the indebtedness we have incurred and expect to incur in connection with the ge biopharma acquisition will result in negative change to our credit rating compared to our credit rating prior to the public announcement of the ge biopharma acquisition the recent bond issued by dh europe finance ii danaher international ii and guaranteed by danaher corporation were rated bbb by standard poor and by moody each two notch below danaher current long term unsecured debt credit rating upon closing the ge biopharma acquisition we expect danaher long term unsecured debt credit rating to be downgraded to mirror that of the bond issued by danaher international ii this anticipated reduction in our credit rating may limit our ability to borrow at interest rate consistent with the interest rate that have been available to prior to the ge biopharma acquisition if our credit rating are further downgraded or put on watch for further potential downgrade we may not be able to sell additional debt security or borrow money in the amount at the time or interest rate or upon the more favorable term and condition that might be available if our current credit rating were maintained credit facility and long term debt obligation also impose certain restriction on including certain restriction on our ability to incur lien on our asset and requirement under the credit facility to maintain consolidated leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated indebtedness plus shareholder equity of to or le if we breach any of these restriction and can not obtain waiver from the lender on favorable term subject to applicable cure period the outstanding indebtedness and any other indebtedness with cross default provision could be declared immediately

austerity measure and other challenge that affect the global economy have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect the company and it distributor customer and supplier including having the effect of reducing demand for our product and service in this annual report reference to product and service also includes software limiting the financing available to our customer and supplier increasing order cancellation and resulting in longer sale cycle and slower adoption of new technology increasing the difficulty in collecting account receivable and the risk of excess and obsolete inventory increasing price competition in our served market supply interruption which could disrupt our ability to produce our product increasing the risk of impairment of goodwill and other long lived asset and the risk that we may not be able to fully recover the value of other asset such real estate and tax asset increasing the risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangement will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligation which in addition to increasing the risk identified above could result in preference action against and adversely impacting market size and growth rate although we have been able to access the commercial paper and other capital market through the date of this report there can be no assurance that such market will remain available to or that the lender participating in our revolving credit facility will be able to provide financing in accordance with their contractual obligation if growth in the global economy or in any of the market we serve slows for significant period if there is significant deterioration in the global economy or such market or if improvement in the global economy do not benefit the market we serve our business and financial statement could be adversely affected significant development or uncertainty stemming from the administration including change in trade policy tariff and the reaction of other country thereto particularly china can have an adverse effect on our business change potential change or uncertainty in social political regulatory and economic condition or law and policy governing foreign trade manufacturing and development and investment in the territory and country where we or our customer operate or governing the health care system and drug price can adversely affect our business and financial statement for example the administration ha increased tariff on certain good imported into the united state raised the possibility of imposing significant additional tariff increase and called for substantial change to trade agreement in particular trade tension between the united state and china have escalated and each country ha imposed significant additional tariff on wide range of good imported from the other country china accounted for approximately of our sale in these factor have adversely affected and in the future could further adversely affect our business and financial statement growth could suffer if the market into which we sell our product and service decline do not grow anticipated or experience cyclicality our growth depends in part on the growth of the market which we serve and visibility into our market is limited particularly for market into which we sell through distribution our quarterly sale and profit depend substantially on the volume and timing of order received during the fiscal quarter which are difficult to forecast any decline or lower than expected growth in our served market could diminish demand for our product and service which would adversely affect our financial statement certain of our business operate in industry that may experience periodic cyclical downturn in addition in certain of our business demand depends on customer capital spending budget well government funding policy and matter of public policy and government budget dynamic well product and economic cycle can affect the spending decision of these entity demand for our product and service is also sensitive to change in customer order pattern which may be affected by announced price change marketing or promotional program new product introduction the timing of industry trade show and change in distributor or customer inventory level due to distributor or customer management

experience decreased demand and decreased market share even if we compete effectively we may be required to reduce price for our product and service our business operate in industry that are intensely competitive and have been subject to increasing consolidation because of the range of the product and service we sell and the variety of market we serve we encounter wide variety of competitor refer

publication about product reflecting the competitive significance of product quality product efficacy and quality system in our industry our failure to compete effectively and or pricing pressure resulting from competition may adversely impact our financial statement and our expansion into new market may result in greater than expected risk liability and expense in addition the company competitor and customer have from time to time introduced and may in the future introduce private label generic or low cost product that compete with the company product at lower price point competitor product can capture significant market share or lead to decrease in market price overall resulting in an adverse effect on the company financial statement our growth depends in part on the timely development and commercialization and customer acceptance of new and enhanced product and service based on technological innovation we generally sell our product and service in industry that are characterized by rapid technological change frequent new product introduction and changing industry standard if we do not develop innovative new and enhanced product and service on timely basis our offering will become obsolete over time and our competitive position and financial statement will suffer our success will depend on several factor including our ability to correctly identify customer need and preference and predict future need and preference allocate our funding to product and service with higher growth prospect anticipate and respond to our competitor development of new product and service and technological innovation differentiate our offering from our competitor offering and avoid commoditization innovate and develop new technology and application and acquire or

or otherwise dispose of business or asset we may be unable to do so on satisfactory term within our anticipated timeframe or at all and even after reaching definitive agreement to sell or dispose business the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre closing condition which may not become satisfied in addition divestiture or other disposition can dilute the company earnings per share have other adverse financial tax and accounting impact and distract management and dispute can arise with buyer in addition we have retained responsibility for and or have agreed to indemnify buyer against some known and unknown contingent liability related to number of business we or our predecessor have sold or the resolution of these contingency ha not had material effect on our financial statement but we can not be certain that this favorable pattern will continue we could incur significant liability if any of the separation and split off of our communication business the separation and spin off of fortive or the separation ipo and split off of envista is determined to be taxable transaction we have received opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that each of the communication disposition the fortive disposition and the envista disposition qualifies transaction that is described in section and of the internal revenue code these opinion rely on certain fact

time to time we become aware through our internal audit and other internal control procedure employee or other party of possible compliance matter such complaint or concern relating to accounting internal control financial reporting auditing or ethical matter or relating to compliance with law when we become aware of such possible compliance matter we investigate internally and take appropriate corrective action internal investigation can lead to the assertion of claim or the commencement of legal or regulatory proceeding against and adversely affect our financial statement if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property or if third party infringe our intellectual property right we may suffer competitive injury or expend significant resource enforcing our right these risk are particularly pronounced in country in which we do business that do not have level of protection of intellectual property comparable to the united state many of the market we serve are technology driven and result intellectual property right play significant role in product development and differentiation we own numerous patent trademark copyright trade secret and other intellectual property and license to intellectual property owned by others which in aggregate are important to our business the intellectual property right that we obtain however are not always sufficiently broad and do not always provide significant competitive advantage and patent may not be issued for pending or future patent application owned by or licensed to in addition the step that we and our licensors have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property do not always prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented designed around or becoming subject to compulsory licensing in some circumstance enforcement is not available to because an infringer ha dominant intellectual property position or for other business reason we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreement with employee consultant and other party to protect in part trade secret and other proprietary right there can be no assurance that these agreement adequately protect our trade secret and other proprietary right and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedy for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third party will not otherwise gain access to our trade secret or other proprietary right our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property right that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property right can adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement these risk are particularly pronounced in country in which we do business that do not have level of protection of corporate proprietary information intellectual property technology and other asset comparable to the united state the risk we encounter in such country include the following joint venture that we participate in can include restriction that could compromise our control over the intellectual property technology and proprietary information of the joint venture we expand our operation globally increasing amount of our data intellectual property and technology is used and stored in country outside the united state and regulation in certain country require data to be stored locally these factor increase the risk that such data intellectual property and technology could be stolen or otherwise compromised certain of our product have been counterfeited and we may encounter additional and or increased level of counterfeiting in the future governmental entity may adopt regulation or other requirement that give them right to certain of our intellectual property technology and or proprietary information such through compulsory licensing or foreign ownership restriction or requirement in certain country we do not have the same ability to enforce intellectual property right we do in the united state governmental regulation relating to state secrecy or other topic limit our ability to transfer data or technology out of certain jurisdiction risk cost and challenge of operating in particular jurisdiction can result in decision to relocate or divert operation to different jurisdiction potentially at higher cost any of these risk can adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement refer to international economic political legal compliance and business factor could negatively affect our financial statement for discussion of additional risk relating to our international operation third party from time to time claim that we are infringing or misappropriating their intellectual property right and we could suffer significant litigation expense loss or licensing expense or be prevented from selling product or service from time to time we receive notice from third party alleging intellectual property infringement or misappropriation of third party intellectual property and can not be certain that the conduct of our business doe not and will not infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property right of others dispute or litigation regarding intellectual property can be costly and time consuming to defend due to the complexity of many of our technology and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting counterclaim or negotiating license in response to claim of infringement or misappropriation in addition result of such claim of infringement or misappropriation we could lose our right to critical technology be unable to license critical technology or sell critical product and service be required to pay substantial damage or license fee with respect to the infringed right be required to license technology or other intellectual property right from others be required to cease marketing manufacturing or using certain product or be required to redesign re engineer or re brand our product at substantial cost any of which could adversely impact our business including our competitive position and financial statement third party intellectual property right may also make it more difficult or expensive for to meet market demand for particular product or design innovation when we are required to seek license under patent or other intellectual property right of others we are not always able to acquire these license on acceptable term if at all even if we successfully defend against claim of infringement or misappropriation we may incur significant cost and diversion of management attention and resource which could adversely affect our business and financial statement the government ha certain right to use and disclose some of the intellectual property that we license and could exclusively license it to third party if we fail to achieve practical application of the intellectual property certain technology licensed by under agreement with third party licensors is subject to government right government right in invention conceived or reduced to practice under government funded program can include nonexclusive royalty free worldwide license to practice or have practiced such invention for any governmental purpose in addition the government ha the right to require or our licensors applicable to grant license which would be exclusive under any of such invention to third party if they determine that adequate step have not been taken to commercialize such invention in particular field of use such action is necessary to meet public health or safety need or such action is necessary to meet requirement for public use under federal regulation further the government right include the right to use and disclose without limitation technical data relating to licensed technology that wa developed in whole or in part at government expense defect and unanticipated use or inadequate disclosure with respect to our product or service or allegation thereof can adversely affect our business reputation and financial statement manufacturing or design defect or bug in unanticipated use of safety or quality issue or the perception of such issue with respect to off label use of or inadequate disclosure of risk relating to the use of product and service that we make or including item that we source from third party can lead to personal injury death property damage loss of profit or other liability these event can lead to recall or safety alert result in the removal of product or service from the market and result in product liability or similar claim being brought against recall removal and product liability and similar claim regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome result in significant cost well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product and service our business can also be affected by study of the utilization safety and efficacy of medical device product and component that are conducted by industry participant government agency and others any of the above can result in the discontinuation of marketing of such product in one or more country and give rise to claim for damage from person who believe they have been injured result of product issue including claim by individual or group seeking to represent class the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process and if we directly or indirectly encounter problem manufacturing product our reputation business and financial statement could suffer the manufacture of many of our product is highly exacting and complex process due in part to strict regulatory requirement problem can arise during manufacturing for variety of reason including equipment malfunction failure to follow specific protocol and procedure problem with raw material natural disaster and environmental factor and if not discovered before the product is released to market can result in recall and product liability exposure because of the time required to approve and license certain regulated manufacturing facility and other stringent regulation of the fda and similar agency regarding the manufacture of certain of our product an alternative manufacturer is not always available on timely basis to replace such production capacity any of these manufacturing problem could result in significant cost liability and lost revenue loss of market share well negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce demand for our product adverse change in our relationship with or the financial condition performance purchasing pattern or inventory level of key distributor and other channel partner can adversely affect our financial statement certain of our business sell significant amount of their product to or through key distributor and other channel partner that have valuable relationship with customer and end user some of these distributor and other partner also sell our competitor product or compete with directly and if they favor competing product for any reason they may fail to market our product effectively adverse change in our relationship with these distributor and other partner reduction or discontinuation of their purchase from or adverse development in their financial condition performance or purchasing pattern can adversely affect our business and financial statement the level of inventory maintained by our distributor and other channel partner and change in those level also impact our result of operation in any given period in addition the consolidation of distributor and customer in certain of our served industry can adversely impact our business and financial statement certain of our business rely on relationship with collaborative partner and other third party for development supply and marketing of certain product and potential product and such collaborative partner or other third party could fail to perform sufficiently we believe that for certain of our business success in penetrating target market depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationship with other company relying on collaborative relationship is risky because among other thing our collaborative partner may not devote sufficient resource to the success of our collaboration fail to obtain regulatory approval necessary to continue the collaboration in timely manner be acquired by other company and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent compete with disagree with on key detail of the collaborative relationship have insufficient capital resource and decline to renew existing collaboration on acceptable term because these and other factor may be beyond our control the development or commercialization of our product involved in collaborative partnership may be delayed or otherwise adversely affected if we or any of our collaborative partner terminate collaborative arrangement we may be required to devote additional resource to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development program which could adversely affect our business and financial statement our financial result are subject to fluctuation in the cost and availability of commodity that we use in our operation discussed in item business material our manufacturing and other operation employ wide variety of component raw material and other commodity including metallic based component electronic component chemical plastic and other petroleum based product price for and availability of these component raw material and other commodity have fluctuated significantly in the past any sustained interruption in the supply of these item could adversely affect our business in addition due to the highly competitive nature of the industry that we serve the cost containment effort of our customer and the term of certain contract we are party to when commodity price rise we are not always able to pas along cost increase through higher price if we are unable to fully recover higher commodity cost through price increase or offset increase through cost reduction or if there is time delay between the increase in cost and our ability to recover or offset these cost our margin and profitability could decline and our financial statement could be adversely affected if we can not adjust our manufacturing capacity or the purchase required for our manufacturing activity to reflect change in market condition and customer demand our profitability may suffer in addition our reliance upon sole or limited source of supply for certain material component and service can cause production interruption delay and inefficiency we purchase material component and equipment from third party for use in our manufacturing operation including metallic based component electronic component chemical plastic and other petroleum based product our profitability could be adversely impacted if we are unable to adjust our purchase to reflect change in customer demand and market fluctuation including those caused by seasonality or cyclicality during market upturn supplier from time to time extend lead time limit supply or increase price if we can not purchase sufficient product at competitive price and quality and on timely enough basis to meet increasing demand we may not be able to satisfy market demand product shipment may be delayed our cost may increase or we may breach our contractual commitment and incur liability conversely in order to secure supply for the production of product we sometimes enter into noncancelable purchase commitment with vendor which can impact our ability to adjust our inventory to reflect declining market demand if demand for our product is le than we expect we may experience additional excess and obsolete inventory and be forced to incur additional charge and our profitability may suffer in addition some of our business purchase certain requirement from sole or limited source supplier for reason of quality assurance regulatory requirement cost effectiveness availability or uniqueness of design if these or other supplier encounter financial operating or other difficulty or if our relationship with them change we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement source of supply the supply chain for our business can also be disrupted by supplier capacity constraint bankruptcy or exiting of the business for other reason decreased availability of key raw material or commodity and external event such natural disaster pandemic health issue war terrorist action governmental action and legislative or regulatory change any of these factor can result in production interruption delay extended lead time and inefficiency because we can not always immediately adapt our production capacity and related cost structure to changing market condition at time our manufacturing capacity exceeds or fall short of our production requirement any or all of these problem can result in the loss of customer provide an opportunity for competing product to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial statement change in governmental regulation can reduce demand for our product or service or increase our expense we compete in market in which we and our customer must comply with supranational federal state local and other jurisdictional regulation such regulation governing health and safety the environment food and drug privacy and electronic communication we develop configure and market our product and service to meet customer need created by these regulation these regulation are complex change frequently have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdiction any significant change in any of these regulation or in the interpretation or application thereof can reduce demand for increase our cost of producing or delay the introduction of new or modified product and service or restrict our existing activity product and service for example number of our product and service are marketed to the pharmaceutical and related industry for use in discovering and developing drug and therapy change in the fda regulation of the drug discovery and development process can have an adverse effect on the demand for these product and service in addition in certain of our market our growth depends in part upon the introduction of new regulation in these market the delay or failure of governmental and other entity to adopt or enforce new regulation the adoption of new regulation which our product and service are not positioned to address or the repeal of existing regulation can adversely affect demand in addition regulatory deadline can result in substantially different level of demand for our product and service from period to period work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute could adversely impact our productivity and result of operation certain of our and non employee are subject to collective labor arrangement we are subject to potential work stoppage union and work council campaign and other labor dispute any of which could adversely impact our financial statement and business including our productivity and reputation economic political legal compliance and business factor could negatively affect our financial statement in approximately of our sale were derived from customer outside the united state in addition many of our manufacturing operation supplier and employee are located outside the united state since our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to further penetrate market outside the united state and increase the localization of our product and service we expect to continue to increase our sale and presence outside the united state particularly in the high growth market our international business and particularly our business in high growth market is subject to risk that are customarily encountered in non operation including interruption in the transportation of material to and finished good to our customer difference in term of sale including payment term local product preference and product requirement change in country or region political or economic condition such the devaluation of particular currency trade protection measure embargo and import or export restriction and requirement unexpected change in law or regulatory requirement including change in tax law capital control and limitation on ownership and on repatriation of earnings and cash the potential for nationalization of enterprise change in medical reimbursement policy and program limitation on legal right and our ability to enforce such right difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operation differing labor regulation difficulty in implementing restructuring action on timely or comprehensive basis differing protection of intellectual property and greater uncertainty risk expense and delay in commercializing product in certain foreign jurisdiction including with respect to product and other regulatory approval international business risk have in the past and may in the future negatively affect our financial statement business growth rate competitive position and financial condition for example in we generated approximately of our sale from china accordingly our business financial condition and result of operation can be adversely influenced by political economic and social condition in china generally additionally china government continues to play significant role in regulating industry development by imposing industrial policy and it maintains control over china economic growth through setting monetary policy and determining treatment of particular industry or company further considerable uncertainty exists regarding the long term effect of the expansionary monetary and fiscal policy adopted by the central bank and financial authority of some of the world leading economy including the united state and china uncertainty or adverse change to economic condition in china or the policy of china government or it law and regulation can have material adverse effect on the overall economic growth of china and can impact our business and operating result reducing demand for our product and adversely affecting our financial statement business growth rate and competitive position and financial condition in addition our global operation expose to risk associated with public health crisis and epidemic such the novel strain of coronavirus that recently originated in china covid which could adversely impact our operation supply chain and distribution system and reduce demand for our product and service while we believe the coronavirus may have negative impact on our financial result the impact is difficult to ass at this time significant development stemming from the uk referendum decision to exit the eu could have an adverse effect on in referendum on june voter in the uk voted for the uk to exit the eu the uk formally withdrew from the eu on january with transition period through december during the transition period the uk will continue to follow eu law and will negotiate with the eu on the term of it relationship it stand the term and the nature of the future relationship with the eu post are still being decided this referendum and withdrawal ha caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty including significant volatility in global stock market and currency exchange rate fluctuation if no agreement is reached by december the uk membership in the eu could terminate under so called hard brexit the effect of brexit will depend on many factor including any agreement that the uk make to retain access to eu market either during transitional period or more permanently brexit
