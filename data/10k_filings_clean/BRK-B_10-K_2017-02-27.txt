below the risk and uncertainty described below are not the only risk we face additional risk and uncertainty that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operation we are dependent on few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decision major investment decision and all major capital allocation decision are made by warren buffett chairman of the board of director and ceo age in consultation with charles munger vice chairman of the board of director age if for any reason the service of our key personnel particularly mr buffett were to become unavailable there could be material adverse effect on our operation however berkshire board of director ha identified certain current berkshire subsidiary manager who in their judgment are capable of succeeding mr buffett berkshire board ha agreed on replacement for mr buffett should replacement be needed currently the board continually monitor this risk and could alter it current view regarding replacement for mr buffett in the future we believe that the board succession plan together with the outstanding manager running our numerous and highly diversified operating unit help to mitigate this risk we need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various business in our decentralized business model we need qualified and competent management to direct day to day business activity of our operating subsidiary our operating subsidiary also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their business plan and serving their customer supplier and other stakeholder change in demographic training requirement and the unavailability of qualified personnel could negatively impact one or more of our significant operating subsidiary ability to meet demand of customer to supply good and service recruiting and retaining qualified personnel is important to all of our operation although we have adequate personnel for the current business environment unpredictable increase in demand for good and service may exacerbate the risk of not having sufficient number of trained personnel which could have negative impact on our operating result financial condition and liquidity the past growth rate in berkshire book value per share is not an indication of future result in the year since present management acquired control of berkshire our book value per share ha grown at highly satisfactory rate because of the large size of our capital base berkshire shareholder equity wa approximately billion of december our book value per share will very likely not increase in the future at rate close to it past rate investment are unusually concentrated and fair value are subject to loss in value we concentrate high percentage of the investment of our insurance subsidiary in relatively small number of equity security and diversify our investment portfolio far le than is conventional in the insurance industry significant decline in the fair value of our larger investment may produce material decline in our consolidated shareholder equity and our consolidated book value per share under certain circumstance required under existing gaap significant decline in the table of content fair value of these investment may require the recognition of other than temporary impairment loss in addition beginning in due to pending change in gaap all change in the fair value of these investment whether realized or unrealized will be recognized gain or loss in our consolidated statement of earnings accordingly periodic change in reported earnings will likely be subject to significant variability since large percentage of our investment are held in our insurance subsidiary decrease in the fair value of our investment could produce large decline in statutory surplus our large statutory surplus is competitive advantage and material decline could have materially adverse affect on our claim paying ability rating and our ability to write new insurance business thus affecting our future underwriting profitability competition and technology may erode our business franchise and result in lower earnings each of our operating business face intense competitive pressure within market in which they operate while we manage our business with the objective of achieving long term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitive advantage many factor including market and technology change may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitive advantage accordingly future operating result will depend to some degree on whether our operating unit are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantage if our operating business are unsuccessful in these effort our periodic operating result in the future may decline deterioration of general economic condition may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability to access capital market at reasonable cost our operating business are subject to normal economic cycle affecting the economy in general or the industry in which they operate to the extent that the economy deteriorates for prolonged period of time one or more of our significant operation could be materially harmed in addition our utility and energy business our railroad business and our manufactured housing business regularly utilize debt component of their capital structure these business depend on having access to borrowed fund through the capital market at reasonable rate to the extent that access to the capital market is restricted or the cost of funding increase these operation could be adversely affected terrorist act against the united state could hurt our operating business successful defined by the aggressor cyber biological nuclear or chemical attack against the united state could produce significant loss to our worldwide operation our business operation could be adversely affected directly through the loss of human resource or destruction of production facility and information system this is risk that we share with all based business regulatory change may adversely impact our future operating result in recent year partially in response to financial market crisis global economic recession and social and environmental issue regulatory initiative have accelerated in the united state and abroad such initiative address for example the regulation of bank and other major financial institution environmental and global warming matter and health care reform these initiative impact not only our regulated insurance energy and railroad transportation business but also our manufacturing service retailing and financing business increased regulatory compliance cost could have significant negative impact on our operating business well on the business in which we have significant but not controlling economic interest we can not predict whether such initiative will have material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position result of operation or cash flow cyber security risk we rely on information technology in virtually all aspect of our business significant disruption or failure of our information technology system could result in service interruption safety failure security violation regulatory compliance failure an inability to protect information and asset against intruder and other operational difficulty attack perpetrated against our information system could result in loss of asset and critical information and expose to remediation cost and reputational damage although we have taken step intended to mitigate these risk including business continuity planning disaster recovery planning and business impact analysis significant disruption or cyber intrusion could lead to misappropriation of asset or data corruption and could adversely affect our result of operation financial condition and liquidity additionally if we are table of content unable to acquire or implement new technology we may suffer competitive disadvantage which could also have an adverse effect on our result of operation financial condition and liquidity cyber attack could further adversely affect our ability to operate facility information technology and business system or compromise confidential customer and employee information political economic social or financial market instability or damage to or interference with our operating asset or our customer or supplier may result in business interruption lost revenue higher commodity price disruption in fuel supply lower energy consumption unstable market increased security and repair or other cost any of which may materially adversely affect in way that can not be predicted at this time any of these risk could materially affect our consolidated financial result furthermore instability in the financial market result of terrorism sustained or significant cyber attack or war could also materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital derivative contract may require significant future cash settlement payment and result in significant loss we have assumed the risk of potentially significant loss under equity index put option contract although we received considerable premium compensation for accepting these risk there is no assurance that the premium we received will exceed our aggregate settlement payment risk of loss under our equity index put option contract are based on decline in equity price of stock comprising certain major stock index when these contract expire beginning in we could be required to make significant payment if equity index price are significantly below the strike price specified in the contract equity index put option contract are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the periodic change in fair value are reported in earnings the valuation of these contract and the impact on our periodic earnings can be particularly significant reflecting the inherent volatility of equity market adverse change in equity may result in material loss in periodic earnings risk unique to our regulated business our tolerance for risk in our insurance business may result in significant underwriting loss when properly paid for the risk assumed we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from single event than any other insurer ha knowingly assumed accordingly we could incur significant loss from single event we may also write coverage for loss arising from act of terrorism we attempt to take into account all possible correlation and avoid writing group of policy from which pre tax loss might aggregate billion currently we estimate that our aggregate exposure from single event under outstanding policy is significantly below billion however despite our effort loss may aggregate in unanticipated way our tolerance for significant insurance loss may result in lower reported earnings or net loss in future period the degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reserve may result in significant underwriting loss the principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claim in writing property and casualty insurance policy we receive premium today and promise to pay covered loss in the future however it will take decade before all claim that have occurred of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled although we believe that liability for unpaid loss are adequate we will not know whether these liability or the premium charged for the coverage provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date except for certain product line our objective is to generate underwriting profit over the long term estimating insurance claim cost is inherently imprecise our estimated unpaid loss arising under contract covering property and casualty insurance risk are large billion at december even small percentage increase to the aggregate liability estimate can result in materially lower future periodic reported earnings change in regulation and regulatory action can adversely affect our operating result and our ability to allocate capital our insurance business are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which we operate such regulation may relate to among other thing the type of business that can be written the rate that can be charged for coverage the level of capital that must be maintained and restriction on the type and size of investment that can be made regulation

necessarily involve varying and possibly significant degree of uncertainty accordingly certain amount currently recorded in the financial statement will likely be adjusted in the future based on new available information and change in other fact and circumstance property and casualty loss we record liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense based upon estimate of the ultimate amount payable for loss occurring on or before the balance sheet date except for certain worker compensation reinsurance claim we record all liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense referred to in this section gross unpaid loss in the consolidated balance sheet without discounting for time value the timing and amount of ultimate loss payment are contingent upon among other thing the timing of claim reporting from insured and ceding company and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment process we use variety of technique in establishing liability and all technique require significant judgment and assumption we believe the process and technique utilized best suit the underlying claim and available data of any balance sheet date recorded liability include provision for reported claim well claim not yet reported and the development of reported claim the period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the claim tail property claim usually have relatively short claim tail absent litigation casualty claim usually have longer claim tail occasionally extending for decade casualty claim may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretation the legal environment and judicial process further contributes to extending claim tail our liability of december were billion of which related to geico general re and bhrg additional information regarding significant uncertainty inherent in the process and technique of geico general re and bhrg follows geico geico predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance of december geico gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense were billion and unpaid loss net of reinsurance recoverable were billion geico claim reserving methodology produce liability estimate based upon the individual claim the key assumption affecting our liability estimate include projection of ultimate claim count frequency and average loss per claim severity we utilize combination of several actuarial estimation method including bornhuetter ferguson and chain ladder methodology liability estimate for automobile liability coverage such bodily injury bi uninsured motorist and personal injury protection are more uncertain due to the longer claim tail so we establish additional case development estimate of december case development liability averaged approximately of the case reserve we select case development factor through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liability for unreported claim ibnr liability are based on projection of the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported for each significant coverage we use historical claim count data to develop age to age projection of the ultimate count by quarterly accident period from which we deduct reported claim to produce the number of unreported claim we estimate the average cost per unreported claim and apply such estimate to the unreported claim count producing an ibnr liability estimate we may record additional ibnr estimate when actuarial technique are difficult to apply for significant coverage we test the adequacy of the aggregate liability for unpaid loss using one or more actuarial projection based on claim closure model and paid and incurred loss triangle each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claim occurring in given period and project the ultimate cost unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability estimate recorded at the end of developed downward by million when reevaluated through december which produced corresponding increase to pre tax earnings in we modified the assumption used to estimate liability at december appropriate to reflect the most recent frequency and severity result future development of recorded liability will depend on whether actual frequency and severity are more or le than anticipated table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued geico continued with respect to liability for bi claim our most significant claim category we believe it is reasonably possible that average severity will change by at least one percentage point from the severity used in establishing the recorded liability at december we estimate that one percentage point increase or decrease in bi severity would produce million increase or decrease in recorded liability with corresponding decrease or increase in pre tax earnings many of the same economic force that would likely cause bi severity to differ from expectation would likely also cause severity for other injury coverage to differ in the same direction general re and bhrg liability for unpaid property and casualty loss and loss adjustment expense of general re and bhrg derive primarily from reinsurance contract in connection with reinsurance contract the nature extent timing and perceived reliability of information received from ceding company varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting term contract term condition and coverage also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly than primary insurance policy the nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative individual risk per occurrence excess or retroactive reinsurance contract may not differ significantly from the information received under primary insurance contract if reinsurer personnel either work closely with the ceding company in settling individual claim or manage the claim themselves however loss information is often le detailed with respect to aggregate excess of loss and quota share contract additionally loss information we receive through periodic report is often in summary format rather than on an individual claim basis loss data includes recoverable paid loss well case loss estimate ceding company infrequently provide ibnr estimate to reinsurers loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurer periodic premium and claim report are required from ceding company in the such report are generally required at quarterly interval ranging from to day after the end of the accounting period outside of the reinsurance reporting practice may vary further in certain country client report annually often to day after the end of the annual period in some instance reinsurers assume and cede underlying risk thereby creating multiple contractual intermediary between and the primary insured potentially compounding the claim reporting delay the relative impact of reporting delay on the reinsurer may vary depending on the type of coverage contractual reporting term and the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurance contract and for other reason the premium and loss data we receive is through at least one intermediary the primary insurer so there is risk that the loss data reported is incomplete inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage term when received we review the information for completeness and compliance with the contract term generally our reinsurance contract permit to access the ceding company book and record with respect to the subject business thus providing the ability to audit the reported information in the normal course of business dispute occasionally arise concerning whether claim are covered by our reinsurance policy we resolve most coverage dispute through negotiation with the client if dispute can not be resolved our contract generally provide arbitration litigation or alternative dispute resolution process there are no coverage dispute at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have material impact on our consolidated result of operation or financial condition general re information concerning general re gross and net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense of december follows in million type line of business reported case liability liability and worker compensation ibnr liability property gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense total reinsurance recoverable and deferred charge net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense net of discount of approximately billion table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued general re continued for general re the critical process involved in estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense include the establishment of case liability estimate the determination of expected loss ratio which drive ibnr liability estimate and the comparison of reported loss trend to the expected loss reporting pattern recorded liability are subject to tail risk where reported loss are beyond the expected loss emergence period our process for estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense begin with case loss estimate made by the ceding company upon notification of reinsurance claim from ceding company we independently evaluate the case loss reported and if appropriate we use our own case liability estimate of december our case loss estimate exceeded ceding company estimate by approximately billion which were concentrated in the worker compensation line we also periodically conduct detailed review of individual client claim which may cause to adjust our case estimate in estimating ibnr liability we consider expected case loss emergence and development pattern together with expected loss ratio by year in this process we classify all loss and premium data into segment cell based primarily on product type treaty facultative and program line of business auto liability property and worker compensation and geographic jurisdiction for each cell we aggregate premium and loss by accident year policy year or underwriting year and analyze the data over time there are several hundred cell we use loss triangle to determine the expected development of reported claim for most coverage which together with the expected loss ratio are used to calculate ibnr liability estimate we select expected loss ratio by cell and by year based upon indicated ultimate loss ratio and forecasted loss obtained from pricing statistic indicated ultimate loss ratio are determined from the selected loss emergence pattern reported loss and earned premium factor affecting our loss development triangle include but are not limited to change in the following client claim practice the frequency of client company claim review policy term and coverage such loss retention level and occurrence and aggregate policy limit loss trend and legal trend that result in unanticipated loss collectively these factor influence our selection of expected loss emergence pattern the ibnr liability are determined we estimate the expected case loss emergence for the upcoming calendar year based on the prior year end expected loss emergence pattern and expected loss ratio we allocate the expected loss into interim estimate which we compare to actual reported loss this comparison provides test of the adequacy of prior year end ibnr liability and form the basis for possibly changing ibnr liability assumption during the course of the year during we reduced net loss for prior year occurrence by million in the aggregate this reduction produced corresponding increase in pre tax earnings reported claim for prior year property loss event were le than expected and we reduced our estimated ultimate liability by million however property loss incurred during any given period may be more volatile because of the effect of catastrophe and large individual property loss event in reported nominal loss for prior year worker compensation were le than expected which after reevaluating expected remaining ibnr estimate resulted in reduction of nominal liability by million however we discount worker compensation liability and after adjusting for change in discount worker compensation loss for prior year occurrence had minimal impact on pre tax earnings an increase of ten percent in the tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and an increase of ten percent in the expected loss ratio would produce net increase in discounted worker compensation ibnr liability of approximately million producing corresponding decrease in pre tax earnings we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate other casualty and general liability reported loss excluding mass tort loss were le than expected in resulting in million increase in pre tax earnings however casualty loss tend to be long tailed and it should not be assumed that favorable loss experience in given period will continue in the future for our significant casualty and general liability cell we estimate that an increase of five percent in the claim tail of the expected loss emergence pattern and five percent increase in expected loss ratio would produce net increase in our nominal ibnr liability and corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings of approximately million while we believe it is reasonably possible for these assumption to increase at these rate more likely outcome are le than million given the diversification in worldwide business table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued general re continued overall industry wide loss experience data and informed judgment are used when internal loss data is of limited reliability such for mass tort asbestos and hazardous waste collectively mass tort liability estimate general re net liability for such loss at december wa approximately billion which included an increase in estimated ultimate loss of million during which produced corresponding reduction in pre tax earnings mass tort loss estimation are difficult to determine due to the changing legal environment and increase may be required in the future if new exposure or claimant are identified new claim are reported or new theory of liability emerge in addition to the previously described methodology we consider survival ratio which is the average net claim payment in recent year in relation to net unpaid loss rough guide to reserve adequacy general re survival ratio wa approximately year of december bhrg summary of bhrg unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense of december follows in million property casualty total reported case liability ibnr liability retroactive reinsurance liability gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense deferred charge and reinsurance recoverable net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense we use variety of actuarial methodology to establish unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense certain methodology such paid and incurred loss development technique incurred and paid loss bornhuetter ferguson technique and frequency and severity technique are utilized well ground up technique when appropriate large percentage of bhrg unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense derive from retroactive reinsurance contract which relate to loss event occurring before the contract inception date gross liability with respect to such contract were approximately billion at december and were predominately for casualty and liability coverage we expect the claim tail related to certain of these contract to be very long we establish aggregate liability estimate by individual contract considering exposure and development trend in establishing retroactive reinsurance liability we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment pattern and project expected loss under various scenario we assign judgmental probability factor to these scenario and an expected outcome is determined we monitor loss payment activity and review ceding company report and other information concerning the underlying loss and we re estimate expected ultimate loss when significant event are reported or revealed certain of our contract include significant exposure to asbestos environmental and other latent injury claim we estimate that our liability for such claim were approximately billion at december we do not receive consistently reliable information regarding asbestos environmental and latent injury claim data from all ceding company particularly with respect to multi line or aggregate excess of loss policy periodically we conduct detailed analysis of the underlying loss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured loss when detailed loss information is unavailable we develop estimate by applying recent industry trend and projection to aggregate client data judgment in these area necessarily consider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect these claim will be adjudicated legal reform and legislation could also have significant impact on our ultimate liability change in ultimate estimated liability for prior year retroactive reinsurance contract were relatively insignificant in were change in the estimated timing and amount of remaining unpaid loss in we paid loss and loss adjustment expense of approximately billion with respect to these contract table of content management discussion and analysis continued property and casualty loss continued bhrg continued we currently believe that maximum loss payable under our retroactive policy will not exceed billion due to the aggregate contract limit that are applicable to most of these contract absent significant judicial or legislative change affecting asbestos environmental or latent injury exposure we also currently believe it unlikely that loss will develop upward to the maximum loss payable or downward by more than of our year end estimate we also record deferred charge with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contract which at contract inception represents the excess if any of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid loss over premium unamortized deferred charge were approximately billion at december which will be amortized and charged to pre tax earnings in the future based on the expected timing and amount of loss payment significant change in such estimate may have significant effect on unamortized deferred charge and the amount of periodic amortization based on the contract in effect of december and the new aig contract we currently estimate that amortization expense in will approximate million gross unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense liability related to property and casualty contract other than retroactive reinsurance were approximately billion of december and consisted primarily of traditional property and casualty coverage written primarily under excess of loss and quota share treaty these coverage included catastrophe and aviation contract that tend to generate low frequency high severity loss although such liability have diminished in recent year due to decline in business written reserving technique for catastrophe and individual risk contract generally rely more on per policy assessment of the ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development pattern of past loss we generally establish liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense for these contract based upon loss estimate reported by ceding company and ibnr reserve that are primarily function of reported loss from ceding company and anticipated loss ratio established on portfolio basis supplemented by management estimate of the impact of major catastrophe event they become known in we decreased estimated ultimate loss for prior year occurrence by approximately million which primarily derived from lower than expected loss reported by ceding company the decrease produced corresponding increase in pre tax earnings derivative contract liability we measure derivative contract liability at fair value our most significant derivative contract exposure relate to equity index put option contract written between and we believe that the fair value produced for long duration option are inherently subjective actual value in an exchange may differ significantly from the value produced by any mathematical model transaction value may also reflect perception of individual buyer and seller well other change in market condition we determine the fair value of equity index put option contract using black scholes based option valuation model input to the model include the current index value strike price interest rate dividend rate and contract expiration date the weighted average interest and dividend rate used of december were and respectively the interest rate were approximately basis point on weighted average basis over benchmark interest rate at the end of and represented our estimate of our nonperformance risk we believe that the most significant economic risk under these contract relate to change in the index value component and to lesser degree the foreign currency component the black scholes based model also incorporates volatility estimate that measure potential price change over time our contract have an average remaining maturity of about four year the weighted average volatility used of december wa approximately we determine the weighted average volatility based on the volatility input for each contract weighted by the contract notional value the volatility input for each contract reflects our expectation of future price volatility the potential impact from change in our volatility assumption are follows dollar in million fair value at december hypothetical change in volatility hypothetical fair value increase percentage point increase percentage point decrease percentage point decrease percentage point table of content management discussion and analysis continued other critical accounting policy our consolidated balance sheet at december included goodwill of acquired business of billion we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and we conducted our most recent annual review during the fourth quarter of our review includes determining the estimated fair value of our reporting unit there are several method of estimating reporting unit fair value including market quotation underlying asset and liability fair value determination and other valuation technique such discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flow and multiple of earnings we primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow method the key assumption and input used in such method may include forecasting revenue and expense operating cash flow and capital expenditure well an appropriate discount rate and other input significant amount of judgment is required in estimating the fair value of reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment test due to the inherent uncertainty in forecasting cash flow and earnings actual result may vary significantly from the forecast if the carrying amount of reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value then required by gaap we estimate the fair value of the identifiable asset and liability of the reporting unit the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit over the estimated fair value of it net asset establishes the implied value of goodwill the excess of the recorded amount of goodwill over the implied goodwill value is charged to earnings an impairment loss market risk disclosure our consolidated balance sheet include substantial amount of asset and liability whose fair value are subject to market risk our significant market risk are primarily associated with equity price interest rate foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price the fair value of our investment portfolio and equity index put option contract remain subject to considerable volatility the following section address the significant market risk associated with our business activity equity price risk historically equity security have represented significant portion of our investment portfolio strategically we strive to invest in business that posse excellent economics and able and honest management and at sensible price and we prefer to invest meaningful amount in each investee consequently equity investment are concentrated in relatively few issuer at december approximately of the total fair value of equity security and other investment wa concentrated in five issuer we often hold our equity investment for long period and short term price volatility ha and will occur we are not necessarily disturbed by market price decline provided the underlying business economic and management characteristic of the investees remain favorable we strive to maintain significant level of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide margin of safety against short term price volatility market price for equity security are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value fluctuation in the market price of security may result from perceived change in the underlying economic characteristic of the investee the relative price of alternative investment and general market condition we are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contract while our ultimate liability with respect to these contract is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception date and expiration date fair value of these contract are also affected by change in other factor such interest rate expected dividend rate and the remaining duration of the

other interest rate sensitive instrument our strategy is to acquire security that are attractively priced relative to the perceived credit risk our management recognizes and accepts that loss may occur we also issue debt in the ordinary course of business to fund business operation business acquisition and for other general purpose we strive to maintain high credit rating so to minimize the cost of our debt we rarely utilize derivative product such interest rate swap to manage interest rate risk the fair value of our fixed maturity investment and note payable and other borrowing will fluctuate in response to change in market interest rate in addition change in interest rate assumption used in our equity index put option contract model cause change in reported liability with respect to those contract increase and decrease in interest rate generally translate into decrease and increase in fair value of those instrument additionally fair value of interest rate sensitive instrument may be affected by the creditworthiness of the issuer prepayment option relative value of alternative investment the liquidity of the instrument and other general market condition the fair value of fixed interest rate instrument are usually more sensitive to interest rate change than variable rate instrument table of content management discussion and analysis continued interest rate risk continued the following table summarizes the estimated effect of hypothetical change in interest rate on our significant asset and liability that are subject to interest rate risk we assumed that the interest rate change occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risk and that there are no significant change to other factor used to determine the value of the instrument the hypothetical change in interest rate do not reflect the best or worst case scenario variation in interest rate could produce significant change in the timing of repayment

to price risk related to various commodity in most instance we attempt to manage these risk through the pricing of our product and service to customer to the extent that we are unable to sustain price

cash and cash equivalent and treasury bill cash equivalent consist of demand deposit and money market account treasury bill with maturity of three month or le when purchased and other investment with maturity of three month or le when purchased during we acquired significant amount of treasury bill with maturity date more than three month from their purchase date in prior year such investment were not material and were classified cash equivalent we believe that in substance these treasury bill are like cash they are readily convertible to known amount of cash and present an insignificant risk of change in value because of change in interest rate in determining the appropriate accounting classification under gaap we considered the relevant accounting literature we also consulted with our independent auditor who shared with certain insight into commonly applied practice today we have concluded that notwithstanding our view of the substance of such instrument these treasury bill technically do not meet bright line definition of cash equivalent under gaap accordingly we are now presenting all treasury bill with maturity date greater than three month from their purchase date separately in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet additionally we have revised the and consolidated statement of cash flow to reflect this change we believe that these change have no effect whatsoever on our financial condition investment we determine the appropriate classification of investment in fixed maturity and equity security at the acquisition date and re evaluate the classification at each balance sheet date held to maturity investment are carried at amortized cost reflecting the ability and intent to hold the security to maturity trading investment are security acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carried at fair value all other security are classified available for sale and are carried at fair value with net unrealized gain or loss reported component of accumulated other comprehensive income substantially all of our investment in equity and fixed maturity security are classified available for sale we utilize the equity method to

is presumed when an investor posse more than of the voting interest of the investee this presumption may be table of content note to consolidated financial statement continued significant accounting policy and practice continued investment continued overcome based on specific fact and circumstance that demonstrate that the ability to exercise significant influence is restricted we apply the equity method to investment in common stock and to other investment when such other investment posse substantially identical subordinated interest to common stock in applying the equity method we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or loss and other comprehensive income of the investee we record dividend or other equity distribution reduction in the carrying value of the investment in the event that net loss of the investee reduce the carrying amount to zero additional net loss may be recorded if other investment in the investee are at risk even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee such additional equity method loss if any are based upon the change in our claim on the investee book value investment gain and loss arise when investment are sold determined on specific identification basis or are other than temporarily impaired if decline in the value of an investment below cost is deemed other than temporary the cost of the investment is written down to fair value with corresponding charge to earnings factor considered in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary include the financial condition business prospect and creditworthiness of the issuer the relative amount of the decline our ability and intent to hold the investment until the fair value recovers and the length of time that fair value ha been le than cost with respect to an investment in fixed maturity security we recognize an other than temporary impairment if we intend to sell or expect to be required to sell the security before it amortized cost is recovered or do not expect to ultimately recover the amortized cost basis even if we do not intend to sell the security under scenario we recognize loss in earnings and under scenario we recognize the credit loss component in earnings and the difference between fair value and the amortized

expense once the fact and merit of the claim are evaluated estimate for liability coverage are more uncertain primarily due to the longer claim tail the greater chance of protracted litigation and the incompleteness of fact at the time the case estimate is first established the claim tail is the time period between the claim occurrence date and settlement date result we establish additional case development liability which are usually percentage of the case liability for unreported claim ibnr liability are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claim expected reported and unreported
